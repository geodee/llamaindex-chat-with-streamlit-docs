Title: Thrown in the deep end
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Samantha Speisman

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So welcome to the show, Sam.

Samantha Speisman:
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm so glad that you're here.

Samantha Speisman:
Me too. I'm so thrilled to be here. It's such a nice way to start a morning.

Christine Laperriere:
And before we dive in, why don't you just tell our listeners your title and who you are really quick.

Samantha Speisman:
Sure. So I'm Sam Speisman, Head of Content at Newsworthy and The Bullet. The Bullet is a daily news digest, comes out in the morning, really shares everything you need to know to start your day from hard news to the more lighthearted stuff. And then, Newsworthy is a white label publisher. So we create content for other brands.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. And before we get started, I think what's so neat about why I invited you on the show was that you helped me produce The Whipp, which is my newsletter, and you're brilliant. But when I was telling you about this passion project of wanting to start Best Boss Ever, you immediately lit up, your face lit up and you couldn't help it. You just started telling me about your best boss ever, and I was all grins ear to ear. The best part of the whole story is that after she got done telling me about her best boss ever, I had a hunch that I knew who she was talking about. And next thing you know, we realized that we both knew this leader and I actually could even identify her from that story, so I think this one has to be on the show. So with that, I mean, do tell us a little bit about who your best boss ever is.

Samantha Speisman:
Well, I think the reason why I was so excited about the concept is, for me, my best boss ever came very early in my career. So she had a huge impact on the steps that I took after that first foray into the corporate world. I mean, her name is Stephania Varalli. I'm just going to cut to the chase there. She now works, I think, as one of the owners of Women of Influence, Head of Media over there, I believe. We've run in the same circles for the last 15 years, but she was my first manager. She was the editorial director at sweetspot.ca, which was a small business, first digital women's magazine in Canada, and I started there as an intern.

Samantha Speisman:
So you can imagine the impact that someone at that level would have on someone who is just starting her career and how the lessons she taught me would impact me as I moved through. So as soon as you told me about this, I immediately knew I had to talk about Steph because, like I said, she's really had an impact on me over the last 13, it's either been 13 or 15 years that I've been working in industry, so it was a natural fit.

Christine Laperriere:
So give us some of the examples, like when I say that who's your best boss ever, I mean, your face just lights up. Obviously, there are some experiences that you had working for her that stood out right away.

Samantha Speisman:
Sure. I think that it was obviously a product of the culture. I still work with Joanna Track who founded Sweetspot, and I know a lot of that really came from Joanna's view on how business should be run, but so much of what Steph built with the editorial team specifically really centered around trust and building self-confidence. So as an intern, you come into a fully female team, and this is really hindsight because after Sweetspot, I left and worked at other places where this was not the case.

Samantha Speisman:
But Steph really fostered a environment of camaraderie. She always trusted her team members to take ownership over whether it was writing or events. So for example, when I was just starting, she would always encourage me to write things that I probably had no business writing because I was just starting, and she would often edit the crap out of them. But still, to me, that opportunity to really flex my writing skills, even when I was still starting and knowing that it would probably be more work for her, she was really committed to teaching and giving us those experiences to help our careers and help us grow.

Samantha Speisman:
And even other little things like going to press events which, after 13 years, I understand are one of the best perks of working in this industry. But she would often allow the interns and some of the more junior team members to go to these events and really trusted us to represent the brand from an early point where, as I've learned over the course of the last now 10 years, almost 10 years since Sweetspot shut down, is not the case at most places. And there's a different energy in many corporate environments where there's a lot of seniority and hierarchy. If you're more senior, then you get to go to these events, and if you're more junior, then you don't.

Samantha Speisman:
I think that trust that she instilled in the team and allowed us to build helped shape all of our self-confidences. And if you look at that team and where they are now, almost every single person is working in quite senior roles at various companies. I think it's really a testament to that initial trust that she showed to us and let us go off on our own probably earlier than we should have.

Samantha Speisman:
Yeah, I think that that was a huge part of it and really just the freedom and the inspiration that came with all of that and just the pleasant environment that I think that she also fostered, which I've taken forward and try to build both at my previous role, which was a big corporate company, and now working at a small business.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. And so, it sounds like she threw you in the deep end even when you were just an intern, just starting out, and then she gave you the latitude to take a swing at it on your own even if she had to do some heavy lifting to help get the quality of the work up to where it needed to be. She still put you out there and let you see what you were capable of.

Samantha Speisman:
Absolutely. And I think that that's something that I'm seeing now from her perspective in my current role, which is as you hire more junior team members and you want them to learn and grow and mentor and teach, it is more work to facilitate that journey and to help them grow. It's often easier to just do it yourself, but I think realizing now the efforts and the lengths she went to to really help those who are starting hone those skills again at a detriment to her. And she probably is where I get a lot of my work ethic because I know it took more work for her to run the team in this way. I would often get edits back from her 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM not expecting a response. I'm not suggesting that she really know-

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right.

Samantha Speisman:
... but just seeing that she was working additional hours. And I know that a lot of that came down to giving us the opportunity to learn and grow and taking the time to critique our work, send it back to us, and let us know really where we were going wrong. I think I'm definitely a better writer for it and certainly a better editor at this point. But yeah, it was definitely that work ethic and the trust that she showed in all of us, I think, that stuck with... And I speak to many of the people on her team regularly that really stuck with us over the years.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And did she ever get frustrated, though? I mean, because I know as you're building up a young team or a new team, you're teaching and reteaching and reteaching sometimes. And so, I'm just curious. I mean, how did she deal with that? I mean, did you see that?

Samantha Speisman:
I mean, I can't say for sure that it didn't happen. I certainly never felt it in a negative way. I've seen other leaders, obviously not Steph, but I've seen other leaders over my career who really let their frustration show and can often belittle and really come down hard on juniors. I never felt that way. I never saw it. If it happened, it happened behind closed doors, and I was [crosstalk 00:08:56] to it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. That's interesting. I mean, what I'm hearing if we were really summarizing the qualities that made this particular best boss ever, it was the willingness to throw you in the deep end and see what you could do, which fostered a self-confidence in you. It helped you build your skill really quickly, which is really impressive. But I'm also hearing an element of patience. And then, I think there's... Because what I'm really trying to do right now is dissect those qualities that make for that best boss ever because we talk about all these things in very general terms, and leadership training and leadership jargon. We talk about trust, and trust is there's a lot of elements to that. What does that actually look like? But when I'm hearing is that she trusted you to run with the ball. So there's an element of delegation here. There is an element of trust. There's an element of really helping you build up your skills to the top level that you could and also a level of patience. So I think that is a pretty powerful combination when you think of what your best boss ever actually looks like.

Christine Laperriere:
Can I ask you a question about your, let's call it your worst boss ever or an experience? This isn't about trash talking, although it's always fun to trash talk a little bit, but it's not so much about trash talk. What is the thing that you remember so specifically that really didn't work for you where you're like, "I would not work for that person or a person with that quality again"?

Samantha Speisman:
So I think the number one quality that has turned me off consistently over the last however many years is insecurity. It's become such a pervasive quality in maybe my industry because there's so many changes in publishing. And for as long as I've worked in digital media, it's always been seen as the cousin or the nasty family member that nobody really wants to acknowledge because they're going to throw a wrench in the dinner or the party or whatever, because when I worked in digital media at the very beginning of my career as an intern, it was coming for print. Print was always worried about digital. And then, my second long-term career was in broadcasting. And so, same idea. Digital media was coming for broadcast and for television, and people were cutting cable and all these things.

Samantha Speisman:
So I've dealt with insecure bosses time and time again, and I think that that's one quality that I always try to... If I even feel it coming in, I recognize it and I push it away because it makes everything else so much more challenging. It fosters such a negative environment. And the people who work for you, they feel that insecurity. And it's okay to be worried about job security in this day and age. It happens all the time. But to manage from that point and to feel like you need to prove yourself because you're insecure about your future, your insecure about your role at the company, I think that's the most negative trait that I've witnessed, the most toxic trait that I've witnessed in the workplace. It really does trickle down into every decision and the way that your team feels.

Samantha Speisman:
And that really started with my worst boss ever because, like I said, it was worry about the future of their particular industry, their particular role, and having a digital media. I don't want to say expert, but someone who's worked in digital media for years who really understands that space felt like a threat.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.And the minute they feel threatened by their own team, you're now sparring against one another versus truly working together to get there fastest.

Samantha Speisman:
Absolutely. And you're not thinking about the company or brand or product that you're building. You're thinking about what is going to further my role, what's going to make me look better, how am I going to carve a space for myself in the future. And if you feel that your team's skillset or the priorities that your team is focused on don't align with your future and your role, then the decisions you make are not going to be for the benefit of your team or for the brand company product.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. I think you nailed it. I think insecurity is absolutely something that I noticed time and time again in my own experiences of working for different people. And even today coaching so many leaders, I think insecurity really clouds good decision-making, good people skills, good communication. Unfortunately, there's a lot of environments where I think of... I think your word of toxic is the right word because insecurity is catchy. If your boss is insecure, then all of a sudden you start to wonder why you're feeling so confident. So the interesting thing is is when you see insecurity happening somewhere in the top of the house, a lot of the time, it's catchy.

Samantha Speisman:
For sure. And I found that the more insecure my manager, the more they micromanaged, which is obviously a phrase and a trade that I don't think anybody enjoys in a work environment. But again, because there's that insecurity, it really becomes what can I do to again further my position, further my career, ensure that I have a future here. And by having a hand in anything that could be successful, that insecurity really comes through. In addition to making your team feel insecure, it takes away all the things that we just talked about as the best boss ever, which is that trust and freedom and room for growth because you're constantly having someone looking over your shoulder, making sure that they've put their stamp on whatever that project is. So that if it does prove to be successful, they can say that they were a part of it or it was their project.

Samantha Speisman:
One of the other things that I wanted to mention about Steph and why she really had such an impact on my career and one trait that I think is so important and that I continue to at least try to implement with my own team is she always gave her team credit for success. She wasn't ever someone to put up her hand and say, "That was my idea. I was involved in this." Obviously as a manager, she had a hand in anything that was successful. But even as an intern, if you had an idea or you had a story pitch and we went with it and it performed really well, she was the first person to say, "That was Sam's idea. She wrote it. It was wonderful." It didn't even matter if she had edited the whole thing and totally reworked it, and in the end it was like a fraction of what you had originally suggested. She always gave credit.

Samantha Speisman:
I think that that is one of the most important things you can do as a leader and as a best boss ever because it really gives you that confidence as a young employee to continue putting your ideas out there and continue taking risks because you know that if something works out, that you will be awarded or rewarded for it, which I think is really important.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it makes you want to work harder because you can't wait to get that recognition. It's literally the opposite of what insecurity does.

Samantha Speisman:
Totally.

Christine Laperriere:
So you can really see it again right there.

Samantha Speisman:
My experiences with my worst bosses ever, they would take credit for ideas or projects that perhaps weren't their idea. And I think that that's just such an example of the opposite ends of the spectrum and how one can can impact you positively and one can impact you so negatively.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And it's the difference between leadership and individual contribution. So if you're an individual contributor and you do great work and you want to promote your great work, that's fantastic. But when you move into a leadership position, you're responsible now for the work and the success of others and you're responsible for the culture and the mentality and the psychology of others. So, to me, that's exactly where the moment in time shifts where you no longer promote your own work. You promote the quality of the work that your team is delivering.

Samantha Speisman:
For sure. And I never understood the worst boss ever technique of taking credit because at the end of the day, if you're a leader and a manager and your team is successful, you are successful. A successful team reflects so positively on their leader. So the more success you can draw from your team members, the better you're going to look in the grand scheme. So although it's not selfish to give credit... In a way, it is kind of selfish because you're still going to come out looking like a rock star if your team's performing well, but your team's also going to feel like rock stars, which I think is the most important thing.

Christine Laperriere:
It's excellent. I really appreciate the angle or the lens that you're bringing to this because it just really hits the mark and so many situations that I can think of my own work experience, and just to be able to really show that difference between the way Stephania approached leadership and how that built you up versus that insecurity and that toxicity and how much that limited your growth. So I think, again, you can reflect back and see, "Wow, does that really make a difference?" It really stands out as night and day.

Samantha Speisman:
And I think the other thing that's really important to note is just how that experience with the worst boss ever, and there were a few, I won't say there was just one, there were a few, really shone a light on how Stephania was the best boss ever because that juxtaposition between that toxicity and that extreme trust showed me what kind of leader I wanted to be and how I could implement those lessons that she taught me at a very early stage of my career, and see how the toxicity with my worst bosses ever impacted me in such a negative way and make sure that moving forward as I built a team that I implemented all those lessons that she had taught me because I saw what an impact they could have long-term. I mean, it's been 13 years since I started working for her and I still remember how that job made me feel as a entry-level writer, publisher, editor, just the confidence and the freedom.

Samantha Speisman:
And the other thing, I think, that is important too, and I know work from home, we're all sick of it now because we've been doing it for however long, but Steph really bought into that idea long before it was trendy or it was widely accepted in the corporate world. She ensured that we took a day, a week to work from home. And really, again, it played into that idea of trust, but knowing that we were able to take that time and focus on our skills and not worry about meetings and commuting and all these things that often drain your creativity in a day so that we could really build on our skills. And as a result, I think that we all worked that much harder for the brand and her and the company and the results that she got out of us were so much stronger.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is amazing, right? So she has this green team and she's getting amazing results, and it's from this approach.

Samantha Speisman:
I didn't even, for the five years I worked there and granted I was green and new, but I never even considered working anywhere else because my happiness and my fulfillment in that role was so strong that I didn't even think about it. Every day was a joy. And I remember some of the more senior team members saying to me and some of my more junior colleagues, "This isn't normal. This doesn't happen all the time." But I think that that was really because of the environment that Stephania built and Joanna built, and really trying to create this place where we would all feel safe and could grow and could build that self-confidence that's so important for leaders in this age.

Christine Laperriere:
And just to bring that to close, my hope by shining a light on these best boss ever is that what if we said, "This is normal"? Imagine that. Imagine if you said, "Wow, I'm really happy and fulfilled and I don't want to go anywhere. I feel like I'm completely growing and I'm expanding." What if that was normal? And people said, "Oh, the insecure boss that you work for who's toxic, who's micromanaging you, that's not normal."

Christine Laperriere:
I think it's time for this paradigm shift. We're getting into flexible work which, by requirement, demands trust. And I mean, if you look, a lot of us are all saying like, "Put us into the gig economy," because at the end of the day, we want the freedom, right? We want that trust. We still want to grow. We still want to grow strong skills. We still want to work on high-performing teams. We still want to deliver results, but we're tired of being micromanaged and we're tired of the lack of trust and some of those things. So I just think it's a great way to close that. I want to encourage everybody to ask the question, when you are working for your best boss ever, what if everybody said, "Oh, and by the way, this is normal"?

Samantha Speisman:
I agree. I agree. I think that would be unbelievable. I try to foster with my team, and hopefully as they grow their careers, they'll go out and foster it with their own teams and we'll start a revolution.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. I love it. Thank you, Sam. That was fantastic to talk to you.

Samantha Speisman:
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you. And like I said, I hope everybody tunes in again so we can hear more about other people's best boss ever. Take care. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast

Title: Head, heart and guts
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Greg Hewitt

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So on today's show, I have Greg Hewitt coming on and I am so excited to have Greg here, because Greg and I worked together years ago. And I often reference Greg as being one of the best bosses ever that I've seen in action. So I personally, even though you weren't technically my boss, you were my top client. I got a chance to work for you and see what your inspired style of leadership did. I got to see the kind of culture you created, and I love to see how people love to follow you. And that was something that I really admired. So in honor of you being on my list of best bosses ever, I really wanted to invite you on the show and get a chance to ask you about your best bosses ever. So thank you, Greg.

Greg Hewitt:
Thanks, Christine. That's a really warm welcome, and hopefully I can live up to it in the stories that I'll tell about the leaders that inspired me and helped me become the leader I am today, and that I was when we worked together a few years back.

Christine Laperriere:
And you're currently CEO for DHL Express U.S. I should just mention that as well.

Greg Hewitt:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
So your career has advanced quite a bit in the years since we've worked together?

Greg Hewitt:
I guess so, but I'm one of those people that they talk about. There aren't many of us who are, I guess, are lifers. I joined the organization over 27 years ago, almost right out of university in 1993. And I'd been with, I was with a domestic company Loomis when I was recruited and we were acquired by DHL in around 2000. And I've been with the organization ever since in a number of capacities in Canada first for my formative years and then the U.S. and Europe. And yeah, I made the move down here after we'd worked together when I was the CEO in Canada for a number of years. I moved down here to the United States first into New York in a general management role. And then I've been in my role since the beginning of 2016.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm going to dive in, because the question that we all want to know is, who are your best bosses ever? I'd say best boss ever, but I know that for you there's more than one.

Greg Hewitt:
Yeah, I shared as we were coming on that I don't have just one. I have two leaders in mind who inspired me and helped me grow in different ways, and they're not dissimilar, but I think what I really think about with them is a little bit different. And those two gentlemen I'll talk about today are both DHLers, both long-term DHLers. One is Ken Allen, who's now the CEO for the DHL e-commerce solutions business in the DPE Group. But I worked for him first when I was the head of sales, marketing and customer service in Canada. And the second that I'll talk about as well is Mike Parra, who's my CEO for DHL in the Americas. And I've been working for him since I made the move from Canada back in 2014. And I think we all have a strong alignment in terms of values and beliefs that center us and allow us to work well together and see commonality in our approach.

Greg Hewitt:
Can I always relate back to really helping me evolve? We talk a lot at DHL and I think it's pretty common practice around leadership attributes to think about head, heart and guts. Those are, you hear those terms. And we've got attributes we assign to them can really help me a lot with my head attributes and probably a bit on the guts. Mike has really inspired me and help me build out my heart leadership attributes and the guts ones as well. So that's why I thought it'd be, if you'll allow me to share stories of both and how that's helped for me and to improve all three of those areas.

Christine Laperriere:
You've got my attention. So tell me, how do you, first of all, let's start with Ken. I had the luxury of working with him too and have incredible admiration for him. So do tell me a little bit more about how he helped you with building up that kind of head capacity of leadership?

Greg Hewitt:
Ken's a funny guy, because he would always say there's only one strategist in the company and it was him. You didn't need to be a strategist in your function, your area, your country. He led the strategy. He allowed us to help with that and build it out. But that's, he taught me a lot about really thinking through strategy and what is it that as a business you do really well and that you can excel at and that you should focus on to kind of, as the expression goes, to turn something that's good in to something that's great. And so he was a big believer in the profit service value chain and came up with our focus strategy, which was that motivated people will deliver great service quality that'll build loyalty in your customers and lead to a profitable network.

Greg Hewitt:
And that value chain, he really tried to simplify it and helped me and have helped our organization as a whole. He's written a book called Radical Simplicity. It really was about, if you motivate, get and keep your people and you make them happy and you invest in them and you empower them, they really are going to have a focus on delivering exceptional service quality. And in our business, which is a service business, if our people give exceptional service quality and really put the customer, their heart and care about it, chances are your customers will feel that. They'll know that you care about them and you won't give them a chance to leave.

Greg Hewitt:
I'll jump around a bit. But I'll never forget when he asked me, I was trying to explain, he was new in the CEO role and we had a real issue. I call it a leaky bucket challenge, right? Where I was talking about what a great job we were doing in sales. "Look at all this acquisition, all these new customers we were bringing on, but the revenue wasn't really growing that fast." And he looked at me and he said, "What if we just kept the ones we had?" He said, "It seems to me like you're losing more business then you can possibly bring on. But what if we refocused our energy?" And I said, "Ken, you just don't understand. We make mistakes in this business. We're not perfect. You're never going to keep them all, it's really competitive."

Greg Hewitt:
And then he challenged me, said, "Who do you bank with?" And at the time I was like, "Okay, I bank with the Royal Bank of Canada, RBC." And he said, "How long have you been with the bank?" And I sat back and I said, "Well, I think since my dad, when I had a paper, took me over as a kid and I opened a savings account." And he goes, "Exactly, why have you never left the bank?" And I go, "I don't know." He goes, "Has your life changed over the years?" And of course I'd grown up, gone to university, I had to have a bank account for that to pay for things. I'd worked, started working, bought homes. "Because every time you had an issue," he said, "they were there to help you. And they cared about you and they gave you no reason to leave." So he totally shook my foundation on, well, how we should view a customer and look at service. And he said, "I just want you to focus all your energy on our existing customers by understanding what we're doing wrong and why they're leaving and how we can fix it."

Greg Hewitt:
And the slant to that was back to, I bet you it's that we've got people that aren't caring or don't understand what they need to do, but let's just fix it. And it was to me a radical strategy. What if when I said, "You cannot open another new account. You cannot bring on a new customer till you fix why we're losing customers." So when we said that and I told the sales force this and we talked about it in our regional meetings with the team from the U.S. and the team from Mexico, people thought we were crazy. But sure enough, six months into that strategy where I could not open a new account, amazingly our growth rates were higher than when we were acquiring all that new business. And of course, he saw it further down the road. Once you fix the problem and you were really focused on measuring what the problems were, the issues and getting the service right, then you can reopen bringing on new customers and your growth rate accelerates even faster.

Greg Hewitt:
And that's just one example of him as a strategist, challenging the status quo, being brave enough to make decisions that most people would not take. And to think about a problem in a different way, to not just do what you've always done. And so sometimes that will come from his brain or your own brain. But the other side to it is you have to be open to new ideas, different ideas, different approaches. And that another thing Ken was very good at was making sure he was willing to listen to anyone and everyone, and to hear where the problems are, what the issues are, and then would put the resources on to tackle it. As a strategist, really embraced talking to the business at all levels. We talk about spending 70% of your time on the floor and in the field. Ken was never afraid to walk the dog, talk to the couriers, talk to the front clerks who work our front counters, talk to the sales people.

Greg Hewitt:
He didn't confine himself to an ivory tower. He didn't just value the opinions of his executive team or his peer group. He really valued listening to everyone. He told me one of the things that he liked about me was the first day he came in on the job and he was going around. He came to my office and we sat down for 30 minutes and he asked me for a state of the business from a field sales and national account and marketing standpoint. And I gave him my lay of the land. Here's what's working, here's what's, there weren't a lot working, but here's what's not working, what we need to do. Took that and he said, "Okay, now I want to just, I want to get a feel for the team and okay, so where am I going?"

Greg Hewitt:
And I said, "Well, I'm going to hand you off to Andrew Williams. He's my director of field sales and he'll get it started. But in this office you've got field sales, tele sales, national accounts, marketing, just about everybody in here. And I think I'm just going to have them hand you off. And I want you to spend the morning getting to know the business."

Greg Hewitt:
And he stopped me and he said, "You mean, you're not coming with me. Well, if you want me to hold your hand, I'll gladly walk around with you." And he said, "No, no, no, I don't want them, but why do you feel you don't need to come with me?" And I said, "I know this team, I trust this team. I know that anything they tell you will be relevant for you. And there may be things that I don't know like that I'm not seeing that you might see, but in general there's nothing they can tell you that I don't know, or that I'm embarrassed by, ashamed by, or worried about. So I'd rather you hear it direct from them and not have anybody feel like they've got to hold back because I'm standing over your children."

Greg Hewitt:
And he's, "Okay." And he went off and he came back and he shared with me that he'd been doing this in every function in every area. And he was pleased that I was as connected and open with the front line as he expected his leaders to be. And that I was confident enough that he could go and ask anyone anything. And I wasn't afraid, ashamed, embarrassed, or felt the need to control and to wrap. And he said, that said a lot because other people were kind of controlling who he could see. And they didn't get that eventually he's going to find it all out anyways. But that was a bit of what he taught me, the value of getting in front of everyone and being open to the answers.

Greg Hewitt:
And you know this, a company you work for helped me see it as well. That all the answers you need are here in your business. It's not somewhere else, it's not outside. If you're open and you listen, you'll get enough data points and enough information to kind of center in on where the right answers are to solve problems. So for me, a big part of what he taught me was the importance of being out in the business, connecting to my team at all levels. He reinforced something that I think was in me and was very natural, but that was important to me. That's another one of the things that he taught me. He really helped me see that you have to assess, you have to understand how big the problem is, and you can't be afraid to take dramatic action to really make a difference and get to a point where you're level and you can grow from that.

Greg Hewitt:
And that meant doing things like radically changing org structure and cutting a number of layers of management out, that as well, when I talk about learning, I love that he felt confident enough in me that as a new CEO in Canada, with a finance background, he said, "I'm not going to replace the CFO. We don't need a CFO. I know how to be a CFO." But he said, "What I do need is it's probably too much for me to have all of the responsibilities. So there are a couple of finance functions, namely billing and credit and collections that would go to the CFO. Well, I want you to take it. So I want you to be my senior vice president customer. And so that means any customer touchpoint, all of sales, all of marketing, all of customer service, all what we now call order to cash, billing, credit, and collections. I want you to own it all. And you own the whole customer life cycle."

Greg Hewitt:
Gave me a different perspective. It gave me new experiences. It built out my breadth and experience. And that's a hallmark for him. He'd make difficult decisions. He would be willing to do more with less, but he was also always willing to take a chance. And he didn't have to have all the experience in the world to justify getting, being put a role or trying something else. He gave me opportunities to do things that others had not, and to prove myself. And I think that he taught me the importance of that. Sometimes by beating it over my head by saying, "Why are you thinking about this when you should give this young person a chance? Or this person who works for us, but might be two levels down, let them climb up. Why are you going outside and bringing someone in, give him a chance, Greg." He was very good at that at seeing the best in us and in doing so.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is an amazing story. And then, it's funny. I'll just mention this, that when I think of my experience of Ken Allen, I remember I was only 28 years old, I think at the point that I was leading up those restructuring projects. And I do remember going into a meeting with him and he was so interested in my point of view. And I was so intimidated because I wasn't used to anybody with that much authority being genuinely interested, but not because he was trying to hang me out to dry. He was genuinely interested because he believed I had value to add. And that actually was almost disorienting for me at the point in which I had that meeting with him because I thought, "I'm just not used to people being genuinely that interested in my point of view, I'm early in my career." So now I'm so curious. Can you tell us if Ken was that earlier in your career, what is Mike like now today?

Greg Hewitt:
To me, Mike, he just brings a level of heart, a genuine passion and love for people. The empathy and a understanding the emotional quotient, the high EQ of just connecting with people and genuinely wanting everyone to succeed and to do well. And again, very similar, where Ken would walk around and meet everyone for their point of view and their opinion, Mike's ability to connect on a personal level and at all levels. And I've watched him do this from Santiago, Chile, through Vancouver, Canada at every stop in between he develops that relationship. And it's so genuine from I'll watch him with the cleaning crew at our Miami-based station, which is close to his home that sometimes he works at, is the same level of respect and discussion as he would have with myself or a colleague in the boardroom. He just genuinely loves people, cares about people, really believes that the work that we're doing and we talk about with our heart, having a purpose of DHL, we say it, "Connecting people and improving lives."

Greg Hewitt:
And what I challenge my team and Mike does a bit the same is, you have to find more than just your job or the career. It's what is our purpose? And for, we've used phrases like, "Every package has a story." And challenging everyone from a courier to a CS agent, to an executive to say, "What is that story? That interaction you've had with a customer or an employee or something that connects at a higher level?" He just does that each and every day. And he makes me feel special. He makes me feel valued. I know that when I sit down and talk about my career or, but whether it's personal or professional, a tremendous level of trust, because I know that in his heart he wants me to be happy. He wants me to excel. He's not afraid, and I, this is where I ... This isn't someone who isn't prepared to be tough on you, challenge you, demand great results.

Greg Hewitt:
It's just someone that in his core, I know that everything that he's doing comes with positive intent for everyone. And that he does not have in him any bone of disingenuine politics. There's no angle that he's playing. Everything he's trying to do is, I liken it, I talk about, there are people in this world who walk around trying to kick the podium out from under people who are doing well, drag them down to their level. And there are people that spend their entire life trying to drag people up on the podium with them. I've tried very hard. I think Mike is one of the greatest ambassadors to trying to get everybody up on the stage with him, to share in that success, to share in the happiness that he has. And for me I try to role model myself with those same values that I always assume positive intent.

Greg Hewitt:
I always try my best to stop. And he's helped me a lot with my listening skills and to not just respond, to respond, but to really try to listen and walk a mile in the other person's shoes. And think about and understand what it is that they need and want, and has really helped me embrace helping develop my team and at least the level below by focusing on employee development reviews, consistent individual performance plans that have really strong development goals that either will help a skillset, a capability or a leadership attribute that genuinely will help improve me as a person and help my career. He really helped me bring focus to that and commit time and energy to it. And I feel that that's part of what's making my team better and stronger. He helped me understand that what had gotten me to being the GM in New York, and wasn't what was going to make me successful in this next role. That I was now going to be leading people who had as strong a resume, as smart as me as talented as me as much.

Greg Hewitt:
And he said, "You're going to have to learn what motivates them, what excites them and get them to buy in and trust that you care as much as they do about their success. And if you're able to do that, you'll unlock tremendous potential." And I think he has a tremendous self-awareness that I recognize in myself and try to have. This ability to be ruthlessly honest with yourself, to understand what your strengths are, to understand what your opportunities are. And in today's day and age is where the difficult situations around diversity, equality and inclusiveness, recognizing some of our unconscious bias and recognizing that even when we're really good people at harp, we have biases and we might not always be right. We might have blinders on. We might not see things, he's helped me and embraces this idea of, we need to make sure we get as many viewpoints around us to help us make decisions.

Greg Hewitt:
Because even though we make a lot of good ones, there may be things that we miss. And so, he's really helped me by showing a willingness to surround himself with good people and diverse with a diverse background, to make sure that we're making the best decisions. And so that's where I think if Ken was more for me about focusing on clear priorities, measuring and driving and delivering great results, understanding how to leverage strengths and strengths of people to move the business forward, Mike has really helped me with finding and speaking to my purpose and the purpose of the business. Building trust, not only within my team, but with customers, and then trying to work through this idea of remaining positive and strong and stable and calm in a changing world, which is the sign of a good leader or as a hallmark of a good leader is being able to stay positive, to be able to be that calm voice.

Greg Hewitt:
As much as you can, you can't change, I don't think you can completely change your personality. I'm emotional, I'm fiery, that's part of my passion. But to find a way to use that in a really positive way, he's really helped those. And so when I look at all those attributes together, those are some of the things that they both helped shape and round me. And I looked to, what would Ken do? Or what would Mike do in different scenarios to say, "That's my compass and a guiding light on decisions I would make and the way I've structured it."

Christine Laperriere:
It sounds like an incredibly well rounded education you got from the two leaders that you got an opportunity to see in action and be up close to. So then I just have to ask you maybe the really quick thoughts on, we talked about this. Sometimes you learn the most from the leaders that don't classify as the best boss ever, any big lessons that you want to share there?

Greg Hewitt:
Yeah, I have an individual and I think the best way is I've modelled myself on not saying bad about anyone. So I'll keep them as the anonymous source. When we went through a reorg at the organization, I had a leader that I think the job was too much for him. I always chalk it up to, I tried and gone back to understand the why, and I think the scope of what he was being asked to do, it was just too much. And part of that goes back to when I look at him is he was very good with the sizzle. There wasn't a lot of steak. I think he'd spent so much of his career positioning himself, looking right, saying the right things, managing up, that he forgot that at one point it would come to roost because if you don't really understand the business and get into the details and genuinely care about everyone, that the big size business you can't skate forever.

Greg Hewitt:
And I think this individual did a great job. And in some ways he was brilliant, in front of a customer, in front of an audience, scripted. He was a great order, a good communicator, and he looked the part, but there wasn't the depth. And that meant at times he wasn't able to make the difficult decisions. He didn't trust himself. And so the biggest mistake that I think he made was that he didn't make any decisions. He didn't, when two companies came together, he didn't choose a path of A or B. He just kept blending it together. I remember being almost a year into the restructure. And his answer was to go to, I call it the famous offsite of, and this is the February Ken talks about. Instead of, when we should have been looking and saying, "Why did we lose $11 million," we flew off to New Orleans to have a retreat and discuss it with a facilitator from KPMG.

Greg Hewitt:
And I remember it was not going well. It was all going sideways. And he got very angry with me when I was sharing some, "Here's some things you got to stop doing." And I remember I just kind of ended it and said, "Listen, this is irresponsible what we're doing. The number one thing you could do, the only way you can justify what we're all doing down here is if you come back with half of us. So what I would do before this meeting is over in the next two days is I'd fire half of us. Then when you go back, you'll have credibility because at least you will have gone and made a decision. Now, the way you're yelling at me, I'm going to go write my name on the board, because I'm pretty sure I'm not the guy you're going to pick for this one. So I'm going to put Anthony's name up here and my name-"

Christine Laperriere:
I'm on the fired list.

Greg Hewitt:
"Now you don't." And I said, "And you've got all mad at me. What are you talking about?" This is, and he's yelling at me. And I pulled out the book and I asked him, "Have you even read this?" And I probably used a couple of explicits at that point. And I said, "Have you even read this F-ing book?" And he's looking at me, "Of course I have." And I said, "Well, let me go. Chapter one. Well, you didn't do that. Chapter two, didn't do that. Chapter." And I threw it on the table and I said, "You didn't even follow the one book you handed us as your charter, your what we're going to do. You never followed one of. So I'm going back to one, make a decision, fire half of us." Now, looking back, I'm pretty lucky as he didn't fire me, he didn't take my advice.

Christine Laperriere:
It was a gutsy move.

Greg Hewitt:
About a month later, and I tie this back to what I've learned, I was lucky enough to meet Ken Allen who was brought into be his successor and run Canada. And for me, I'd learned a lot in what not to do. And Ken would often tell me, "A great leader," the biggest thing, and this is this focusing on clear priorities and being results-driven, "A great leader doesn't tell you what you should do or you could do, a great leader helps people understand what not to do. Because if you understand what not to do and you stay focused on the other things, the odds are you'll be successful."

Greg Hewitt:
As he would say to me, "Greg, you can sit there and tell me, you guys started a lot of great ideas, you just never finished any of them. So why don't we start by doing less, but let's finish them. And then maybe we can look at the next thing." So, to me that's, the guy I learned from was, I really felt you need to understand your business to get into the details. And I get feedback quite often now as a CEO, that when I meet with my functional teams for their quarterly updates, or I do a voice sub session, they come back to me and say, they're always amazed at how much of the detail I know. And I'm like, "Well, I really do listen. I work closely with your, I give credit because my leaders are amazing in all my functions and areas. But I do really pride myself on trying to understand that detail, because I think it's important to make informed decisions." And I learned that from Ken.

Christine Laperriere:
There's always a debate about investing in leaders to help them become the best bosses ever. What is the impact to the bottom line of that, right? You would know that, there's that moment where it's like, is it worth spend ending X? Because these results sometimes are subjective, right? It's their culture. They're how you feel when you go to work. Any quick thoughts if somebody was contemplating investing in their people, in their organization, what would you tell them?

Greg Hewitt:
It's a must. This is a great wrap to go back to the first CEO that I spoke to, which is Ken Allen. Other than the big decision to get out of the domestic business, which was brave and cut losses, the second biggest decision he made was to create something called the certified program. He called it the Certified International Specialist program. And it was a learning and development curriculum that everyone from a courier and frontline, accounts receivable clerk, CS all the way up to him as the CEO, everybody took those courses. Those welcome to my country. Welcome to my function. Welcome to my company, so that we could develop a common language across 220 countries and territories around the world. We've continued to invest in that program. It just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

Greg Hewitt:
And I would say when people ask me about what was the single biggest chain agent of change of a piece of change that went on for DHL, the introduction of that certified program, which later developed the certified international supervisory academy for supervisors who manage most of your frontline, the certified international manager program, that created that our culture. That taught us the behaviors. That taught us about our leadership attributes and that is what guides us.

Greg Hewitt:
And it meant that in a business that was doing well and growing it also in a lot of the early years, particularly when we developed the Certified International Manager program that we facilitate, we work with an external company NKD to build the content, but it was facilitated by DHLers or DHLers. There were a lot of leaders who were considered really strong people because of the results they produced, but when they didn't have the balance between results and respect that we saw as 21st century leadership attributes, that program helped us make decisions that people who may have been putting up good numbers still needed to go. And it allowed us to build and foster a culture that struck balance and allowed us to continue to grow. And I don't think any of us, the millions that we've invested in it, nobody, and continue to invest year in and year out, nobody has challenged or questioned how much that's brought to the bottom line.

Greg Hewitt:
In fact, one of the big fears we've had this year with the pandemic is because so much of it is done face-to-face, we haven't been able to do it with the same, I guess, velocity that we had before. And we're about to launch some of the modules and refreshers in a virtual environment and adapt them. But we know how important it is to get everyone healthy so we can get back to investing in it, graduating more supervisors from our academy. They talk about, nothing could be more important than when your son or daughter graduates from college if you knew their first job, they were going to go work for a supervisor who'd been given the skills to really coach them, to mentor them, to give them good direction. And who understood the balance between respect-based behaviors and results-based behaviors and could help set them on a great path for their career.

Greg Hewitt:
So anyone who's considering it, you can't spend enough. You have to find the right fit for your organization and not everyone can build it from the ground up. Not everyone has that luxury. So find an outlet, find course, find an individual that you believe in that you think can motivate you and your team. But to only sharpen your skills, your tactical, what I think of as more tactical skills, language skills, mathematical skills, selling skills, and ignore leadership attributes, is a mistake. I always say, our people when we're talking about them and seeing who are the next me's, the next people to sit in my chair were looking at both objectively their skills, their experience, their results, but equally their behaviors that are linked to their leadership attributes and saying, "Do they have strong in all those head, heart and guts attributes that we can work with and that we believe are the future leaders?" And if they aren't, how do we get them to help either within our own programs or through external coaches and systems that might help them develop and grow?

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you, Greg. That was a fantastic discussion and I really, really appreciate it. I'm sure people are going to enjoy listening and putting some of these things into practice. So again, thank you so much. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Title: You're driving too fast
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Hello, Demetria and thank you for being on the Best Boss Ever podcast with me today. I am so thrilled to have you here.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Good morning, Christine. I'm so excited to be a part of this with you, and to be able to have some dialogue around a very important topic with you.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. And just as we get started, I love to explain why I invite each person on the show. I've had the luxury of working with you for the past four years. And what I really admire about you, is how you have made a commitment to advancing, diverse women, in leadership, in the field that you're in, and I've just seen you take action on it, and create real lasting change. So, you're one of the leaders that I really look up to and hope to be like when I grow up.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Thanks to that compliment. Looking back, I'm a senior vice president now, of financial crimes at Scotiabank. And throughout my career, when I was looking up, I didn't see many women, and I didn't see many people who looked like me. So I didn't really have the luxury of a lot of help and support. And when I look at women in the industry today, and financial services, I feel like it's important for us to impart that information, let's help each other. Let's raise each other up, because that's the only way that we're going to get more women into leadership roles.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And like I said, it's been just a pleasure watching you put this to action, because you're making real change. And so, it's amazing, I get to see it. Do you have anything else you want to share about your introduction before we get started?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
No. I think from my background, you know who I am and what we do and I'm committed to inclusion and diversity, but, really creating a space for women to thrive.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. I'm just going to dive right in. Tell us about your best boss ever.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So when you, asked me this question, the thing that comes to me, or comes to mind, is the character traits that I've thought about. And I've haven't had one best boss. I've had best bosses throughout my career, and there are things I've liked about them. And I think the traits that I most, have enjoyed. One is that they are truly authentic individuals. And by that, I mean, they're so down to earth, despite their title, you never feel like you're speaking to somebody that you should be afraid of, or shouldn't show your true colors to. They're very genuine, in both your personal and professional development. And you'll notice that they operate that way, both in the office and out of the office because, truly, the individuals that I've interacted with who, I still know, and I would very much, go work for them in a heartbeat. Because they really left a strong impression on me, around. They cared about me as a person and had a vested interest in me.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
They offered me trust, right from the very get go. So they considered me a subject matter expert. They considered me someone who could do the job, whatever job or role or function I had, they didn't question me. They simply asked me to start doing things, whether that was, put a 90 day plan together, or hire up a team, or execute on a strategy, they immediately left me with, your cup is full. And I'm not, having to let you validate yourself for me to trust you. They right off the bat wanted you to shine. And then I think, the last trait I would say that was, obviously very... Or left a good impression on me was, they were situational with me, in that, if I needed how up and support they were there, I could ask questions openly, and I never felt it was a dumb question.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
I could ask questions around their style. Like how do they want me to interact with them, or a specific meeting. They allowed me to ask about the audience, the person. What things am I walking into that maybe nobody else would know? And, they didn't make me feel or give me the impression that, I was a failure because I was asking, it was more of, how can I help you to succeed? And when I really did do stuff that, was probably offsite or they felt could have been done better, even in their feedback, in their constructive feedback, to me, they never made me feel small, or a person who was invalid because of that one situation. So when I think again about the characteristics of the great bosses that I've had, it's absolutely authenticity, trust and, driving the situation each and every time, as a unique opportunity. And for me, those are the traits that when I think of a great boss, those are the ones that sort of last in my mind.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. And I love that at list. Can I ask you to give some detailed examples? I'd love to hear. Walk me into a room where you're getting feedback from one of these bosses that has, some of these great characteristics. What does that look like? So you just did something that, could have been done better. They're giving that feedback to you, in a way that doesn't disengage you. Tell me, what does that look like?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
I think a lot of women probably get the same feedback around. They were either too aggressive or at some point, or too assertive. There probably isn't a woman that I don't know of that hasn't been told that. And so I've been given that same feedback at some point, but, with those individuals who gave me that feedback, they offered first and foremost, the opportunity for me, to impart what I think happened in the meeting, how I saw it, and what I thought occurred. And then what they shared was, their feedback. And their feedback wasn't negative. They simply offered, their observations and perspectives. And so in that situation, they said, when you came forward and provided your opinion, at that executive steer core, it felt like, you were to trying to drive to a conclusion, without allowing the audience the time, to absorb the recommendation.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So you were driving a little too fast, versus allowing the audience to say, "Okay, let's pause on that recommendation, and allow that executive team now to own that decision, versus you felt like you were trying to drive it within seconds." And that actually made me stop and think, and I thought, gee you're right. And what was going on in my head was, typically these meetings, aren't more than 30 minutes. So, I'm such a driver, but I'm also very aware of the time, and the clock ticking. And I want to get to the end of the meeting, and I want to complete the meeting and its totality. And sometimes, you have to recognize, that it may take longer than one meeting, even if the outcome was you needed that decision today, you may have to drive in that meeting that, if we don't drive to this decision today, here's what's going to happen in the next two weeks. Are we okay with that?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
That really allowed me, to kind of step back for myself and go, oh my God, I did do that. Oh, and I see that now in a different light, they gave me that feedback, or that person did. And it certainly didn't come across negative, but it gave me such a perspective into my own behavior, that it was like a light bulb. And I was so aware of it, that every other meeting that I was going into, I was now cognizant of, I've been doing the work, driving the work, but the recommendation is for them to rally around, is for the them to own. And so, if they need a bit more time, absolutely I can drive the figures, the facts, the information, and that is going to help them drive the decision. And that's what I need them to own, is the risk or the decision or the issue. And that was such a light bulb moment for me, it was an aha moment, but it really did change the course of how I behaved in certain types of meetings and or how I even behaved with my own team.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that story. And it's such a good example because, what I notice is, some of the best bosses, first of all, give real feedback, not just, "Oh, you're doing great. Don't worry about it." And then all of a sudden, at the end of the year, you get stuck with this surprise performance review, right? But then, sometimes I'll hear these stories where people are given, feedback that feels unfair or difficult or hard to hear, and it's very disengaging. And so you take these very high potential people, and you demotivate them along the path, and then they become scared or they fear operated. And that doesn't make any of us perform better. So, I love this example where you said, you got to share your observation of what you saw happen. They got to talk about their observation of what they saw happen. And then, you were really able to take that feedback, as a giant aha moment, because, what your intention was, and how you were being received were two different things.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
And it wasn't even delivered in such a way where you felt, that you were being scolded. Like it was more, can I offer you this observation? Here's what really needs to happen, is these people need to own the decision yet you're driving it. So, give it time to breathe. And then that was me just understanding that, hey, it's not about me in that moment, driving to the decision or the time, trying to get to the end of the meeting, get the job done. It's really about them. So how do I help them get over? And that just completely changed my own perspective.

Christine Laperriere:
When you think of... First of all, can you tell us what are some of the characteristics of the not best boss that you've seen in your own career? Well, words of wisdom for people listening.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
I'd say it's sort of the opposite of the characteristics that I talked about. So one is, individuals who are passive aggressive, which, to me really reflects, I'm nice to you in person, but then behind the scenes, I'm operating in a way that feels deliberately intentional or disrespectful of you. And, and that shows up in many different forms, whether, that's bullying tendencies, or in authenticity. So, like they're just to get you to get to the answer that they want to hear and start to be done with. And I also think it's micromanagement. I've never been good at being micromanaged. I am very much a person who likes to drive my day, my outcome, my team. And so when, that's all sort of blocked in, if you will, it doesn't feel empowering or very freeing or the ability to generate creativity and sort of be yourself.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So when I think of those traits, those are the characteristics that... And you can see it very quickly. You have to think, I'm in this role, I'm observing it. What am I learning from this moment? I'm a firm believer that things keep coming to you until you learn how to deal with them. It's also your time to learn about yourself, whether that's tolerance, whether that's the ability to respond in a respectful way, you don't want to be the individual, you don't like the characteristics of. But you still learn something from it. And in that period, you're also deciding, is this the job role or career that I want? The reality is, sometimes you're given those messages through people, to really help drive. What excites you, what makes you passionate every day and makes you want to come to work and be your best authentic self.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Sometimes it's those things, that trigger the change. Nothing else COVID has shown us, is the opportunity to be reflective internally, about just how much we can take as people, and how much we need each other to be successful.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I like what you're saying too, because it's funny how, working for the not best boss sometimes can... It creates a choice. Like, you have this moment where you can either mirror the same behavior back. So I know I get into a lot of conversations with clients where the instinct is, for example, passive aggressive or micromanagement, all of a sudden they start to become, passive aggressive or micromanagement. And I always say, this is what culture looks like. People don't understand what culture is. I'm like, culture is this intangible thing, but it's, we all mirror each other, in a way. So, to your point, you have this opportunity where you can either behave like that person or you can become much more rooted in your values and make a much stronger effort to not be those things.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Yeah. Have you ever been in a meeting where just everybody's trying to talk on top of each other and, create a point or be heard? And I'm always one of those individuals in the meeting where, honestly, if I have a point to state, I'll either raise my hand through the team's meetings nowadays, or wait until there's a pause. But, to say that I have to say something in that meeting, because I feel like the behavior has to be mirrored, used to be a point in time where I felt that pressure, and now I feel like, no, that's not me. I'm going to speak when it's relevant. When I have something to say, when it's important for me to state something. And if someone's already stated the same thing, and me just trying to do it in a different way to be heard, it's not a good use of my time. So it's almost like that, I don't want to mirror behaviors or mirror somebody else's approach, because it's the expected norm. I want to be me.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's that holding onto authenticity, right? One of the questions that I always get is, how good or bad leadership actually impacts the bottom line? I think a lot of people say, this intangible leadership stuff, it really doesn't show up. Let's invest in sales training, maybe we can see it in revenue, but when it comes to leadership and soft skills, a lot of people debate what the actual impact is. If you can think of, maybe the difference between your best bosses and you're not best bosses, what's the impact to the bottom line that you've seen?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So there is personal and I think professional impact, and I do believe it's tangible, but we just haven't found ways to effectively measure it. I have been in roles where, I'm beyond excited to get up in the morning. I show up happy. I show up where I need to go. I've got more ideas than I can deal with. I am excited to, move the company forward and, it's observed by, I would say different things that, we don't generally measure because, once you get to a senior leadership position, whether you are a manager, director, whether you're a VP, people stopped looking at the time that you put into the company. It's just the expected norm. But I've worked 80 hours a week. And that would be the standard I would, work weekends and it didn't feel like I was working. Like I could still do more, so much so that, my days fly by, I'm working with my team.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
We're, working through ideas, or different things. And we're producing things I'm taking on extra work. So I'm asking for extra work, and not intentional to prove something. I'm just like, I'm so excited and this connects to X. Oh, okay. Can I take that on? So it shows up by the virtue of the fact that, because you're excited and happy and you're finding different ways to contribute. You're getting not just your work done, but you're doing additional work. And I've had one of my bosses tell me this. Like I just don't know where you get all this energy to do this. And you're often doing things that don't even belong to you. Whether it's a deck, whether it's a presentation, whether it's an analysis, you're like, "Okay, this person hasn't done it yet. Or that team hasn't gotten there. Let me start for them."

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Doesn't mean that you've finished it all that you've gone ahead because, you're just so driven that you want to do the work. And I think, you just see that helping others, asking for more work, being open to ideas, being open to collaborating, those are all the intangibles that we can't effectively measure. The only thing that most companies measure is over time, but that's just one indicator. And frankly, a lot of us don't even track overtime anymore. We don't even bother, logging it because there's an expected perception that, there is no nine to five anymore. So if you think about an employee who demonstrates those traits, then you know, there's a positive impact to the bottom line. And you don't have to be in a revenue generating line of business, to see it because, all of us contribute, whether it's a back office, whether it's sales, whether it's operations, whether it's technology, we all have something to contribute to the organization. We just do it differently. So when I think of productivity impacts, absolutely, they're real. They just don't show up, in a way that is easily measured sometimes.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly what I see. I just see the productivity and also the creativity. So the way you solve problems, when you're in a good state of mind and you feel valued, your ability to access more creative thinking is so much more. It's available, it's just like you said, when you show up and you're in a great mood and you're like, I can't wait to see what happens. And then you throw seven different ideas of how to solve a problem on the table. You can really see those things, but, when you're scared of a boss or you're worried that it's going to cause more work, or if you open your mouth, you're going to be seen as stupid or it's going to hurt your reputation, we stop creative thinking.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Think of ourselves as individuals, right? When we're open, there's just so much more that you're willing to receive. And yet if you're in a negative space, whether it's because you're afraid of your job, you're afraid of your boss, or maybe there's even a personal situation that you're dealing with. And there's just so much additional pressure, your ability to think, gets snared. It could be the smallest of things. I recently had a back injury, that injury truly had me not being able to roll out of bed. My ability to lead my team or think through, when I'm physically feeling pain, is that much more limited. And I have to rely on my team to do more. And that's just a physical injury. Imagine emotional injuries, that we are feeling, that are constant, right? You're going from, I think the average is, 11 to 15 different conversations in a day. And so contextually, it's not the same person. It's not the same emotion or the same feeling in every single meeting. And it's just building and building and it's like a pressure cooker, right? It's just boiling over. It's waiting to boil over.

Christine Laperriere:
This has been fantastic. If you have any words of wisdom, to leave everybody with, I'm going to ask you to share those. And especially given the fact, as we talked, as we were kind of, pre-interviewing, how challenging COVID is right now for the average professional who is home, and it's now been over a year and, some are parents and trying to juggle children. Do you have any really great words of wisdom for us?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Well, I would say that there is no one answer to this, right? And we're all different. And so to respect everybody's individuality. So, for moms who are at home, who have children and are trying to deal with that, online learning, or just the fact that there are so many assignments, give them the freedom to do so. And again, they will, in productivity wise, be tenfold. If there are, are people that are struggling mentally, offer them venues, whether it's through your work or, being an empathetic person or just listening, because sometimes people just need to be heard. For me, it's been exercise. COVID as much as it's been the thing that has pushed us home and, pushed relationships back and had us all online, it really has made me think about my personal wellbeing, whether it's my relationship, whether it's my relationship with food or physical activity.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
When we were in the office, I was leaving home at 6:30 in the morning and not getting back until seven. And let's be honest. I was exhausted. There wasn't a lot of physical activity happening during the week. For the most part, I'd go right back online, and my activity would be on the weekends. And now I've really felt that my integration, is about me understanding what is more important to me. So again, returning to my authentic self, what am I willing to absorb? And what am I not willing to sacrifice it? Again, it's not necessarily the same every day. There are days. This morning I was out at six o'clock for a walk, because I know my day is full. But that's important to me. So I'm up and I'm not commuting anymore. I'm doing that. So, I think for each person, you really need to think about what's important, stay true to yourself, whatever that might show up, like, maybe it is having the courage to speak in meetings.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Maybe it is exercise as, maybe it's being intentional with your children now that you are at home and you have this time together, which we may never get back, who knows what our new normal will be, making sure that you are making decisions at the end of the day, that will lead you to be happy in your career, your job, your next role, whatever that might be. And in the moment we are all struggling, how do you help each other? Because that's what you can do as well. And, sometimes when you connect with someone who has the same thing going on, you don't feel alone and you're not alone. And the mere fact that you can share an experience, have a conversation, can very well carry you through. And, I think a lot of us do feel alone right now. So those would be my little tidbits of wisdom, if you will, that have helped me come through this.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
And I think we are still a long way to go. And each day, I really do try and get up and sort of wash the previous day off, and start with a fresh attitude, a fresh perspective, and really try to go into it with, today's a good day.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much, Demetria. That was amazing. And I really appreciate every minute I get to talk to you and learn from you. Thank you so much.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Always a pleasure talking to you.

Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Sharon Giraudel

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. Sharon, welcome so much to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. And thank you so much for coming on the show.

Sharon Giraudel:
Thank you for having me.

Christine Laperriere:
Please introduce yourself.

Sharon Giraudel:
My name is Sharon Giraudel. I'm the Director of Human Resources at a mining company. I have kind of an interesting background in that I've worked in financial services, consumer packaged goods, and more recently the mining industry for the last nine years.

Christine Laperriere:
I have to say, the reason I had to have you on the show is I had the opportunity to work with you in the mining industry years ago even, to help with the advancement of women. We just had so much fun working together. I loved your insight, also the lightheartedness that you've brought to the conversation as well. So I really appreciate having the opportunity to work with you.

Sharon Giraudel:
Great. Yes. And we really enjoyed it as well. And I'm looking forward to working with you in my new role later on this year as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Let's just dive right in. Tell me a little bit about your best boss ever.

Sharon Giraudel:
Well, I'd have to say my first boss was an HR leader that I worked with about 15 years ago. And what I really liked about her was that she provided clear direction, empowered her team, and just created an environment where she really allowed us to be ourselves. The other thing that I really loved about her was she had the most infectious laugh, the type of laugh that actually would travel down the hallway, up and down the stairs, and right back all around. I'll never forget that we had a new VP that joined the company. And one of the first things he said to her was, "You laugh a lot." And her response was, I'll never forget it, "Yeah, I do. So get used to it."

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yes. It was just so awesome, and I'll never forget that. We worked so hard, but we had a lot of fun. The other thing that I really liked about her was she really helped our department transition from transactional HR to more strategic HR. Even when we went through so much, we went through an acquisition at the time. There were a lot of long hours and I'll never forget a colleague of mine reminded me where she said, "You know what, guys, we're working for chocolate and candy. Let's put things in perspective here. We're not solving world peace. So let's calm down."

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. We're working for chocolate and candy.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. So she just had this really nice way of putting things in perspective, acknowledging peoples in terms of their work and their contributions and just made it just a wonderful workplace for everyone. That was one boss.

Sharon Giraudel:
The second one is my current boss, I would have to say. And what I really like about him is that he has a nice balance and you don't normally see that at an executive level between the technical and the soft skill side. And he has this way of transitioning between each very seamlessly. The other thing that I like is that when I first joined the company, I've just been with the company for over a year, one of the first things that I heard from folks was that he really provided clear direction, and what they really liked about him was that he's not hierarchical. So like whenever he engaged with them, they felt like they were heard, that he didn't have this air about him, oh my goodness, I'm speaking to the president. He has a natural way about him. And it just made things very easy in terms of engaging with him as well.

Sharon Giraudel:
For him, the other thing that I really liked about him was that he just gave me cart blanche to say, "You know what, here's where we want to go as an organization. Here's the culture that I want us to strive towards. And so Sharon, just go do it." He just gave me the opportunity to really think about the ideas, engage my peers. And that meant a lot because we didn't know each other very well and it was just easy. So to this day, even now, he just says, "Sharon, you're the head of the people pillar, I'm trusting you. So just make it happen." And that means a lot.

Christine Laperriere:
A lot of people talk about best bosses, instilling trust or trusting their people, but a lot of the times we don't understand what that means in action. And so when you're telling that story, what I hear is that is the example of what trust looks like, where, no, I hired you. This is your expertise. Go for it. And getting out of their way. That's really what trust looks like in action.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. I think a lot of it has to do with, he has this entrepreneurial spirit as well, that has a lot to do with where he's coming from. When I work for very big organizations that are over 100,000 people, this organization is about 1,500, it's considered mid-size, I feel that sometimes the smaller organizations, you have more of that flexibility in terms of from leadership. That's been my experience where you don't have all of the hierarchy and it's just a lot easier to get things done. You pull people together, it's a smaller team and you can just move quicker. So it's just in terms of the trust. I do feel something that he learned from great bosses that he's had. And he's talked about some of the experiences he has had that has shaped him in his career. And I believe that he's paying it forward in terms of how he empowers his teams in day-to-day interactions.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I think that's the best part about working for a best boss, is it shapes the type of leader that you become because you see it and you know it works. And so it's easy to replicate. So what have you learned from your not best bosses?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yes. We've all had some of those.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly right.

Sharon Giraudel:
There have been many movies that have done quite well because of bad boss experiences. No, I'm joking. But I have had more, I guess, unfavorable experiences and what I will say though, and I think it's based on where I am in my career is that regardless I learned something from those experiences. So while in terms of the environment, it wasn't a positive environment, like the first example I shared, or my more recent example, there's still a lot of good things that I learned from them from a personal as well as professional level. Resilience is one, but even in terms of technical HR skills and looking at things differently, because some of the bosses I had didn't come from necessarily an HR background.

Sharon Giraudel:
I also believe, Christine, that you meet people in life for a reason, right? And so there's lessons to be learned, lessons that we take with us. Lessons will be repeated until they're learned. I believe that as well. Somebody said that. I don't know who it was. So I kind of look at it that, although they were challenging situations that I've gone through, I also grew from those experiences. It was kind of forced growth, to be honest.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. It wasn't my choice.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yes. It wasn't my choice, but you know what, I'm better for it. And so I'm just moving forward. I tend to try not to look backwards and that's what I took from those experiences.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I mean, when you say that, that immediately triggers something in my mind where I go back to some of my not best bosses, less about their leadership, but sometimes about their expertise and how much I really did gather from working alongside them. Even if I didn't necessarily enjoy their leadership style, I really got a lot from the way that they operated and just subject matter expertise or industry expertise. It's a good reminder, because we usually focus on the bad from those experiences, but also, you're kind of shining a light on the good things that we gain from those.

Sharon Giraudel:
I just don't think it's healthy to reflect and just take that negativity on. It's difficult to think that way, I'm not going to lie. It's difficult while you're in the middle of it. But coming out on the other side, there's a lot of things that I still leverage in my current job in terms of the technical expertise that I gained from those experiences. And so that's what I choose to focus on. It's made me a better professional, I think, as a result of that.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of one leadership practice that stands out from some of the leaders that you worked with, that you particularly enjoyed or found really valuable?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah, there's one that comes to mind and it was, again, the candy and chocolate company that I worked for. It was a leader assimilation exercise where during the first week that I had this new leader on board, we went through an exercise of just five questions that she took us through as a team. And just to help us get to know each other and understand our styles. The first question was, what's the ideal work environment that you enjoy? How do you make decisions? What does it look like when you're stressed? How do you show up when you're stressed? What is your preferred way of communication? And the last one was, how can we help you?

Sharon Giraudel:
And the reason why they're so top of mind is because I just went through this exercise last week because I have another new team member that joined my team. And so we went through this exercise and it's so interesting because each time I've gone through it, even with my existing team, there's something that we learn more about each other, even the ones that I've been working with longer. And even with myself, it was such a powerful exercise, just those five questions. But what I've learned is the sooner or the earlier, you take this approach and you get an understanding, the less your chances are you're going to have misunderstandings in terms of the teams and less assumptions. And so it's really powerful.

Christine Laperriere:
That is a fantastic exercise. Can you repeat those five questions again? I know most people are going to be doing what I'm doing, which is, oh god, I got to go back to that part where she just listed those five questions.

Sharon Giraudel:
The first one was, what is your ideal work environment? The second one was, how do you like to communicate? Third was, how do you show up when you're stressed? How do you make decisions? And the last one is, how can we help you?

Christine Laperriere:
Nice. I really, really like that process. I think you're right. Those are such important conversations. It's almost, if you think of it in context to dating, it's like do you want to live in the city or do you want to live in the country? Those are important things to make sure that the fit actually works, right?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. And I just found that they were so simple, five simple questions and we went through it. There are things that I had no idea, even with individuals that I've known longer on the team that didn't show up in the last time we went through the exercise. I just feel that they're just simple, powerful, and I really recommend them to anybody that's starting with a new team.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great. I'm going to be recommending that to people everywhere. That is a great practice. There's always a debate over the impact of best bosses and not best bosses to the bottom line or, for example, you and I know, we talk about investing in people and supporting people and what is the impact to the bottom line? So I'm curious in your expertise, especially given that you understand people in an organization, how important they are, but you also have to live with metrics and results as well, can you tell me, what do you believe the impact is to the bottom line of soft skills and great leadership?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah, I mean, they are definitely underestimated. In my experience, you often see that individuals are rewarded based on their technical experiences. It's just natural versus some of the soft skills, which are extremely challenging. It's really, as I mentioned, the example with my current boss in terms of how he transitions from technical to soft skills, but they're so critical. And understanding people, understanding what motivates individuals is really what is going to help you get the best out of them in terms of results.

Sharon Giraudel:
And I also think about this model that a friend of mine introduced me to, again, at that same company, that chocolate company, and it was called PAMOD. And it was something like performance equals ability, times motivation, times opportunity, times direction. Right? If an individual is not at their best at any of those four factors, then that's going to ultimately impact their performance.

Sharon Giraudel:
And so I've found that this model, when I'm having a conversation with some leaders even, in terms of, okay, when they're saying that something may not be working, I try to say, okay, how do I put some of this into that formula? Are they motivated? Do they have the tools and skills that are enabling their performance? Is there the opportunity in terms of exposure, and what is the leader doing in terms of direction? Is their direction clear because often people assume that they're clear? And I think this remote environment has really taught us that as well, that it's so important to have those frequent check-ins because you don't have the luxury of just stepping outside the office or them coming to your office and asking for clarification, do you have a minute or whatnot? Right?

Sharon Giraudel:
So I think that in terms of all of those things really impact one's ability to be successful and a leader sometimes don't recognize that. They kind of put all of the ownership on performance on the individual and not understand the role that they play in terms of direction. That's the simplest way that I can explain it, if that makes sense.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I loved that explanation because I think there's going to be leaders that are listening to this right now, going, oh, interesting. Those four ideas make a lot of sense. And I guess, to your point, I always find leadership and people and culture so interesting because it's multiple variables at the same time playing out. So it's never just performance. It's never just expertise. It's like, but how do you unravel that? And I mean, again, it's hard to measure. I think your answer that it's highly underestimated is exactly what my experience has showed me is that it's hard to see it in the metrics, but I know when I'm working with someone who's disengaged or who doesn't feel motivated or valued, the results are significantly different. Do you have any last words of wisdom or tips for anybody that's listening today?

Sharon Giraudel:
One of the things that I think is hardest for leaders when they're thinking of their teams and performance is giving feedback or feedforward. And what I really like, I don't know if you've heard of Kim Scott, Radical Candor, have you heard of her?

Christine Laperriere:
Yes. Yes. It's great.

Sharon Giraudel:
What I really like about that model and just the concept is that you really are showing genuine care when you tell someone the truth. I really encourage people to be open and to share feedback in real time. And the way that I position it often, even in my informal and formal performance discussions, is that I need to tell you the truth because I do care because life happens, things happens. And if I'm not here or something happens, I don't want there to be any surprises. I want people to say... I don't want them to say, how come you're not aware of this, and if you're not aware, and if I don't make you aware, then I'm not setting you up for success.

Sharon Giraudel:
So I think it's so important and it's difficult, I know for some people, because they feel they're hurting somebody. You're not really doing them any favors by not telling them the truth. And in the absence of truth, they make up stories and that can be even more demotivating. And so my advice to folks is to really, if you are seeing that there are things that aren't making people as effective as they could be, whether it's through soft skills or technical, you really need to tell them the truth. And in real time, they'll be better for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. That is such a incredible piece of wisdom. I'm smiling because I can think of a time that I was presenting and someone who again, cared about my success came up and said, "You're using so much self-deprecating humor, you're actually hurting your own credibility." And I knew her and respected her and I'll never forget her giving me that piece of feedback after I had taught for the day. It was just wildly insightful. She literally changed the course and the way that I performed just by really giving me an observation that was authentic. She's like, "You know your stuff. You've got everybody's attention. You're not having any problem with that," but she's like, "Why beat up on yourself in front of people? It's not funny." And I was like, "Wow, I don't think I would've ever known. I always say it was that broccoli in the teeth moment." And it came from a caring place. So the ability to do that at the same time, it changes the way you pay attention to your performance in the future. So, I'm smiling while you mentioned that.

Sharon Giraudel:
Great.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it's good. The Radical Candor is fantastic. There was so many good tips in here. So I have to tell you, I really appreciate this, Sharon. I'm going to probably have to listen to this a few times and make sure I capture all those good questions and that model that you gave. There are so many usable tactical things that we can action out of this. And then I'm going to take it back to the fact that I love the story of your first best boss with the infectious laugh. I've seen that in you, where when we work together, I feel like we always have a laugh, even though we roll up our sleeves and then we get down to work. So I think that's probably one of the things that stands out and why I really enjoyed working with you is I remember us having a laugh and talking about personal things for a couple minutes and talking about our families and then we roll up our sleeves and we get to work.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. I think it's so important. Life is short. We're going through so much right now. I jokingly say that it'd be nice to put in our job descriptions must have a good sense of humor.

Christine Laperriere:
I like that. I'm going to add that to my job description too. I think that everybody can appreciate that. So, if you're listening today go have a laugh.

Sharon Giraudel:
That's right. Have a laugh.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much, Sharon, have an amazing day and we really appreciate your time.

Sharon Giraudel:
You're very welcome, Christine. And anytime.

Christine Laperriere:
And the reason that I brought Mike on the show, this is really actually quite special for me is that Mike was my first coach. So back in 2003, 2004, I got the opportunity to work with Mike as he coached me through really taking a deep dive into what I was doing, because I was a vehicle engineer at the time. And him really trying to help me understand who I was authentically and what kind of career I really wanted to lead. So I think it's pretty incredible. I thought he had the coolest job on the planet, at the time. So it is pretty incredible that today I'm a coach as well and kind of followed in your footsteps, but you were definitely part of the inspiration that led me down the path. So I am thrilled to have you on today, Mike.

Mike Lindstrom:
The best part is when student becomes colleague, at some point or vice versa, that's even better.

Christine Laperriere:
Why don't you share a little bit of your background?

Mike Lindstrom:
I mean, it's so funny because people anymore, they go on Google or YouTube or Wikipedia and they see all this stuff. "Oh he is a writer. He worked for Robbins', he's speaker and all that stuff." So I try to make it real simple. So I did go to law school, but I'm not a practicing attorney. So literally the month after I graduated from law school, the gentleman I'm going to probably talk about today. His name is Dan Lier was working for Tony Robbins, the motivational speaker, who I didn't know from anybody at the time hired me basically out of school to become a speaker and a coach working for Robbins for two years.

Mike Lindstrom:
We did speaking events on the road. And then in 2000, 2001, we started coaching company in La Jolla, California. It was called Robbin's Results Partnership. And we worked predominantly with entrepreneurs, salespeople making over a quarter million dollars, professional athletes and celebrities. So I helped Tony build the business and I told him it was time for me to spread my wings. I started my own coaching practice, not in direct conflict. He gave me his blessing and said, "Good luck and represent our brand well." And I never looked back, so here I am.

Christine Laperriere:
So, with that, then tell us more about this best boss ever? That's always the question.

Mike Lindstrom:
Yeah. So Dan Lier it's L-I-E-R, if you want to pull him up, Dan's in our industry, he's a speaker. He's actually the top speaker in Las Vegas. I mean, during COVID obviously was much difficult, right? And no assembly, no getting together live, so that hurt his business a little bit. But imagine you live right outside of Las Vegas, but you can do two or three keynotes a day, drive down to the Strip, work with some major corporation, get paid a ton of money, talk for an hour and go home, right? So he's got a pretty sweet gig, nowadays.

Mike Lindstrom:
But with Dan, I didn't know from anybody, he was a mutual friend that introduced us because my buddy had just joined the team at Robbins. He was from San Diego. He said, "You got to get in touch with this guy. Dan, I'm telling you, they're looking for more people. They want energetic people. People that are educated. They're going to really represent Tony's brand in the North American territory."

Mike Lindstrom:
Now, when I heard that word North American territory, I'm thinking, "Wow, this sounds like a travel job, right?" Sure enough, it was. We lived in five cities per year. So my first city was Atlanta, Georgia. Then in Philadelphia, San Francisco, LA, Chicago, New York, it was awesome. We'd live there for six to eight weeks. And we would basically promote the Robbins brand, but we'd also sell a one day event. It was called, The Competitive Edge at the time. Now it's Bunked. It's a different program.

Mike Lindstrom:
So Dan was literally the guy who hired me to join the traveling team. So, you imagine you have 12 people and this guy, Dan and his wife, Tammy at the time, traveling all over the country. So he was my boss day in, day out. We lived in the same community. We'd see each other on the weekends at the pool because we had corporate housing. We'd see each other at happy hours on Friday. So not just like a boss, you would go see at an office place. You're on the road living literally with this individual. So he literally took me under his wing. He's 10 years older than me exactly. So we just had so many things. He said, "You're me 10 years ago, man. I see myself in you. So I want to make sure you don't stumble the way I did." So, he took my success and failure very personally. I was lucky to have him as really my first real boss I would call him. And Tony was his boss. So I'm one degree removed from Tony Robbins himself.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me a little bit about when let's say the team had a mess up or they were doing something? Again, you're living with the person too, so that's not easy, but give me an example of how would Dan respond?

Mike Lindstrom:
And that was the other part about having him literally with us on the road, he would go out to meetings with us. So we had a script we had to follow to a T. I mean, Tony was really big on framing, context is what we call it syntax, the order in which you present information. We had to record ourselves, send videos in. Back in the day it was tapes, right, to Tony. He would review them and then give you feedback. But Dan would go out to live meetings with you. And I'll never forget this. My first cycle. That's what we call the city cycle, was Atlanta. And I'm fresh out of law school. I was actually the most "educated" person on the team. I was a little cocky, single guy, just kind of thinking I had this swagger.

Mike Lindstrom:
I was actually competitive. In law school we would do a mock trial. So I was used to being in front of a judge, a jury, speaking, presenting came very naturally for me. So to have Dan come out and ride with you, your boss come out and sit in the meeting and I would never forget this. It was a real estate company and he recorded it and we were in the car and he asked me a question and now I know this famous question. He says, "Mike, let me ask you a question. He goes zero to 10. 10 is the best presentation you've ever done for us. Zero is the worst ever. What would you rate yourself?" And I'm thinking, "Okay, loaded question. How do I answer this? No such thing as a 10, because you can always improve, right?"

Mike Lindstrom:
And I said, "I'd say an eight, I'd say an eight." And he just goes, "Wow. Wow." Never forget that. He said, "Two wows." Which I didn't know what that meant at the time. He said, "I would've gave you like a two." So we got a problem because you think you're an eight and that's a two. So we got a lot of work to do. So this weekend, I better not see you out at the pool. I better not see you at happy hour in the neighborhood. I better not see you out with the team. I want you to nail that script. If I knock on your door at eight o'clock Saturday night, okay. I want to see those big post-it notes all around your condo. And hoping you have walked and pasted that whole thing, 100s of times to nail the script because you don't have it nailed."

Mike Lindstrom:
Now that was my biggest first lesson is, "Holy crap. I'm not prepared. There's always another level." I mean, there's so much coaching going on in this moment, right? I didn't leave my apartment all weekend. I studied that script. I literally pasted that. I had the post-it notes of every chunk as we called it. And I did my meeting on Monday, did much better obviously, but he came out and rode with me a month later and he told me he was proud of me, which I appreciate. Having your boss and coach tell you, he is proud of you. But he said, "You still got work to do, buddy. You're the newest guy on the team and you still don't have it. There's tonality shifts. There's body language. There's certain anchors that have to go into that script that you don't have nailed." So I was kind of the first lesson of the worst case scenario for my own self. But I never saw like the veterans majorly screw up. I just saw myself screw up and I know how hard he was on me because you had to over prepare.

Christine Laperriere:
I love this story. This is such a great story, especially given that I work with so many sales teams, right? And we go through this, going on the road and people thinking they nailed it. And meanwhile, from a third party observer it's not close. Now, why did that not demotivate you? A lot of people listening would be saying, "Oh God, that's not my best boss. That's my worst boss."

Mike Lindstrom:
Right. Well, in the interview for process, Dan knew my background. I was an athlete growing up. So I played baseball, basketball, football. He asked me those kind of questions in the interviewing process. "Tell me about your background? Were you a competitor? Were you an athlete in any way?" So he knew I had that athletic kind of mentality, football mentality being in the locker room. He was a two time national champion basketball player at Fort Hays State. So, I knew he was an athlete and he understood that coaching element. Beat them up a little bit. Let them think they're good, but not really. And then, pick them up and you build them up.

Mike Lindstrom:
So we kind of knew that about each other. So I noticed he didn't do that with my friend, Tiffany, next person to come in right after me. She was the next rookie. Tiffany came in and I remember he tried that approach with her the first month and it did not work. She came home to the apartment, crying in tears. "What did I do? Why did I leave my job to come out here and live with all you guys? I don't even know you guys." I said, "Look, I went through this, Tiffany. I'm going to help you out. I promise. We're going to keep you in and study your script." So, as you know, as a coach, you have to know how to tap into that person's motivation. Some people love the tough love and some people don't. I mean, we learned quickly that that didn't work for Tiffany, but that worked for Mike Lindstrom, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
So he changed his style for Tiffany, so she stayed on the team then?

Mike Lindstrom:
Yeah. She stayed on the team. In fact, she moved up to kind of like the next level team and really kicked butt. Dan was very adroit at kind of knowing what he was dealing with, with each individual, male, female, older, younger. Some of the guys on the team. If you remember, I was 25, 26 years old, right out of law school. We had had team members in their mid 30s closer to Dan's age. So he could kind of talk to them different. He was also a father. I wasn't, I was a single guy. So he would always kind of play the right angle. But he was very good at kind of knowing what he was dealing with.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And to me, that is definitely a quality of a best boss ever, who knows how to say, "Everybody on the team is important, but I am going to shift my style to build up everybody." But what I'm really hearing too, is that he took your performance or your capability and really did unleash it and built you up to a varsity player from a junior varsity, right? Or maybe a little leagues. You walked in the door and thought you were in the game but he was like, "No, no, no, you got a lot longer to go."

Mike Lindstrom:
Well, you know, what's funny? I mean, I'm not private about this. I'm very public about it, but I don't get asked these kind of questions about bosses and mentors. So this topic is near and dear to me. So I had a coach named Robert Alderman. Robert is a famous coach. He passed away, God bless, a couple years ago, lived about late, late 70s. He was literally Tony Robbin's coach, not mentor, Jim Rohn. Jim was his mentor, brought him up in the business. So he kind considered him as a mentor. He brought in Robert to coach him on understanding behavior, understanding the DISC, like a technical perspective.

Mike Lindstrom:
So once Robert and Tony became really close, Tony required Robert to coach all the leaders in the firm. So I got promoted to basically run that coaching company. Robert became my coach. So I had Dan Lier and Tony over here, within the company, my bosses. And then I had this coach outside of the organization that Tony said that, "You're going to learn a lot from this guy." And I remember the coaching being very different styles, but they were all saying the same thing. They're like, "Mike, your stint here at the Robbins Organization will be short because you're an entrepreneur, you're a high dominant person. You're a high influencer, low steady, low compliant. This is classic high D high I. You're going to learn and go. I mean, the fact that you've been here, as long as you have, we're surprised."

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Mike Lindstrom:
But that's important to know as a coach that you're dealing with someone and this is a story you and I had. When I saw your DISC profile and you're an engineer, it just didn't add up. I'm like, "Why is she doing this, when her profile tells me she should be doing this?" So, it's having that ability to adapt the styles based off that person's own style.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. That's fantastic. So we picked your brain on best boss. Now you've had a chance to work with lots of different leaders. I'm kind of curious, what are the trends you see in great leaders? Not just the vague piece, but give us the stories, give us the meat and give me the examples of those leaders where you really do see them break away from the rest?

Mike Lindstrom:
So you're right. I got caught up in after the Robbins days, I was a dotcom kid too. So I got lucky to find that whole wave same time, '99, 2000, 2001. So watching that startup mentality, believing in this brand, we're going to take it public. And everyone's drinking the Kool-Aid like I went through all of that. It was awesome. It was great success. Great failure. I mean, I made an amazing network of people. So I've been in and out of starterups over the years. Even in the cannabis industry, for example, someone would say, "Hey, you may or may not be involved with what the product is, but we need to build a company. Can we have you come in and help us because we like to replicate Fortune 500 companies in the industry, because it's never been done before?"

Mike Lindstrom:
To me, that's exciting because you're going to take a leader who started something. I don't care if it's a piece of technology or in the cannabis space, you're going to find a quality about the leader that they're trying to replicate. That's how you build a culture. The base word of culture is cult, common language, common belief, common direction. The problem is we think of Jim Jones in Ghana and 800 people drinking Kool-Aid that's what we think of when hear the word cult. Like Apple, Google, these companies are so cultish, Netflix, because they got everybody from the top down drinking the Kool-Aid. But they understand from at the top what they're stirring.

Mike Lindstrom:
There was a method and that's what I've learned over the years, watching great companies go from good to great. Jim Collins talks about in his book is that the great leaders are very methodical about what they're putting in the Kool-Aid. It's not accidental. They are being successful because they're driving home a certain thing during that meeting. They have core values that are literally published on the wall. Every single individual, like at Lululemon, they know purpose and why period. I don't care if you're answering the phones or you're an executive purpose and why is a big part of Lululemon's culture. So, that starts at the top, speed of leader, speed of pack.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is such a perfect example because I talk about that all the time. Like culture, I work with so many leaders and I'm always talking about how people mirror one another, they just do. We are humans and our brains are built to mirror one another. And you can watch us either subconsciously in a room when one person crosses their legs, you'll watch three more people cross their legs or one person yells at their employee and you watch three more people think that, that's what leadership is. They go to their next meeting and they yell at the next person. And so it is just phenomenal how you've explained culture and being intentional with it because I feel like I'm always trying to tell that story. I love the idea too, of the use of the word cult. You're right. It's got a negative pejorative to it. I guess it's not one that we use often, but it is what culture really is what it is, right?

Mike Lindstrom:
So Dave Liniger is the founder of Remax, the real estate company. And he's really progressive about training. And I've done training with those guys for a long, long time and Dave and I are friends. He lives in Colorado and he's got international franchise sales territories. So it was a couple years ago we had me come in as a keynote and a trainer. And we actually did some of the old school stuff. We did the board breaking and stuff that some people kind of see maybe as cheesy in the modern day. Tony Robbins still does a fire walk gimmicky or not, people are going to go do it.

Mike Lindstrom:
So I took a little couple just creative liberties. I said, "Do you guys know what a cult is?" Did the whole bit in front of the room. And I said, "You know, you guys are a cult?" Dave's in there, back in the room, laughing. They all stood up and clapped for themselves. They were so proud that they were being called a cult, the red, white, and blue balloon, whether it's recognized brands in the real estate industry in the whole wide world. They're proud of that. But you go talk to Dave Liniger and his wife that started that company in the early 70s when they flipped the real estate model on its head and said, "Why are we taking your commissions? You work so hard. Why don't we just take a fee, give you a 100% of your commission and let you be, build your own brand? Just go fly the balloon. We'll help you do it." Genius in 1972 or whatever it was. So to have him, tell you that he's very proud of that. It's because he knows the method. He knows what he is stirring.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that. I know some people are going to be smiling while they're thinking about that. Because you're right. We all know Remax. That's not a hard name to identify with. What an incredible brand. So any last kind of words of wisdom when you're thinking about all the people out are listening are in cultures where they're either high performers or they're on their way to leadership. And I'm really hoping that this show helps inform them about how they think about leading. I'd really like people to think, not just about being a good enough manager, but truly trying to be a best boss ever and really influence people's lives for the better. What are your words of wisdom for them?

Mike Lindstrom:
So the one thing that I've become more and more just congruent with probably the last five years, I mean COVID really helped me bring it home even further is when somebody hears the word brand, they think of a company, right? Apple, Google, Remax, et cetera. In sports, you have the logo on the front. That's the team, the logo that everyone recognizes, whether it's the Dallas Cowboys or New York Yankees, all these big brands in the world. But the name on the back of the Jersey, that's you as the individual. Being really mindful of your personal brand. Personal brand. You're not getting out from underneath the company brand and it's not selfish and it's not egotistical.

Mike Lindstrom:
You have to be mindful of your personal brand. How do people talk about you behind your back? If I interviewed three to five people in your company and said, "Hey, tell me about this individual. What's great about them and what's not great about them? Are you aware of that? Do you even know your own profile? Have you ever done the DISC profile or Drake or Dots?" And there's a million of them out there. You go learn all of that. Get coaching. I mean, that's why you do what we do. Watching that person really truly look introspectively and say, "I need to work on myself to be better within a bigger brand called the company." So I think that's something that gets lost.

Mike Lindstrom:
And I hate to say this and I won't name company names, but there are certain companies out there. They don't want that. They don't want you building your personal brand. They want you to be a worker bee. You show up at eight, get your one hour break at noon and you're off at five and we pay you the same money every two weeks. We don't want you to grow. We don't want to disrupt the apple cart. But that's a problem. Those companies will never have that big culture that you and I talked about.

Mike Lindstrom:
The Dave Linigers of the world, they would never go work for that company because they promote branding at the individual level. So if you want to really take a good, hard look in the mirror about the company that you want to work with, you want to look at, "Can I grow in this company? Do they invest in me? Are they going to give me grief that I'm going to go take three days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and need a day off without having to do PTO because I want to go to a seminar to be a better negotiator?" I mean, that's where you start to see, do they really believe in you? And I think that personal branding thing is so big and it gets lost for some reason in training.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that you're saying that. I'm grinning because I teach personal branding as a huge portion of a lot of the leadership programs that I work on. It forces you to reflect too. And it forces you to get authentic about what you're really trying to be as far as a leader. So if you go back to that idea of best boss ever, it makes sense that that person would be waking up knowing that they want to be a best boss ever. That was part of their personal brand. It was part of the intention that they were bringing.

Mike Lindstrom:
So I have one exercise. I'll give this to you. I don't remember if you and I did this, obviously I'm a journal guy. What's written is real. And I've been carrying this everywhere I go. And it's not a diary, people. It's a journal. It's a capture mechanism. It's a thought, it's a quote. It's a movie. So I don't sit there every night going, "Dear Mike. Oh, today was kind of a weird day." That's a diary. This is a journal. Journaling is something that you just have close to you when you have random thoughts. So here's a journal exercise. It's great prompt. Always date your pages. Date the page so you can always remember. And you ask this one question. I am at my best when..... And you fill up a whole journal page in bullet points.

Mike Lindstrom:
Now I know my journals have 28 lines. I've got six by nine. There's, 28 lines on this journal. That's at least 28 I have to answer every single line, 28 times. I am at my best when I wake up early. I am my best when I work out. I am at my best when I have private, authentic, real time with my kids every night before they go to bed. Whatever. I'm just rattling stuff off. But you got to create that best version of yourself because no one's going to do it for you. This manual, wasn't gifted to you in college or law school for me. I had to go find people like Dan Lier and Tony Robbins and Robert Alderman to force me to do these kind of things. So I looked in the mirror and said, "I am at my best When." And I know what that is. And I know when I'm not there. If I'm incongruent in any way, it's stressful. You know, when you're not at your best, you know this?

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Mike Lindstrom:
But, oh, I'm off to today. I've done it on stages. I've done it on coaching calls, but you have to have a blueprint of, "You at your best when," and really go in depth with that and be brutally honest with that.

Christine Laperriere:
Ah, what a fantastic prompt. I'm laughing because I actually use that as part of the personal branding exercises, such a simple way to tap into what your values are, what energizes you, what works for you. And I think that's a great call to action for people who are listening today.

Mike Lindstrom:
Love it.

Christine Laperriere:
Mike, this was fantastic. I really appreciate your time. Is there a simple way anybody, if they're listening right now, I'm sure they're going to be pretty fired up, how do they stalk you on social media?

Mike Lindstrom:
So I'm on all social. I mean, what I've been gravitating to more and more lately is LinkedIn. So I love connecting with people on LinkedIn. I've never turned down a request on LinkedIn. LinkedIn does a good job of policing its community. Facebook, I might not say that there's people I might accept or not. I'm kind of private about my personal stuff on Facebook, but in LinkedIn for sure. Mike Lindstrom, JD. That's my law degree. If you Google it, you can see the baldheaded guy. But my website is mikelindstrom.com There's a D in there. L-I-N-D-S-T-R-O-M. I'm in the process of redoing it by the way. So it may be up or down or not where I want it to be right now, but it's always going to be live. And all my social media links are on there. I have a YouTube channel that's attached to the website. So, that's easiest way. Just go to mikelindstrom.com or hit me on LinkedIn.

Christine Laperriere:
Lovely. Thank you so much. This was awesome. Thanks so much.

Mike Lindstrom:
You know what? I want to leave you with this. Because I have told your story on stages. I told you this before, and I mean this, I'm so proud of what you've done. Because going from being that worker bee, engineer type of job, right, which you can relate with, to go out there and want to change the impact of the world. How much money we make in the world is directly tied to the influence we have on how many people we influence. So if we only influence four people, well, you're going to get paid according to that. But if you go out and stand on stages and write books, you're influencing 100s of 1000s, millions of people, and that's not just financial wealth, that's the abundance of mindset and the sharing and you're doing that. I'm so proud of you and it's an honor to be on your podcasts and do this and have fun.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, thank you so much. And I love the fact that you are really the start of that journey. So it's so special to have you on. So thank you so much.

Mike Lindstrom:
Thank you. Appreciate you.

Christine Laperriere:

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast


Episode: 14
Title: Permission to express emotion
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Dr. Jessica Metcalfe

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever show. And today, I have on Jessica Metcalfe. Thank you so much, Jessica, for being on the show.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thanks so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
The coolest part is as we were on a panel together at the Women and Wealth Conference, not too long ago, and I found the stories that you were sharing about the dentistry industry, which is what you're in, it just was incredible to hear your perspective. And also, the fact that I guess, you learn leadership in a very different way than so many of us in the corporate world. So I just had to have you on the show. I love the fact that you bring a very fresh perspective to this discussion. So I'm thrilled you're here.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you so much. It's very interesting, exactly what you said with the dental industry. I do clinical dentistry, I own a dental clinic. And then, I started another business where I help individuals or the high achievers battle imposter phenomenon, perfectionism, and prevent burnout.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. And I mean, so many of us very much relate to that special business that you've created on the side. So I think that's very exciting. Tell us who is your best boss ever and why?

Jessica Metcalfe:
It's very interesting because no one person comes to mind. I have snippets from the leaders and the mentors or the role models who have been in my life. And the reason for that is because of the way dentistry is set up. And so, a couple of the individuals that come to mind are the ones who really pulled me aside early on my career and really wanted to know what my vision was within dentistry, with my own personal life, and how they could then help me strive for that, and how they would then fit into what it looked like for me.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And the reason why that was so important is because early on, especially when our high achieving mentality is get really good grades, get into school, get even better grades at that point in time, graduate, finish residency, and then become an associate or then become an owner and run your own dental clinic. And because you kind of get stuck in that hamster wheel aspect of next step, next step, next step, sometimes you don't give yourself that opportunity to breathe and take a look at the fact that what do I actually want?

Jessica Metcalfe:
And so, the individuals who really stood out for me are the ones who gave me the opportunity to share with them early on, being like, "Well, this is what I think." And then we would have a really honest and open conversation being like, "Okay, this is maybe where you need to take your energy. This is maybe the next education step that you want to take. And maybe don't jump in too far into the deep end, right off the bat with this," but not saying that you can't do it. So it's that empowerment aspect, which I find was consistent with the top bosses who come to mind for me.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you can think of, for instance, one of those leaders that had a specific characteristic or trait that you really admire, tell us a little bit more about them.

Jessica Metcalfe:
So this individual is so very calm and levelheaded, had been in the years for multiple decades. And there was one day where I was just having a really bad day in clinic and I just felt it was one of those kind of steam roller days. And it ended up at the point where I closed the door to my office and I just started crying my eyes out. And I was like, "I am not fit for this at all." So I was giving myself the moment. And I heard a knock on the door and he came over. And at this point in time, I know my eyes are super red. I'm trying to wipe the tears and I'm like, "Okay-"

Christine Laperriere:
Don't let anyone know I'm crying.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Exactly. I'm like, "I don't know who's on the opposite side of the door right now at this point." So I was like, "Okay, compose, compose." And then I opened up the door and he walked in. He's like, "Do you want to sit and chat?" And I was just like, "Okay." And so, we closed the door and he's like, "How are you doing?" I said, "I'm fine." And he's like, "No. How are you really doing?" And it was just that moment, where all of a sudden, I just started to cry again, and I couldn't hold back my tears. And we sat for the next 15, 20 minutes and he is such a calm individual, which that then I felt just fell onto me. All of a sudden, the environment was calm. All of a sudden, what I felt was a disaster was no longer a disaster.

Jessica Metcalfe:
So that in and of itself, where he walked in, exuded this calmness, but then also respected the fact that I was extremely emotional and that didn't define me as a dentist, as an individual, or even as a woman in what I was doing. It was, "This is the situation and how are we going to figure out? So then, it doesn't necessarily happen exactly the same way the next time." And I am so very grateful for that encounter because it then set me up for how I want to continue to lead my own team moving forward.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that story. And I think it's so important to talk about... I find there's not a lot of leaders. Thankfully, the ones we talk about on the Best Boss Ever show are, but not a lot that are very good at handling emotion. When somebody's in tears, I notice that a lot of people are really uncomfortable with that.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And I always say, "We're processing anger. That's not sad tears. That's not boohoo." That's like-

Jessica Metcalfe:
Frustration.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yeah. And it is. And I hate that I question myself with it, and it's taken me a while to come to the understanding and just be okay with when I'm experiencing certain emotions, because you're allowed to experience them. You're human at the end of the day. So I have to give myself permission to be like, "Okay, tears well up out of frustration and anger and rage, it's fine. It's just the way that my own body responds." And in that moment, he was accepting of that. And that is exactly what I needed.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Now, when I am placed in situations or even when I see patients who are sitting in front of me and they're sharing their experiences, I look at it from a completely different perspective now.

Christine Laperriere:
So it even made you better with your patients?

Jessica Metcalfe:
100%.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. I never thought about this before, but as a dentist, you have to learn how to be a leader without really having anybody model leadership for you.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell us like, what is that like?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Very interesting, to say the least. So you are kind of thrown into the deep end. In dental school, you're taught how to be a dentist. You're taught all the clinical aspect behind it, all the worst case scenarios that can happen, but you're not taught the management. You're not taught that when you own an office or run multiple offices and there's group practice set up and you have a team manager, you have your front desk staff, you have your dental assistants, hygiene, you have an entire team that you need to run with all different personalities. You don't necessarily know how to be a leader. So you're being thrown into the deep end and it's a sink or swim, but it's also then how you decide, "Okay, am I going to keep evolving? Am I going to keep adapting? Am I only going to focus on the clinical dentistry aspect of it, and then hope the management stuff works out? Or am I going to try to manage the management side as well, and then clinical dentistry will follow along suit with it?"

Jessica Metcalfe:
So it's unfortunate in the sense that especially for dentists, being overachievers or high achievers, type A personalities, perfectionists, when things don't necessarily go right, or there are problems, sometimes we just don't even know what to do from a management perspective, because we've never had to experience this before. And it's not that we haven't worked other jobs. It's just, we don't know what to do in a leadership situation. And that's challenging in and of itself and can take an emotional, mental and physical toll on us.

Christine Laperriere:
As you're saying this, I'm thinking about how many years I've spent obviously working with leaders and doing leadership training and development and you don't just get trained on it and even know what to do. So you're going in cold. And in addition, there's very little for you to model yourself after, or little training. You're not stopping for leadership training in the middle of doing your work. So that's interesting. So tell me a little bit about what was that learning curve like for you as you were stepping into leadership? What did you do right? What did you do wrong?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Well to this day, I think I'm still doing things right and wrong. Which that's the beauty about leadership, is trying to figure out what works best for you. So my biggest takeaway in the leadership that I want to embody is situational leadership because not every individual needs the same leadership skills. Someone may need a little bit more handholding later on. Someone may need a little bit more autonomy. Someone may be just extremely creative. So it's trying to fit them in. "Okay, well where do they then fit within the dental team?" And even within the last eight months, I was thrust into a role that I wasn't expecting. And there was a lot of pressure put on me, right from the get go.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And I remember a situation where... As you can tell, I'm a very energetic, bubbly, happy person, but then there's also the other side of me being the perfectionist. I want things done a certain way. There's a reason why successive procedures get done. The clinic runs efficiently and there's a time and a place for certain things. And we were incorporating a new position into clinic and it just wasn't functioning properly. And I found with the partnership leadership that I was working with, that we weren't communicating properly. And in doing so, I felt like the situation fell to the wayside. What I take away as what I had done wrong is I pulled someone aside and I yelled at them, and I walked away from that situation being like, "I never want to be that person again."

Jessica Metcalfe:
First off I was in the office. I closed the door because I refuse to ever yell at someone in front of a group of individuals because I've had that happen to me as a resident. And that is just uncalled for on all levels. And so, I pulled this person aside, but I'm standing, yelling at her and as it's happening, I'm like, "What am I doing? This is not the leadership that I wanted to become." So I left that situation, and I remember thinking about it for weeks afterwards. And I thought, "Okay, what was the actual situation at hand? Why did I get to that point? How could I have looked at it differently and I need to go apologize to this person," which is exactly what I did. I went, I apologized, I owned my mistake, which that's a huge thing in leadership because we're human, again. We all make mistakes, but you have to make sure you own it.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And I walked away from that being like, "I need to make sure this doesn't ever happen again." So it was a learning experience, that it doesn't matter who or what situation that I'm in next time, just as if I'm walking into a complicated procedure and I take a deep breath and I become focused, I need to do the exact same situation when it comes to managing people's expectations or managing the clinic as a whole. It's taking a deep breath, focus and then walking into the situation instead of just exploding.

Christine Laperriere:
That's such a good example. Well, first of all, cheers to the apology. I was just talking to someone who had a challenge with their boss and there was no apology. And so, once trust is damaged and there's no repair, it's very difficult to move forward, where you went back and did the repair work. So Kudos.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
That's a good step. I'm sure that person appreciated the apology. What wisdom would you give to anybody who has caught themselves yelling at an employee? I heard you say, take a deep breath and focus, but is there any other tools or tips that you use to really kind of bring it down?

Jessica Metcalfe:
First off, I make sure I don't just automatically walk into a situation where I'm fuming, because that's not going to serve anyone and I'm not going to get to a solution at that point in time. So now what I do, I take a step back, I try to examine all the different sides of the story on why potentially that individual did what they did. And so now it's, "Okay, maybe I'm not seeing something that they saw and that's why they acted or reacted the way that they did to the situation." And so, I now ask myself a couple questions and think, "Okay, if I were in the situation, this is how I would respond. But they were in the situation, so we're not two same people. So because of that, they're going to respond differently. So let's go in and ask questions this time."

Jessica Metcalfe:
So instead of me going in with just blanket statements and saying, "You did this wrong. Why did you do this?" And so on and so forth. I go in and I say, "Explain to me why your thought process was the way that it was." So then now it gives me an understanding on, "Well, maybe they weren't actually on the same wavelength as I was, or maybe I explained how to do something inappropriately, or they misinterpreted something." So now there's a miscommunication. So it doesn't mean that they were doing it wrong. They thought that they were doing it right, which in actuality they were, because of the miscommunication. So I think that plays a huge part in taking a step back and taking a deep breath before jumping and fuming is, "Okay, let's actually gather all the facts first before making an assumption or jumping to a conclusion and then recognizing, okay, if there is a miscommunication, how can we go about fixing this? And then what can we do the next time, so then there isn't a miscommunication?" Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Beautiful. I'm sure there's some people out there listening going, "Of course, that makes so much sense." And it's such a good reminder because so many of us in the heat of the moment, that's not our instinct. And so, you've had to rewire that instinct.

Jessica Metcalfe:
The rewiring is exactly, it's hard. It's hard, but it's possible. That's the biggest thing, because I've had to do the same thing with procedures that make me overly anxious. Otherwise, I walk in and your thoughts are just jumbled and I'm not going to be the best dentist that I need to be at that point in time for the patient. So it's rewiring to get more clarity about the situation. And I agree, it's definitely easier said than done, but the more that you do it, it becomes that much easier.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that's such a good answer. Thank you. I have two more questions for you. The first is, when we were on that panel, we had a really meaningful conversation about imposter syndrome. If you had to share with our audience what you've learned and unfortunately, I know this is a side business for you, that you have a lot of content around, but maybe just even from your experience, what have you learned from seeing yourself battle imposter syndrome and maybe some words of wisdom for leaders who are trying to be best bosses? What do they need to watch out for when it comes to that?

Jessica Metcalfe:
I'm going to give an easy definition. It's where self-doubt and the fear failure are so overwhelming that you feel like you're going to be found out. So you underestimate your abilities, you explain away your successes, you don't give yourself enough credit. Self-doubt in and of itself is completely fine. Self-doubt is a way that allows you to rethink what's happening, get you outside of the periphery, shows that you care about what you're learning about. But when it's coupled with potentially self-sabotaging behaviors and it's preventing you from taking the next steps or taking action, then that's where reevaluation is really important, to make sure then you're not stuck.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And so for me, what I found is, I wasn't taking on certain procedures or I wasn't applying for certain roles or getting involved in organized dentistry to the level that I wanted to because of the fact that I didn't think I was good enough. I didn't have enough of the credentials behind me. And one particular time that comes to mind is lecturing. And now, I speak about imposter syndrome and it's empowering others now to then tell themselves that, "I can take these next steps." Okay, yeah, there's a fear there that something may go wrong, but you won't know unless you actually try.

Christine Laperriere:
I guess, I'm thinking too about how many times leaders probably have that moment. I know I work with a lot of them, where they feel like, "What if I get found out? What if I just got this job by luck and my luck's out to run out?" So I definitely can see that. How does that manifest in performance? When you think of, again, we have all these brilliant brains, but for some reason we get this feeling that we're frauds. How does that manifest in performance?

Jessica Metcalfe:
So in performance, especially in business, it can prevent you from applying for a raise or applying for promotion or putting together an idea or presentation because someone else is going to do it better. There's a self sabotaging behavior within the business component, where it prevents you and can keep you very stagnant. And sometimes, all it is, is it starts with a question on you don't even need to be really straightforward with the question. Because I remember when it was for me in particular and I was starting to come out of my shell and I wanted to know if other people were experiencing this, I would go up and be like, "Hey, asking for a friend, so what about this in particular?" They'd be like, "Oh yeah, I feel that all the time." And what I don't think we're talking about enough is the fact that the majority of us still feel this. It's just, we all hide it. And some of us are just really good at hiding it. And that's-

Christine Laperriere:
I know so many of us that feel it.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Right. And so, as long as you take a look at what is happening and you're continually growing and you don't feel like you're not applying for that promotion or the next job or a move or anything that is a really interesting idea that you want to try, but think that you are not good enough for it or that someone else is better or smarter or works harder, you have that capability to be able to do it. It's just going to look different for each one of us.

Christine Laperriere:
I know that you're about to make a big move yourself. First of all, I'd love you to share what was the inspiration behind that. I really appreciated kind of what you shared about that. And then, tell us a little bit about how that maybe your own imposter syndrome might have tied to this and how you kind of had to confront it for your own next move.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Huge move, moving from Toronto, Ontario to Victoria, British Columbia. And I was a general dentist at a cancer center, and two things put everything into perspective. One being COVID, made us rethink. I am a huge planner to begin with, like 15, 20 year plans. And then all of a sudden COVID happened and made us realize that, "Well, we actually really can't plan because we just don't know." Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Jessica Metcalfe:
The second component was my patient population. I kept hearing the same story over and over again, where, "Save all that money, wait for retirement. Once you get there, you're going to have so much fun." And patients would get there and then they would have a diagnosis of cancer. What they kept then reiterating is, "Don't wait. If there's something that you want to do, do it now." No one's going to ever think twice about, "Did I put into that extra hour of work and was it worth it?" No, people are going to look back and be like, "I really wish I spent more time with family, friends, doing those adventures that I wanted to do when I was more physically and mentally well."

Jessica Metcalfe:
And it honestly put so many things into perspective. And that combination for me of my patients in COVID made me rethink and I was stifling my own self. I didn't even realize that a part of me was still stuck in a very old school mentality of once you graduate, you need to become an associate, work five, six days of clinical dentistry, and then the potentially become an owner. But I recognized the fact that I was linking my self worth in my identity to being a dentist, when I had all these other passions and interests that I wanted to explore. And so, I listened to what my patients had to say and decided to make this big move. So I'm scaling back and doing clinical dentistry and exploring all of these other passions that I have now.

Christine Laperriere:
Ah, I have a feeling that I'm going to hear from some people that story just really inspired them. And the best part is we don't know the punchline yet. We don't know how it turns out. Right?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yeah, totally. And that is the beauty of it, is once you're there, you can figure it out. Give yourself the permission to be able to figure it out because you can. So even though that self-doubt is there, it's okay.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. I think self-doubt, it's a survival technique. But there's also a survival technique which wants us to get out of bed and go live our lives too.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 100%.

Christine Laperriere:
This has been awesome. If there's people that want to follow you and see how your journey unfolds, where should they go check you out?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Two locations. I'm across social media. You can find me under The Alchemist Dentist or you can check out my website at www.drjessicametcalfe.com.

Christine Laperriere:
Beautiful. Jessica, it was fantastic talking to you. I love your energy. I get so-

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
That big, giant smile and I'm feeling like I can do it. So we are all rooting for you. We can't wait to see what unfolds next and thank you again for your time today.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you so much for having me.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast


Episode: 15
Title: Getting everyone on the bus
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Mary Peterson

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you, Mary, for coming on the show. I really appreciate it.

Mary Peterson:
It's great to be here, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
And I'll say for our listeners sake, I had the opportunity to work with you at Samsung, as we were working to advance some of the high potential women that the organization has. So, it was just neat because I ended up sitting alongside you at an event and we got a chance to talk about how much passion we have for this topic. And since then, I've been a big fan of yours. So I'm thrilled that you took the time.

Mary Peterson:
Well, that's nice of you to say, and yes, I enjoyed working together with you and some of that diversity stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
So, today, of course, I'm going to ask you to talk about your best boss ever. And I know you have lots of thoughts on this one, so I'm going to hand it over.

Mary Peterson:
I mentioned to you already, and I'll say it again, that this was a thought provoking topic for me, because I think oftentimes I get asked to talk about my leadership or leadership, but this is really about my experiences. I look back on the many, many years of my career and who inspired me and what type of boss/people manager inspired me, which is different than the motherhood leadership kind of stuff. So, you got me thinking and I really had to put some time into thinking about this, but I think I've got it. And here's some of it.

Mary Peterson:
I started my career in technology in the mid eighties. This industry's come a long way since then, of course, but it also speaks to the fact that I've always been in an industry that's very fast paced and very innovation driven. And so while other companies, other industries, you might get into a role and keep within your boundaries, I think in technology, we were blasting all over because there was no real path to follow. So, we were charting our own paths in a lot of ways. So, combine that with the fact that young Mary gets on to the scene, very ambitious and very competitive and very ready to take on the world and in this very exciting dynamic industry. And so when I look at back at my best bosses, the ones that inspired me and made me better, it's based on that situation. And I think people management is so situational. And what worked for me, I'll tell you about that may not work for the same analytical, introvert person that maybe isn't quite as ambitious.

Mary Peterson:
So here we go. Okay. The first area that I categorized this in would be those bosses that eliminated fear. So, I have a couple examples of this and what that means really is, we can't create innovation. We can't create change, drive, change, drive results if we are fearful of our jobs of trying new things, et cetera, making mistakes. So, a couple of things. First of all, early career Mary. I'm in one of my first sales jobs and I'm ambitious and I'm darn it I'm going to hit my numbers. I'm going to be an overachiever, I'm going to be the top salesperson. I'm going to beat that darn competitor. And I'm going to go for it. I did my work. I did my prep. I did all of that. And once upon a time, I actually lost a deal. That was a big deal and I lost it. I was devastated, right? So this is early in career. I lost the deal. I thought I was all that. And I was devastated.

Mary Peterson:
I finally got the nerve, went into the office and told my boss that I lost this deal. And he said, "Come into my office." Come into his office, shut the door. And I thought, "Oh no, oh no, I can't believe. I've never been fired from a job. Here it comes, here it comes. How could this be?" And he said, "Okay, let's talk about this. So, did you follow the plan and the process that you've been trained and did you do what you're supposed to do?"... "Yeah, absolutely"... "Did you do the best you could on this deal?"... "Yeah, I put it all out there. I know I did that." He said, "Can you look back and potentially learn something from this?"... "Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about it and there was couple things that maybe I should have done differently."... "Did anyone die?" He said.... "No".

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.

Mary Peterson:
No one died.

Christine Laperriere:
No one died.

Mary Peterson:
He's like, "Okay, good. Get out of my office. Learn from this, pick yourself back up and go win some more deals based on what you learned."

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. I'm smiling from ear to ear because sometimes you don't need to be beat up. You're already beating yourself up enough.

Mary Peterson:
We do it enough to ourselves for sure. And this person was just the first time that I thought, "Oh, okay, chill out a little bit here. We can do this. But we got to learn from it." And I'm sure the conversation would be different the next time, if I made the same mistake, which is also part of this living in fear and making sure you can try things, you can be innovative, but if you make mistake, learn from it and don't do it twice is. That's what I've learned later in my career too. So, even currently at Samsung, where I'm in a leadership position, rolling out new products. Some of these products are out there, it's different, different market, whatever. I'm thinking about one in particular over the last couple of years and it's a different type of product.

Mary Peterson:
So my team and I, we decided, okay, we're going to go try this really different type of distribution channel for it. Seems it makes sense. It's a huge sales force that could represent this product. It's a compatible market that they're in. This could be really something, if this takes off, boom, because the breadth and the scale of this could be incredible. Of course, I've told the executives back at headquarters, all of this that were going after it. Well, we trained them. We set up promotions and incentives. We invested in marketing to support this thing and guess what? It didn't work. It didn't work.

Christine Laperriere:
And what did you learn?

Mary Peterson:
And that's exactly, we learned that they weren't able to push something new into the same stakeholders. They weren't talking to the right person, the market wasn't quite right on with us. There's a list of things that we've gone through to say, "What did we learn from it?" And as long as you do that, we won't do this again. We'll make other mistakes, but we won't do this again. There're even stories if you look back at famous inventors in this world, right? Like how many mistakes did they make before they made that one big invention. The point being, take that knowledge, learn from it and create an environment. So, in my case, I'm in an environment with bosses that allow that to happen. But, I also try to create that environment within my team to don't be afraid. It made sense. It was a great bet. Let's go through it.

Christine Laperriere:
I love hearing that because I've worked with companies where there's zero room for error or there's zero room for a mistake. And to your exact point, it really kills innovation. I can even think of a few that might not come out of the pandemic that well, just from really forcing people to be terrified of innovating, because innovating means you could fail. You will have spent money on something that didn't work. I think you're right. I think this idea around fear, especially in the technology space, the last thing you want is people to be limited in their thinking.

Mary Peterson:
And there are still bosses that do create that. Make that deal at all costs or else... Or okay, you can have that money but, it better work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. They don't want to take a chance on anything.

Mary Peterson:
I've also heard a term 'blame culture' too, which I think is part of that fear, right? You don't want to be the one, "Oh, that was the mistake Mary made" or "Mary made that and now we are all paying for it." You know what I mean? I just think fear and faith is such an important thing that I try to live with always. I can't live with fear.

Christine Laperriere:
So, what other things do you think of when you think of that best boss?

Mary Peterson:
Well, I also think about again, ambitious A type Mary. I was always going for that next thing. So, the way you get it is, you got to prove that you can do it or prove that you're the right person. So, I looked to a couple of bosses that supported me to put myself out there.

Mary Peterson:
So for example, one story in a previous employer where I was working in an area that was slightly different from the main business. So, they asked me to go in and talk to the senior executives, to some key stakeholders about doing this sort of leveraged business model in a very direct sales business world. And to propose that this would be a way for them to grow their business. So my boss came to me and said, "I'd like you to do this. A month from now, we'll book a meeting. We'll get all these people together and we'll present this plan. And again, it's off the side of your desk, because you're still busy doing whatever you have to do, but yeah, I'm all for it. Let's do it."

Mary Peterson:
So, I worked on this thing and I would take it to him and we would review it and get his feedback and we would work on it, work on, work on, and the day came and he says, "So, you're presenting it."... I'm like, "Oh, I thought you were and I would just be in the background."... He's like, "No, this is your plan, your idea, your work, you present it. I'll be in the room if you need me, but you're fine. Right?" And so off I went, little nervous in front of all these important people, but I done the work and I went out there and I pitched this plan and the meeting went well and afterwards the boss came to me and gave me all kinds of props, great job, excellent, et cetera, et cetera.

Mary Peterson:
And then he also told me, "Oh, by the way, so and so in the audience, the senior person, he sent me a text in the middle and saying, Mary is incredible." This is so great, blah, blah, blah and gave me this feedback. And so here I am sitting here, how many years later?, I don't even remember really what I pitched. I don't even really remember how much of it we did. But I remember how that elevated me, that I put myself out there. He gave me the opportunity to put myself out there, to challenge myself, to show everyone, to build my brand. He gave me of the opportunity to do all of that and be successful in a platform. He could have easily taken this and got the props himself. But he gave that to me. And so at the end of the day, I remember so and so that texted him about how awesome I was. I remember the feedback that he gave me. I don't even remember what we really talked about.

Christine Laperriere:
When I listened to that I'm grinning from ear to ear over here because one thing we don't think about is bolstering confidence. So, I hear not only were you given this great opportunity, which you totally deserved, but when you gain confidence in an environment, what you'll do next is even more powerful because you're not limited by your own internal voice of am I good enough? Am I smart enough? All of those things. And so that bolstering of your confidence is phenomenal.

Mary Peterson:
I agree. The layering of your career as you look back in your career and you say what were some of the turning points? And maybe that was a turning point that, "Yes, I can actually do this. And now I have the confidence and I'll do it again more often and it'll be more comfortable." And I think about that out as far as... There's often times and there's often organizations where we don't allow people to broaden their skills. They come in this job and they stay in that job. And when we go to hire something over here, "No, because she's that person, she's not good, she's really good at that." And I think that this example, but also earlier in my career and... I'll tell you Microsoft was really good at this. They would take high performers and move them into lateral roles, move them into different... They're a good salesperson, move them into a marketing role, move them into a services' role. And they would move, especially high performers around, to give them this rounded out. And I don't see that in enough organizations or enough bosses willing to do that.

Mary Peterson:
And one of my other examples about this was, and this is years ago, but I was in an individual contributor role at Microsoft, but it doesn't really matter. I was going on mat leave, which back then was only a six month leave, but I was going on mat leave and they said, "Okay, Mary, I want to give your job away. I want to hire somebody full time for your job because when you come back, I want to find you something better. So, do you trust me that I can go and back fill your job and trust me that I will bring you in at a higher level"... Because of course at that point I'm anxious to be a manager or whatever... "But I'll bring you in at a different role, a different level, and we'll move on from there"... Which again, showed sort of that boss and that environment, was all about creating opportunities to grow and develop and change and not while you're that thing. So we'll keep you in this thing and you will stay in that thing forever.

Christine Laperriere:
Again, like this is another moment where I'm just grinning from ear to ear because the number of women who apologize or feel nervous about leaving for mat leave. I know. I even did it during my first mat leave, I kept apologizing and I was scared of even trying to convince everybody that I could come back at the same level of performance. I wasn't even thinking about growth. I was just thinking, "Please, no, I'm not going to change."

Mary Peterson:
I'll be back. I'll be as keen as I ever was.

Christine Laperriere:
I think of how many people are nervous about when they leave. Will people view them as not being as high performing because they would've had this new life experience and they've been out of the office for six months and "behind", right. And I just think of all of that, that noise, and not only does it come from the outside and then obviously women internalize it. So, I listen to that and I go, "How cool is that?"

Mary Peterson:
And it's funny that if you and I are thinking about this, imagine how subconscious this is in so many places, but yeah, as far as the best boss and being able to create opportunities to develop and grow and challenge and change and lateral moves and all of those things that help us become better.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a really good point, he did not have a bias around maternity leave. As a matter of fact, almost did the exact opposite of what's instinctive. And I think that's kind of cool. You don't hear those stories as often. So, that's an interesting one. And like you said, lots of opportunity for you to grow. I'm sure you came back from mat leave feeling excited.

Mary Peterson:
I was so excited during that break about what the next things were. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Mary Peterson:
So a couple of other best bosses I'll talk about, one is just, again, she was a boss a long time ago, but I think if I look back on somebody that I still to this day and it's been years. I don't even want to say the number, but it's been years since she managed me. But I often think back to how she would handle it because I just thought that she was just the full package. And the main characteristics that bubbled up to me with her was she kept her cool. So, she was calm. She didn't flail, she was calm and cool. I watched her in situations once where a customer/partner treated her very poorly and yelling like it was... It was a really bad scene and she folded her book and walked out of the room. And I thought good for you. Who knows? It's okay if she went to her car and cried, who cares? Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. She had enough dignity to say, I won't be treated like this. Thank you.

Mary Peterson:
So, and then I would see her just in any situation, whether it was customer, with executives, with whatever, it was always that same calm equals confidence personality. Her communication, I still remember, it'd be like, "Okay, you guys come here. I got to talk to you about something, the three of you come here. Here's what we got to do." It was always that keeping us on point, communicating what we needed to know about what was happening in a dynamic environment. She was always good at those little updates, those little things to keep us, "Okay, we need to maybe turn a little bit, but let's keep going." That was another one of her things.

Mary Peterson:
And then building strategies. So, okay, this is the ambitious person being inspired by this. She was managing the business, running the business, but she always had those little side projects that she was working on and you'd talk to her and she'd be like, "Yes. One of the things I'm working on...", There was always a problem solving piece that she was working on. So it wasn't a matter of somebody come to her and say, "Okay, time now to figure out X, Y, and Z". It was more like she saw situations that could be improved or fixed. And then she was always kind of working on them. And the next thing you know, they'd bubble up and we'd be executing them, but you know what I mean?

Mary Peterson:
And so this is somebody that I still go back to, "Okay, what would she have done?" This is steady base and maybe that's what I needed. I needed the steady rock. I needed this rock to drive our business and lead our business while I was doing what I do. So, I think that was part of it too, to be that rock. She was that rock for me.

Christine Laperriere:
It's an interesting one because having done these interviews, that calm leader paired up with a very ambitious, maybe emotionally tied passionate person seems to be an interesting combination that I've now heard quite a few times where it's like, there's that leader that is the steady, just like you said the rock and keeps everybody like, "Hey, no one died. It's all good. Everything's going to work [inaudible 00:17:05]." And then meanwhile, you have this passionate high energy, high potential employee and they get to come in and be all those things, but balanced with that, calm, steady.

Mary Peterson:
Yeah. It's a good point. And now that I'm a leader, I have to remind myself of that because I know where I revert back to. I know I'm more emotional person and I need to remind myself of that sometimes. And I need to remind myself to be that rock for others. And I also have to remind myself that when I'm with another me, that we can spin each other out of control. So that's when I know when I'm with other 'mes', I need to be the rock.

Christine Laperriere:
The rock. Exactly.

Mary Peterson:
I have to get back to the rock at some point.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. Someone in the room has to be the rock. But I also love this proactive problem solving that she was doing off the side of her desk. And one thing I work with a lot of leaders who sometimes feel burnt out or they feel like they're not being used for their highest purpose, right? So managing a small team or rallying a small team is enjoyable, but when you've done it for a long time, it starts to lose some of its oomph. And so, I hear that proactive problem solving, I think that's a good example of a leader finding a way for her to stay motivated, like for her to stay inspired on the job.

Mary Peterson:
That might have been it, or it might have been the way she's going to be recognized and get ahead or could just be solve problems to solve. I'm not sure it was about keeping yourself busy in those days because it was kind of a crazy times, but still.

Christine Laperriere:
But given lots of energy and excitement sometimes around all those problem solving. So, that's cool. Those are fantastic stories.

Mary Peterson:
Well, I have one more and actually this one's on the same thing. It was the same company, different boss, also female, also calm and the rock. And I guess maybe that's what I gravitated to as far as strong leadership, especially when I was younger, but this boss had just the incredible ability to build strategy through and with the team. So, she was all about driving change, change leadership, doing new things, but she had this incredible ability to get everyone involved in building this. And I still think about it, some days I wish I could do this, but this ability to get a group of people together, start with the brainstorming, pick those key areas, start to move us forward, revisit it every couple of weeks with a group of people and be able to get to an incredibly great strategy and execution and drive some incredible change within the organization.

Mary Peterson:
And of course, if everyone's got their blood, sweat and tears in it, we're already bought in and it's going to happen. And there are times where it would be easier to go off and set this yourself than come to the team and execute together. But she had such an incredible job of building it with the others and then you've got the buy in and next thing you know, you're executing and her analogy she always used was getting on the bus. So, the process of getting, and I'm sure this is used by a lot of people, she probably didn't invent this, but I still, you use this all the time [inaudible 00:20:12] right. Just getting everyone on the bus, get them on the bus, then you're going to decide who's driving. Where are you sitting? How are you doing? Where are you going?

Mary Peterson:
Like we all are on the bus and we're figuring that out. And then we set the vision and we take off down the road. And there are times when some people are going to fall off the bus and we have to circle back up and pick them up because they didn't buy in. They don't agree. There're some problems we've encountered that we have to do it, but it's about setting the vision, sharing the vision, rules and responsibilities. Who's driving the bus, who's packing the bus, who's making sure there's gas in the bus. All of those things, rules and responsibility, so important to setting that up and then tracking the results. What's the map. Are we getting close to the right destination? Have we veered off course? Is everyone still on the bus? So, she would use that all the time, but she just had such a great ability to pull us all together and make this happen.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the analogy. We've heard the term, but actually it sounds even... it was used even more thoughtfully around strategy. It wasn't sometimes it's the cultural bust, but I'm hearing that it was also really used to the extent where we're trying to get to a destination and we're going to keep talking about it, right. And I think sometimes those models, when you think of how people's brains interpret information, would be so helpful, because not everybody has a strategic brain. And so I hear this sometimes where it's hard to get everybody aligned on strategy. This sounds like it was built for everybody to be included.

Mary Peterson:
She was incredible at doing that and pulling a lot of people together. The joke is, and I still stay in touch with her to this day, it'd be like, she's the friend you want to come over when you have to move your house or something too. Right? She pull it all together and get it done.

Christine Laperriere:
So, she would obviously bring everybody into the room and get them working on the strategy. But tell me even any specific tactics you saw her do that made it possible because I see leaders run sessions and they dominate the whole session.

Mary Peterson:
No, she would do it at the... She's very methodical, but she would get us in the room. I remember several examples. One time we were at her cottage and oftentimes it would be... You don't realize it's a burning platform yet. She's found this burning platform, so she's getting us all involved. So it's about brainstorming and what's important to pull forward. And then we take that or we take the three things that we pulled out of that. And then we go two weeks from now, the next degree together as a team, getting through. And along the way, there might be some takeaway or some follow up. But it's not everyone, "Okay, one to 10, everyone take a topic and come back and report to me." No, it would be if there's a subject matter expert that would take that off, otherwise no, it was... And oftentimes she would do a lot of the... "Okay, pulling it together to make it easier for us kind of thing."

Christine Laperriere:
Sounds like she has that ability to facilitate the conversation and make sure people feel included and then the strategic vision as well. So she knows where she's trying to get everybody in that session.

Mary Peterson:
And brain platform was also one of her taglines too. So it was like, we all needed to believe in this brain platform along the way too, which was part of keeping people on the bus. If you didn't believe on it, then let's go back. Let's circle around. What could we do to address this differently? Is this something we want to fix and change or build.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's a great example of getting strategic alignment and ownership. It's such a perfect example of that. I see so many leaders who set the strategy and then they talk, talk, talk it down into their team. Not that there's anything necessarily. That's the traditional way that it's done. But what I'm hearing here is she's not leaving the station unless everybody's on the bus.

Mary Peterson:
Exactly and so we were all on. So, by the time we were bringing this to mainstream, we all believed in it. We were all passionate about it. We'd all put our blood, sweat and tears into it. And we were going to make this happen versus the change that comes from above and is handed to you, sometimes doesn't... It takes more revs to get everyone bought in.

Christine Laperriere:
And we already know if you're not fully bought in, even if you're partially bought in, we don't put our blood, sweat and tears in the same way. So, if I signed up to get on that bus, I'm going to feel much different about the journey than if I got pushed into getting on the bus.

Mary Peterson:
Even if you're on the bus and you're not really sure where it's going, as long as you're there for the journey, even if you jump out then, "Well, okay, there's something wrong. Christine jumped out of the bus. Let's figure out why."

Christine Laperriere:
It's such a good a story. And it's really making me think a lot about the leaders that I work with who have important strategic outcomes they're trying to accomplish. And maybe the ways that they could approach that. Well, Mary, knowing that most of the listeners here are either ambitious types that are on their way to management. Or we have some folks that are in management who are ambitiously working to be amazing leaders. They're not settling for less. What would be any last words of wisdom or nuggets that you think could really help that audience along?

Mary Peterson:
I think going back to the things that I started with, first of all, I don't know, I call it faith, not fear or you can't live in fear. So, if you're in a situation where you're being forced to be in fear, there's something wrong with that. And that needs to be addressed either it's in you and your confidence and your ability to do something or it's being pressure put on you. And nothing good happens from that. We need to be confident and faithful, but I always think faith, not fear... We need to know that we can do this and we'll be all right. And nobody dies and nobody loses their job. And as long as you only do it once, make a mistake, break glass, try things, be curious, that's all part of this faith, not fear piece. Be curious, try new things, don't be fearful or you won't ever push the limits.

Title: Going on a mission to Mars
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jaime Moody

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the boss that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So, welcome, Jamie. Thank you so much for being on the show.

Jaime Moody:
Oh, it's great to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm so thrilled that you are on this show. When I think of really great guests to bring on, I love to go back and reflect on leaders that I've known throughout my career, and we got a chance to know each other through CEO Global as you were CEO of Tree of Life, and what I really admired was how many people respected and admired you. So, out of that group of a hundred CEOs and leaders, you were definitely one of the most admired leaders in that group. And so, for me, when I ask the question who's your best boss ever, I feel like I go after the ones who are already admired by their peers in that way.

Jaime Moody:
It's nice of you to say. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Do you want to do any other introduction just to get us started?

Jaime Moody:
Tree of Life has been my passion for these last 23 years, having been the president for about 18 of those years and now as vice chair, I'm just on the board and an advisor to the business, and having just hired a new president to take over and working with her. Her name is Lisa MacNeil and she is doing fabulous. Love having her on the team.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. That is excellent. So, then just diving in, I want to know who is your best boss ever, and why?

Jaime Moody:
I really come up with a lot of folks over the years, quite frankly, but there's two that really stand out, and it's been my most recent experience of these folks that I work with and for very different reasons. One was when I first came into this company and I just had someone I worked with and I came in sort of as a second in command, if you will, CFO, and the person I work with at the time had hired me. He just had an all-around knowledge of the business and was just so knowledgeable in just every facet of the business, and I just like the fact that you could take any sort of issue to him and have a discussion about it, and he would weigh in and not tell you what to do, of course, but he would weigh in and give you some things to think about. He very much let me do what I did and stayed out of my way.

Jaime Moody:
That's been mostly true in my career as I worked for people sort of let me do what I do and pretty much stayed out of my way or else I wouldn't have stayed, right, because that is the old adage, right? You don't quit a company. You quit the boss. That's almost always true, but you really just quit people who don't let you do what you do. And so, I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of people who let me do what I do. It's been fun.

Christine Laperriere:
So, when you think of that first boss that you had though, who it sounds like he was a mentor probably in some ways or his style was very mentoring, what happens if you were on the wrong track or if you were headed down the wrong path. How did he help bring you back?

Jaime Moody:
Frankly, he was just very direct, right? He just said, "We're off course here and we just need to get it back on course." Ultimately, there wasn't a lot of that, to be honest, in this particular situation. It just seemed to be a business that fit well with me and I fit well there and we were just able to achieve some good things, but that's the point. That's what mentorship's about is helping you setting out guidelines. I've always been a strong believer in setting goals and have alignment against goals and then being very pragmatic about how we cascade those goals within the organization and making sure there's no room for error or misjudgment. So, there's a lot of communication that has to go out along that way, and so he was good at that. We knew what we needed to accomplish together and what we needed to accomplish individually. So, it made for a good, healthy environment.

Christine Laperriere:
Did you find that you also got autonomy on how you worked and when you worked and some of those things once you had really good alignment on the outcome?

Jaime Moody:
Almost always had that, and that's a great part too. I've almost always had. I guess it's a part of I get to work when I want. Well, I worked a lot, so I guess that's when I wanted to. When you fill the day with work, and I always remember those feelings, when you're driving home from the office and it might be eight o'clock at night and you reflect back on what you've accomplished in the day, you feel good about it. I always good about that. I felt like I got a lot done and I would go back in the next day energized. So, that was a good thing.

Christine Laperriere:
And then who was that second boss that crossed your mind?

Jaime Moody:
Well, and that is the boss that worked [inaudible 00:04:31. Now, this gentleman runs an organization that has many billions of dollars. He's based in the US. 5,000 employees, et cetera, something like that. What really struck me was when they come in and bought our business and they bought it many, many years ago now, I remember having the first conversation with him just before they closed on the transaction. He came up to Toronto and we got together. He and the CFO of the organization came up. We met for dinner and drinks first, and as would be my norm, I start talking about the business, my love, my passion, and he said, "Well," he said, "I know about the business or at least I know enough today about the business. What I don't know is who you are, and what I really want to know is get to know you as a person."

Jaime Moody:
And that has always stayed with me since that day, right? It is about let's know each other as individuals. Let's know each other as people first, and then honor and respect everything that we are as people. The business is a part of who we are and what we do, of course, but first it's about who we are as people. What a delightful conversation it was.

Christine Laperriere:
Such a great point. So, as he's gotten to know you as a person, how does that shape how he works with you?

Jaime Moody:
I would have him come up to our annual sales and marketing meetings, and we give him a half an hour to talk to folks that people always want to know how it's going in the mothership and how the US is doing, and at the end of his address, he would always turn to me and he would say, "And Jamie, keep writing those checks." Right? Not that we ever sent them a check, but the reality is we were doing good things to the organization and the business was successful, and that's the way he just wanted to close his discussion with a little humor, obvious appreciation for what we do as an organization.

Jaime Moody:
Frankly, in the end, for the most part, I was not reporting to him, I was reporting to the CFO because when they bought the business, they really bought the business of our US parent company, and Canada was not an afterthought, but a throw in, was not strategic to their intent. But six months after the deal, he had me come down and speak to the board of directors and talk to the board about who we are and what we are and what our future prospects are. At that point, we were no longer for sale. As he said to me, he said, "Now that we've fallen in love with your business and we understand it better, and maybe you should report to me." And I said, "No, no. I like reporting to the CFO. He's a great guy. We're both learning from each other. He wants to do deals. I want to do deals." And so, we stayed that way. Since then, this fellow and I have become very close friends. We've done many vacations together. When we're away in vacation, we almost never talk business, but we know each other as people for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. It's such a good example though. Sometimes when I'm working with leaders, like you said, they jump to the business conversation first. We always want to be really efficient and really purposeful about time. I find that by nature we always jump in and talk shop right away, and I think it's interesting that he slowed you down and he prioritized getting to know you, almost with the assumption that if he got to know you, he'd be able to do business with you better.

Jaime Moody:
Absolutely. Absolutely right. And so, I've really tried to learn from that. I'm not good at it all the time. I sometimes get it right, but I always in the end find out more about people. This is not just some person who just shows up at your office every day. These are people who spend most of their waking hours with you, and so that's why I've always looked at that and said, "Let's build a family culture in the organization so that it becomes a fun place to come to." I've always enjoyed when I hear laughing in the outside or in the office or wherever, and I will sometimes in my management, my walking around, wander in to a group that's having some fun and I will have a laugh with them and just look at them and say, "Okay, permission to have fun."

Christine Laperriere:
Permission to have fun. This is kind of a nice segue. I'm curious, tell me a little bit more about the culture you created because I think people listening are going, "Oh, family culture? We're allowed to have fun?" Tell me more about that.

Jaime Moody:
It's really about purpose. We set out some years ago, maybe 11, 12 years ago, to create our own culture if you will, create a culture that was purposeful to what we could be or should be as opposed to that which just simply exists. So, we wanted to be a little bit of our own design, and I really wanted to be a values-based, performance-based culture. I think we had that, but they weren't well enunciated, and we have a quarterly meeting though, where we talk to all of our new folks. I used to fly across the country to do this with all our places across the country, but now it's easier because we do it virtually. But every quarter, we would sit and talk to everybody who's joined the organization last quarter and I would explain where the values came from.

Jaime Moody:
So, our purpose at Tree of Life is helping Canada eat well and live well, and it's a purpose that allows us to say what we do in terms of bringing great foods to Canadians. People are engaged by the culture. They understand it but that's not enough. I wanted to be values-based as well. So, we did an exercise. It's from Jim Collins back when he was, 1996, he wrote an article in Harvard Business Review how to bring values and purpose into your culture, and in there he described something called the mission of Mars.

Jaime Moody:
And the mission of Mars is something where you bring your people together and say, "Okay, here's the deal. I want you to think about this. We're going to have some people from Tree of Life go to Mars, and I want you to select who's going to go. Now, understand that it's not about that they speak Martian or that Martians speak English. We're just going to get to know each other through our observation and look at how we interact, right, and that we're just going to learn from each other. So, who do you want to send on that trip?" Pretty simple concept, right? And I said, "Bring three names."

Jaime Moody:
So, at the end, our management team got together. We had a two-day off-site. I think there was over 51 names on the board, but there was five names on the board that came up again and again. The discussion then turned. Well, let's brainstorm. Let's do some word mapping around why you picked these people, right, why these people were picked and what it is about them.

Jaime Moody:
And so, out of that came our values and our values are courage, accountability, improvement, balance, and excellence. They've been with us a long time, but that's what came out. We were able to put descriptors around what those words were. One day, our CEO said to me, he said, "Jamie, why is it that your values in Canada are different from those in the US?" And I said, "Well, because ours are made in Canada and they're from us. They're people. Right? They reflect who we are." He said, "Oh," because he thought maybe that our values should be the same as theirs, and I said, "Yeah." But he respects the fact that Canada is a distinct culture from the US, and he asked me how we process we did. So, they did the same thing in the US. They took a mission to Mars.

Christine Laperriere:
Did they come up with any similar values or were they completely unique?

Jaime Moody:
No, they're very similar. Quite frankly, our parent company is faith founded. Their purpose is serving and honoring God in everything we do. It's really about the golden rule of how we treat people. That's the commonality, if you will, as I interpret it. They have similar values around being humble, respectful, integrity. We tithe 10% of our earnings to help the less fortunate. So, that's how we honor our values. But people really get engaged I think by the fact that we have values. They really do drive what we do every day as a business, and our purpose certainly does that. Having a boss who allows you to do that is a very good thing. Bringing people along for the ride, when you do that is very engaging.

Christine Laperriere:
It's so interesting, and then I'm curious. So, when you see somebody in the organization that is not aligned to those values, help me understand what is it like to work in a very values-based organization, especially if somebody doesn't quite fit that mold.

Jaime Moody:
You have to make them real. Strategy is simple. Execution is difficult, right? This is just our strategy. We wanted to be purpose-driven and we wanted to be values-based. So, the execution of that is something that just means you got to live in every day. So, if you've got people that are offside, you bring them to the game. I always take the opposite view of things. There's an old adage in business, HR philosophy from years and years ago that you should treat everybody the same. I've never believed that. I think you should treat everybody great. And great to you and great to me are likely going to be two different things, right? So, people interpret these things differently, but what we tried to do is we've created awards, call them the LOV Awards, living our values. Every month we talk about people who are living our values. Every month we would talk about is there a situation that's risen in the last period that you've heard we are not living our values, and those are fruitful discussions. They don't come up often, but when they do, they're great discussions.

Christine Laperriere:
When are things in conflict with those values most often? I'm just curious. When do you notice there's actually sometimes a conflict with the values?

Jaime Moody:
Not very often do you think that you find things that are in conflict with the values. I've never believed in mission statements. I think they're worthless. They're usually just words that say, "We're going to be the best." Well, that doesn't tell you how you're going to be the best. I've always loved these statements that FedEx has, for example, is 9:00 AM next day guaranteed. Right? Simple. Everybody understands what it is. Everybody's job is that. Right?

Jaime Moody:
Helping Canada eat well and live well is our purpose statement. I put a goal statement to that, and I call them Jamie's forever goals, likely because we'll never get there, but we should forever be pursuing them. And I always make a joke about that, they're forever goals because just for that reason, but they are that we want this to be the best place to work, and we want every customer and client experience to be a great experience. It just rolls out off the tongue, and that comes back to me all the time when I was running the business. But if we're going to make this the best place to work, then what about this? If we're going to make that a great client experience or a customer experience, what about this?

Christine Laperriere:
That resonates with me. Right off the bat, I'm thinking to myself how much that would shape the way you make decisions every day. Those tiny, little micro-decisions, you can always bounce it off of a forever goal.

Jaime Moody:
The hardest value that we have is called work-life balance. My definition of work-life balance is understandably different from someone else's, and as people deal with that, they say, "You're not living up to your balance statement. You're not living to that value." Right? And I said, "You're right." It's the hardest thing to deal with, as I say. It's different for everybody. But just think about it this way. If that wasn't one of our values, how bad do you think it would be? It makes us think about it. It's driven our benefit plans. It's driven some of the flexibility we have around our work schedule. It's driven the fact that we are a family. We get that, and if there's a sick child at home, please deal with it.

Christine Laperriere:
I've actually coined the phrase work-life wisdom because I call it, it's custom for each one of us. So, my wisdom is exiting at 5:30 so I can spend quality time with my three and five-year-old. But your wisdom may be different. You know what I mean? You might choose to have dinner at seven o'clock at night, or make sure that you get time with the cats. It can be a very different version of what your wisdom is that tells you what you need to stay resilient.

Jaime Moody:
That's exactly right and that's precisely the point. If you want people to be engaged in what you do every day, you have to treat them as humans. You have to give them some flexibility, right? You have to treat them in the way you'd like to be treated.

Christine Laperriere:
It is amazing how these all sound so simple, but in reality, for some reason, they're not. I'm talking to a leader today whose boss wants her in the office at 7:00 AM working on something that he believes is time sensitive, and it's just so interesting when I think of how many leaders have lost sight of that, that it sounds obvious, but it's not.

Jaime Moody:
Yeah, and the way I've always dealt with that is to think about there's always things you need to get done. You have to have a performance culture. One of the best ways to drive performance is by putting milestones and deadlines in place. The times when you are the most productive ever is the week before vacation, or when you have a deadline. Just sometimes I would put artificial deadlines in place. Yes, I want to get things done, and I would always ask a person, "When do you think you can have that done by?" I may be thinking three weeks is great. They are almost inevitably going to say something less than three weeks, and we end up something in between probably. So, allowing people to set their own deadlines, which is what my bosses have done for me, right, has been a great learning experience for me. It will get done. It will get done in that timeframe, and it will get done right.

Christine Laperriere:
So, tell me about your worst boss.

Jaime Moody:
I haven't had a lot of them, for one, but I guess I should call it the guy who fired me as my worst boss. I was working for a company that, well, it was one of those companies when you walk in, it was too good to be true. When I looked at the financial statements, all it was good, but when I actually got inside the doors, I saw that they were basically insolvent. The good news is we figured out a way to get us out of that situation, and I was a big part of why that got figured out, I would say. But one, day he came into my office and he fired me on the spot and he didn't tell me why, and I had really no idea why. I found out later that some people had positioned me as that I should be taking over the business, and it was his private business. I mean, it was never even in the scope of my mind that I would do that.

Jaime Moody:
So, in the end, it wasn't a great experience, but through the process, spent about two years there. We took a business that was basically insolvent and turned it around and got it fixed and put it in a good place. And if there's ever a way that for young people, as they're starting in their career and they're in a crisis situation learning how to sail a ship when the ship is on fire is a great experience. It's not fun while you're there, but it's a great learning experience, and it is the baptism on fire.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is an excellent piece of wisdom right there too. I think of different situations that I've been in where it's extremely challenging. To your point, they're the biggest education.

Jaime Moody:
Anybody can sell a ship in smooth seas as they often say.

Christine Laperriere:
So, knowing that this show gets a lot of listens from people who are entering into leadership, are currently in leadership and/or ones who are trying to be better leaders, just share with me kind of... I think you probably have hours of words of wisdom, but as many things as you can that they need to hear right now.

Jaime Moody:
Well, the best leaders I've worked for there has been a common bound and that's been that they love to learn, and they want you to learn. As you think about your career, as we talked a little bit earlier about being purposeful about your career, part of being purposeful is making sure that you're learning everything you can along the way, right? That's going to prepare you for your next role, whether it's in the current organization or whether it's outside the current organization, but as long as you're learning every piece, then you're in a good place.

Jaime Moody:
And look for a boss who is a lifelong learner, and that's how you're going to be able to lead people and have a successful career, by learning as much as you can along the way. Being part of the CEO Global network as you and I were, it's just a hot bed for learning. It's what we do, right? We help each other, and with problems that we have that are often a similar but different problem that we have each other, the perspectives you get from being able to talk to other people about it and the learning you get from that is just fantastic.

Jaime Moody:
So, that is the other thing for a young leader. Get a mentor. Get somebody you can speak to and maybe in the same organization, but perhaps not. I've done some mentoring of some people from other organizations, and I've learned a lot from them as well. I love mentoring a younger person because how much do I learn from a younger person, right? It's fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
Keeps your mindset valuable and flexible too, right?

Jaime Moody:
Precisely. The thoughts of a younger consumer are quite a bit different from where I'm thinking, not to mention the challenges we have around technology and how much fun we have with that. I quite enjoy technology and bound and determine not to be a dinosaur because I love this stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
But I bet that mentoring of youth, again, you have so much wisdom to share. They're keeping you young and thinking about different age groups and the way different brains operate. So, that's kind of a win-win for everybody.

Jaime Moody:
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, Jamie, thank you so much. Like I said, I'd love to pick your brain for hours. Maybe we'll have to have you on again. So, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Jaime Moody:
Been great, Christine. Very nice talking to you.

Title: Leaving a legacy
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Suzanne Roy

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome to the Best Boss Ever. And today I have Suzanne Roy on with me from McCormick. Suzanne, hello.

Suzanne Roy:
Hi there, Christine. Great to see you. Thank you for having me on the show.

Christine Laperriere:
I've had the luxury of working with you for over 10 years now and watching you as a leader just bloom through the years. So it's a really special thing to get a chance to have this conversation today. And I also know who one of the best bosses ever that you've worked for is. I have a massive, massive amount of respect for her, so I couldn't help but bring this topic forward today. So, Suzanne, please introduce yourself first.

Suzanne Roy:
Hi everybody. My name is Suzanne Roy and I'm the Vice President of Sales and Marketing for McCormick & Company. And I am based at headquarters in Maryland in the US.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. I know today's topic's going to be a bit emotional, but can you tell us who your best boss ever is?

Suzanne Roy:
Actually I can, and I have to say this is a real honor. So my best boss ever was Megan Ford, who actually was my boss for almost the last, I would say, eight years. Unfortunately, we lost Megan a couple of months ago. So this just means the world to be able to honor and kind of remember why we were all so attached, actually so inspired by her leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. Can you tell me some of the great qualities of Megan?

Suzanne Roy:
Absolutely. I remember the first time I met Megan, there was an ease about her. Although she was a woman leader and an important leader for our organization and she could have been intimidating, but she just wasn't. She had this warmth about her. She had this inviting nature about her. And I think the thing for me that marked me the most over the years was her generosity of herself and her time. And that just allowed her to have an impact so much broader than what many leaders will have a chance to have in their career.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's amazing when you talk about her, those qualities strike me because in my time working with McCormick, I had just a few interactions with her, but that was exactly the impression. It was like, she was just so generous and she's so senior then. I was always very intimidated when I walked in the door. And then within a couple seconds, I'd calm right down.

Suzanne Roy:
Yep. That describes Megan.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Can you tell us some more examples and qualities, things you've grown to admire in her?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah, I think... And again, I mean, I had the pleasure of seeing Megan also grow as a leader throughout her career. So from a Vice President to really stepping out of our business for a period of time and then really being the first woman President of our US business. What I really saw was that Megan, over the years, just grew in confidence and in presence. She found the way to simplify the way that she talked about our business. And when you think about the B2B business that she led in a pretty large CPG company, her ability to simplify, teach and attract talent because of the passion that she had for it. She just had a way of being able to demystify and simplify to the easiest denominator for people to be able to grasp what our business was really about and how it was different.

Christine Laperriere:
She could distill it down to the simplest terms, help bring people on board?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah. And she could. I mean, we talk a lot about storytelling, but I think she had a way of giving you examples that were both easy to understand, but very, very relatable, which I think just, again, just allowed for us to get much better oversight.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of a specific time when you were talking to her about something tough and how she guided you through that?

Suzanne Roy:
I mean, over the years, every business goes through its challenges. And when we face some really hard times, sometimes where we didn't necessarily have our entire business being as efficient and as effective and have the optimal service agenda and really deliverables. And she would have a way of allowing you to realize that everything was about the journey. She would walk you through the fact that this was a marathon in order to really transform and make progress that things need to be done in stages. And that you needed to have patience because that is the way that you had the ability to really get traction. And I think she allowed you the opportunity to express your frustration, but she also gave you the opportunity to walk out of a conversation feeling more confident and reminding you of why she was confident that we would be in a position to make progress. And you always, at least I have to say for me personally, I always walked out of a conversation feeling more uplifted than I did when I walked in. And to me, that's an incredible trait for a leader.

Christine Laperriere:
That is an incredible trait when I think of a best boss, the ability to uplift people when they feel stuck or they feel frustrated or they feel impatient. All of those feelings can become quite toxic if nobody actually leads in that moment. Right?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah, absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm just kind of curious, when you think of leadership and what you've seen, what's the impact of having a best boss in a role like that? People question, what does that do to the bottom line? How does that impact the results?

Suzanne Roy:
A lot of companies talk about engagement and how engaged employees will drive a higher level of efficiency. And I would even say of performance. And I think having a best boss does that. But it does it in a way that allows you to remember the people aspect of leadership and not just the results that are expected of a leader. And I think Megan had just a remarkable balance between those two. You never felt as if the performance would come ahead of the people. And I think that made you want to work even harder on her behalf and wanted you to kind of follow her because of the passion that she had and her ability to maneuver the balance of people and performance.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, if you were to just kind of summarize. I know that there's some incredible work that you're doing on the behalf of marking her legacy. Can you just tell us a little bit about that?

Suzanne Roy:
I think what marked me the most when Megan was recognized at her funeral was actually her husband who asked everybody to pay it forward. And for me, that really made an impression on me. And I have to say there is not an interaction at work today where I don't think of whether or not I have left the person that I've just interacted with in a better or a worse place. And if I have the ability of getting people to feel better after an interaction, to me, that is the best recognition of just the sheer aura that she had the ability to have over this organization and her team. And it allows me to make sure that I keep part of her.

Suzanne Roy:
The other thing, for me, that I continue to think about when I'm in situations that are probably challenging is I take a step back, and this might sound really cliché, but I think about what would Megan do. And it often helps me affirm what my intuition is, because it's not always easy, especially when you're being tested in new roles and so on. But for me, it gives me the confidence to take a step back and just kind of use that as a benchmark. Not that I'm trying to emulate, but I sure want to have the opportunity to be able to inspire and make sure that this has not happened in vain. And that, for me, is important.

Christine Laperriere:
And I mean, one thing I'll just say kind of given that I knew her as well, she was taken too soon and we all agree with that. And it was very surprising. I feel like the first thought I had is what do you want people to say if something like that happens? If you're gone tomorrow, what do you want people to say about you? And I feel like everybody, what they say about Megan is just so beautiful that I think to myself, what a life well lived. If that's the impact that you left, how beautiful is that?

Suzanne Roy:
What I think is the other amazing thing is at any point you can look her around at least her segment and you can see the people that she brought over to our part of the business. And this was not, again, I mean, Flavor Solutions was not always the place where everybody wanted to migrate to. But I think the passion that she had and exuded and expressed for it, we can look around the room and wink and know and nudge that we were selected by her to be part of her group. And that, for me, is a legacy that is incredible. And she continues to bring people together, although she's not necessarily doing it with us on a day-to-day basis, which I think is an incredible memory about what she did so well.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. I know that this shaped you, this experience shaped you. If you were going to bring on a brand new leader and start to mentor them and take what you've learned from this experience and try to integrate it into the way that you mentor or help bring up future leaders. What are some of the things that you would tell them, or what's some of the pieces of wisdom that you would suggest?

Suzanne Roy:
Never let performance come ahead of the people, would be one of them. If you had good news or bad news, would you want to be the kind of person that you would want to share it with? And I think the ability for people to know that they can do it in either situations, I think is really important for new bosses and new leaders. I would say, be mindful of whether or not you build confidence and build trust and build credibility in the people that you engage with. Because I feel like as a leader, you do that through transparency and honesty, but you also do that with allowing people the freedom and the opportunity to prove themselves. And I think it's such an important trait for a leader to make sure that people feel uplifted and stronger because they know that they have your support. To me, these would be the three things that I think really have changed the way that I think about leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
It sounds like she didn't need to use status to gain respect.

Suzanne Roy:
No, never. The other part for me was consistency. Consistency and availability, I think are two other attributes that I think are really important. I think consistency was no matter who she engaged with, she was always consistent. She was always authentic. And you could see that whether she was engaging with interns that were coming into our company, or whether she was engaging with the CEO of a company or the CEO of her own company, she was very consistent. And, again, I think that builds trust and credibility. I think that is one of the most endearing and important attributes, especially for people that are customer facing. I think that was the other element.

Suzanne Roy:
And I think the generosity aspect of her time made it that if she thought that you needed her, she never made you feel like it was after hours. She never made you feel like it was before hours. She just, again, had this generosity of her time that despite how busy she was, you always knew that if you needed to get ahold of her, you could. What I also loved about Megan's demeanor was Megan was not high maintenance. In its simplest form, someone that could just go with whatever. And I think, especially as younger talent and new leader, you're already stressed enough trying to do what you need to do. And of course you continuously try to please and make an impression on your boss. She just allowed you to not have that pressure.

Suzanne Roy:
And I had another boss who had also that kind of demeanor, where it was just kind of a listen, these things happen or we'd be traveling together. She would not be the one that would be sitting in a different spot. She would actually be the one that would be in the back of the plane and nothing was a big deal. And that, to me, spoke a lot about the demeanor with which she did business. And I think as a boss, it kind of went completely against so many stereotypes we've got about what bosses are like. And I absolutely love that. And, again, for me, it made an impression on me without a doubt.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that. That is so good. That is so good. That's such a good point. And you brought up the idea of how she contradicted stereotypes of bosses. That makes an impact on me.

Suzanne Roy:
I think that the other piece, the difference that I also saw was this love to win. I mean, there's no question about it. She had a love to win. I mean, failure was not an option and that was in our business and that was with our customers. But it never came at the expense or in a way that made you feel like that was more important than anything else. And I think that, again, was just a really good example of how you can win, but it doesn't have to come at the expense of anything.

Christine Laperriere:
She liked to win when it was a win for everyone.

Suzanne Roy:
She loved to win. She was a master negotiator like no other. And she did it in a way that left both parties just feeling really good. And, again, it may sound like don't get me wrong, Megan grew into that role in a way that just made such an impression. And for me, those are the things that have honestly made a difference in the way that I lead and the way that I interact with people today. That's my honor to her.

Christine Laperriere:
Hearing about this gave me a lot of pause because of how many years I've heard people speak. I've coached everybody that worked for her and the way people talk about their bosses or their boss's bosses, it tells you so much about a person. So even though I didn't interact with her often, there was so much that I gathered just from the way people talked about her candidly behind the scenes. And so I had a massive amount of respect for her. People don't come into a coaching conversation and speak candidly and still say very respectful things that their bosses and their boss's bosses.

Suzanne Roy:
And you know what? She was good, but she worked at it. Again, let's not kid ourselves. This was not an easy... It's not as if everything came necessarily without work. I think she naturally had an ability to engage with people and to be generous with her time. And that was very important to her. But I mean, she worked at it and she worked at it constantly and continuously. And I think, again, that says a lot about how she progressed as a leader through the organization. And I still remember my first and my last interaction with her. That's just the journey that she did that I always paid attention to.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you tell us about the first and the last interaction?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah, the first interaction I was still in Canada. She was leading one of our largest customers and she was actually battling her first round of breast cancer. And she had this beautiful silk scarf on her head. And, again, this generosity of time. She just gave me the advice as I was starting to interact with the US group about kind of what to think about. And she took the time to understand why I felt like what I wanted to share with her was important. I just felt like, again, what I had shared with her really mattered. And I think that was amazing. And here's the funny thing, my last interaction with her was on the same tone, but almost 12 years later. And it was her sharing just what she aspired for me and what she had planned for me. The fact that I had a chance to hear that from her, I feel like was almost kind of the beginning and the closure of her ability to influence my career. That really meant a lot. I think about it every day.

Christine Laperriere:
That is absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much, Suzanne, for a phenomenal interview. I know this was an emotional one. Again, we need to bring these leaders and help share their legacies with everybody. So thank you for taking the time. And I know it was a tough conversation, but thank you.

Suzanne Roy:
Thank you so much. This was an honor. It meant a lot.

Title: What have you done for YOU lately?
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Kerri-Ann Santaguida

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had.

Christine Laperriere:
So we're back with the Best Boss Ever show and I'm so excited for my guest today, Kerri-Ann. Thanks so much for joining me.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
So Kerri-Ann, just do a quick introduction so everybody gets to know who you.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Sure. Thank you. So I'm Kerri-Ann Santaguida. I work at American Express. I'm coming up on 20 years this coming January of 2022. I will have been here 20 years and just had an amazing career here in terms of advancement and opportunity. I currently lead the merchant services. I'm the head of merchant services for Canada, so the acquiring business here in Canada, and just have a really exciting job.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. I'm so excited that you joined me because we had an opportunity to work together a couple years ago, as we were featuring some great female leaders in different ... I think it was financial services businesses and some consumer package businesses. So it's really neat that I get a chance to interview on this topic.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I'm thrilled to be here and we had a great time then, and I'm sure we will today as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So who is your best boss ever, and why?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
That is such a reflective question. I have to say when you reached out and asked me if I would join you today, I really took the time to think about that because there's been ... I'm fortunate. I work for an organization who just has a strong culture of amazing leaders. If I reflect back on my best bosses, both of them are here at American Express or were here at American Express at some point in their career. I really have to say that it's interesting. It's a reflection of what does it mean to be the best boss and what are those traits that I look for in a leader who's been memorable to me, and really it's those that have had an impact on my own growth and development over the course of my career. What's really interesting about both these leaders is there's two actually that we're going to talk about.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
They're very different in terms of their styles, but the leaders that I've learned from most over the years are those who have challenged me. My story really starts with American Express. So I joined American Express in January of 2002, and I went off on maternity leave on September 26th, 2002. So nine months after joining this company, I went off to have my first child and I disclosed it upfront to them, said I was expecting when I was in the process with them. They said to me, "Okay, we're investing in you long term, not short term, so come on board." That was my first experience with the company where I was like, "Okay, this is a special place," and that was a very authentic answer that I'd gotten from that leader in that moment in time.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
You fast forward three years later, I'm about to go on maternity leave having my second child, I just won two President's Club awards for my performance as an individual contributor over time, I'd moved into a leadership role and that's when one of my best bosses ever came into the picture and his name is Andy Pilkington.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So Andy is now EVP at the TD Bank, but he is truly this person who took a chance on me. He saw the ambition in me, he opened the door for me to accelerate my career and our story is an interesting one because you know, he promoted me while I was on maternity leave for my second child.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So he called me because a role became available, a director role, and he said, "I think you'd be great for this. I know you've just left. You've just had your second child," and I had just had her. Two or three days after I'd had her, he called to congratulate and he said, "Hey, this happened and we'd really like you to consider this role." So he promoted me while I was on maternity leave. I went through this really quick little process, suddenly I was promoted. I said to him, "Look, I want to be off on mat leave," and he not ask me to come back early. He left that in my decision to make, and then while I was off on mat leave, so two kids, a three year old, a three month old, and he said to me, "This is your role. It's there for whenever you want to come back, you go and just enjoy being a mom right now." So that was an amazing feeling, because anyone who's ever had to think about going off on maternity leave, that's a worrisome time. You're worried about so many different aspects of things.

Christine Laperriere:
I just have to add for my American listeners, Canadian mat leave is one year.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
So this isn't a six week permission. This is a year of you being away from a leadership role.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
100%. That's exactly right, and he was not asking me to shorten it. In the end, I did shorten it, but that was my choice. It was not something that they were asking or he was asking me to do. But another thing happened though, while I was off on mat leave, we went through a really challenging time with my husband's health and he was suddenly diagnosed with a very serious illness. When I had to make the call to Andy to let him know that this is what we were dealing with and for me it was about I had made a commitment, I was going to take on a new leadership role, I was going to move into the organization from a completely different part of the business that I was in before and it had already been announced, and then I said, "Okay, now I'm dealing with this."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
He took the time, A, to understand what I was dealing with and then again say to me, "You do not need to worry about it. This job is here for you when you are ready to come back. You need to go and be the strength that you need to be for your family." Fortunately, our situation from a home perspective turned out well, but it was a super trying time in our life. It stretched me as a mom, as a wife, a leader and it really gave me this opportunity to reflect on what was important to me. I came back from a position of strength because of the things he said and did for me during my transition back in. One of the very first things he did for me was he said, "Okay, we need to put taking care of you on your development plan."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So brand new leader, newly promoted, we put on my development plan, "Taking care of me." He said, "What are the things that you're not getting to do given all of the responsibilities you have at the moment?" One of them was working out, for example. I had to take care of myself and he said, "Your family needs you to be strong. If that's really important to you, let's just work it into your calendar that you'll leave the office at three o'clock every day and you'll go work out at Good Life Fitness, and then you'll come back online when you're ready. You'll manage that." I mean, that's pretty profound when you think about a business area, that's saying, "Put your workout schedule and taking care of you on your own development plan for work."

Christine Laperriere:
I'm just floored over here. I absolutely am. I'm just like, "That is fantastic."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It is. It was a fantastic moment. I realized all these years later he was really just allowing me to be my best self and my best self was all different aspects of me and that's where he brought out the thoughtfulness about recognizing that in the grand scheme of having young kids and managing a very stressful situation and being there to support my husband's health, that I was the one that was being deprioritized in all of that, which makes sense in those moments. But there's so much more to Andy than just a moment like that. He is a networker extraordinaire. I learned that through my career. I am an introvert. I am a learned extrovert for my job and networking is not something that is natural to me, but the techniques and the approach that he takes to networking, I truly believe resonates with people.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It's not only about for his own empowerment and his own expansion of network. It's about the networks that he's creating and he's touching as he goes. He's a very humorous, happy, joyful person to be around and so he brings humor to the table, but he's also a very caring leader. If I think about him from a networking point of view, it wasn't unusual for him to just work the entire time he was heading up to his cottage. He'd be on the phone, just calling random people, checking in on teams, checking in on projects. It wasn't formal, it was casual, but it was meaningful and it really made a difference in someone's life in that moment. I really think that the networking point of view of a senior leader who can get that personal with individuals, it allows you to go the extra mile for a leader like that.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
You want to be able to be engaged and receive that call or be okay to make that call to him. There was always this open door policy that you were always able to leverage. So I think that that's pretty extraordinary as well. If I think about him from a position of what did I really learn from him and what do I take from every single interaction that I have with members of my team today, I think he allowed me to showcase my resilience. There have been different points in my career and in my home life where resilience was really important. We didn't actually talk about that very much in the early days of my career, and I don't mean me with him. I mean, in general people didn't speak about resilience as a strength, but it really truly was a strength of mine and it was something that I continue to be proud of today.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
But I never spoke about it as a strength. I wouldn't get into an interview situation or speaking at an event about resilience in the very early days of my career, the way I to totally would now. He said, "Highlight it as a strength. This is a strength of yours. You should speak about it from a part of your whole self. Resilience is something that we look for in really successful colleagues with American Express, as an example." I think that that's an important call out. He's sort of evolved that thinking around resilience as a strength and us being comfortable talking about it.

Christine Laperriere:
He was doing this 20 years ago when it wasn't mainstream.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Right. Exactly. That's exactly it.

Christine Laperriere:
Which must have even felt even more interesting because you're probably looking around and talking to other people in other careers and having other bosses and you're thinking, "Wow, mine really is a best boss."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
That's exactly right. He's somebody that I've continued to look towards for advice over my career. There's another piece of advice he gave me after he left that I use in all my mentoring discussions with everyone I have the good fortune of mentoring or sponsoring. He said to me, "Each move that you make in your career should further expand your resume. Take stock of your resume, have a look at it. Is your next role going to grow and develop you and is it going to make you more marketable internally and externally?" I think that that's really good advice. I mean, I think we think about it from a growth and development point of view, but I don't think we put it together in the holistic picture of what does our experience look like and what do we want our experience to be?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I use that to this day with everyone that I mentor and their reaction is the same as my reaction would've been. I was at a crossroads thinking about an opportunity. I thought it was kind of similar to what I was doing and it was Andy who gave me this advice. As I stepped back and I thought about it, I'm like, "Yeah, he's right. This is going to continue to expand my career. It will make me more marketable internally because of the skills I've gained, and externally." If I hadn't had that discussion with him, I probably wouldn't have taken that lateral move. That moment in time. It's really brought my career forward in a different way. So it's interesting how one conversation, one piece of advice, can change the way you look at something.

Christine Laperriere:
Especially from somebody you respect and admire who you know is there to give you good counsel for you. I have a question about Andy. Do you think he lived ... when I hear him asking you to take care of you, did he take care of him? From a resilience perspective, did he invest in his own health and wellness to be the leader that you needed?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Yeah, I think he definitely did. I think it was different depending on the moment of time and what was happening either in the business or in his own personal life, but absolutely I think he did, and he still does, based on my impression of it. Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
It's great to hear too. Some leaders will give really good advice and then they have a hard time living that same advice. So I always kind of have to ask the question, was he able to balance both?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Absolutely. Without a doubt.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm a big of Andy now.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
You mentioned two leaders.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I did, yes. So that takes me to the second leader. His name is Anré Williams. He still works at American Express. He's currently the CEO of American Express National Bank and group president of Enterprise Services. Now I never reported directly to Anré, but what I would say is I've always worked in his organizations and I've always had to be accountable based on all the roles that I had for the market under the different markets that he managed. He is somebody that I have learned my entire career from and continue to this day. So the learning isn't over, but we're in the middle of a learning journey. What I would say about him is he has shaped how I think about different aspects of my own leadership style. So he's a very principled and a very fair leader. He has conviction and he takes a very disciplined approach and principle based approach to how he runs the business, how he makes decisions.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
The important thing about this is that's how you stay out of hot water. With principle based decision-making, you truly have a defendable and clear approach to how and why you made a decision. I think that that is something that I continue to use today. Even as soon as a few days ago, I had to think about a new structure and a new decision-making methodology. The first thing I said to the team is it's going to be principle based, so let's collectively come together and figure out what the principle based approach would be. That was exactly his MO, that is how he does it and that is how I've deployed it with my team. I think it's really important because the other thing about the way that he leads is he champions the voice at the table.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So everyone has a voice at the table and that's very much how I would lead today. But he was always very clear on who's the decision maker and once the decision's made, we're all moving forward. So there wasn't these shades of gray that allowed you to think about, "Well, did we really make the decision?" Is it really ..." No, the decision is made whoever the decision maker was and it wasn't always him, but whoever the decision maker was, decision made, let's move forward. You can do that when you take this really disciplined principle-based approach and I think that that is something I truly respect in the way he leads.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
He also taught me the importance of data. I'm a salesperson by nature. I'm a relationship builder. Business development is part of what my team does, but data plays a really important role and I'm not necessarily an individual who is a very data driven person. I've now learned to use data as a mechanism to further the business and also to support decisions I'm making or to think about innovative decisions that I want to come across and sort of deliver within my organization. I can do that with data and that's something that I've learned on how he uses data and how I've now transitioned that into my own style of how I bring things forward.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Then the last thing I would say about him is clarity. He just brings clarity to each situation. He's got clear vision, he brings such clarity. So for us, as an example, in one of the lines of businesses I've worked for him, he always had these five areas of focus and everyone could repeat the five areas of focus, and this is something that allows the entire organization to get behind and have clarity. So the way he communicated it just allowed us to all understand exactly where the priorities and the focus needed to be.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
But you always knew where you stood with him because he had such clarity and I could have debates with him privately one on one, I could challenge the status quo and he would always come back with great response on why or why not. We could continue to think about the innovation that was coming forward and he respected your ... and he continues to respect your point of view and he would take it away and think about it, because he was open to new ideas. Often you can get in conversations with a senior leader where there's not a willingness or openness to debate at the table. That is something that I respect in the fact that he very much had an open opinion to that type of thing and would consider it.

Christine Laperriere:
So he encouraged diversity of thought. He actually encouraged different ideas, but then it sounds like he was a good decision-maker too.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Absolutely. Decisive, good decision-maker. There are very different leaders in terms of the way they approach the business, but they had common traits that have made them both successful in their own ways. They've moved up their ranks within their own organization. But one thing that they had in common was they were both really ambitious for me. So they both believed in me, they recognized my results and my contributions and they took the time to understand my values. I'm a very values driven person. So in getting to know me personally and understanding my values and respecting my values, that helped sort of evolve the career perspectives that I was willing to take a chance on or that I wanted. Ultimately in their own unique ways, they've really helped me have my own philosophy and thinking about career advancement and about the way that I mentor and interact with others.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
This is your own unique journey and you really need to be an active participant in it in your own career and you need to be the CEO of you. Ultimately it was my experience with both of them that helped me get to the, "You need to be the CEO of you," and just go for it and not be afraid of your ambition.

Christine Laperriere:
That is amazing. So in my world where you're looking at leaders and how you develop leaders, I guess we're always asking for what's the return on investment. People want to know if they invest $100,000 in their leaders, are they going to get that return on investment to the business and the metrics? That's a very subjective, difficult thing to untangle. Could you give me a guesstimate of what the impact of these two leaders? What's the impact to the business?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I'm going to give it not in dollars. I'm going to give it in legacy. I mean, the fact that they've both built businesses that have allowed them to put the building box in place for others either to step into or continue with. I think foundational is sort of how I would say. There's both foundational and very specifically from an Anré point of view, probably based on the time he's been at American Express, there's these building blocks and foundational pieces that are set that have just continued to return the investment twofold, both from an innovation point of view, I think from a colleague point of view, like investment in talent. I think about it in customer relationships. You can't actually put a dollar figure on the ROI that comes out of that because that is really just legacy I think, when you think about it from that point of view.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
The fact that the business has grown so significantly under the leadership just speaks overall to the performance of the company. When you're in a top role with a major corporation, the ROI is just all there, but it's like human capital. It's not just about the shareholder point of view. It's about the colleague point of view, the customer point of view, deep relationships. It's significant for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
It's always so hard to nail the that down, but I love the list that you gave. This is, I guess, what my point is. It impacts everything.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It does, and it's culture, right? So it's about everything. Then that culture resonates internally and externally. To work for leaders like that, I mean, I get up every a day inspired. I think about it from my Andy days and working in Anré's organizations, those are days that you feel inspired. You get out of bed, you know exactly what you want to do and there's a spring in your step, even though you're dealing with a one month old and a three year old and critical illness in the moment. But you still rise to the occasion and it's because there's this belief in you and hat's culture, that's caring, that's the power of connection.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and one thing that would've had to happen when you had all that support from, let's use Andy in the example, is that you wouldn't have been leading out of fear of losing your job during that time. You wouldn't have been leading thinking to myself, "Oh my gosh, all these things are going on. I bet everybody thinks I'm not performing." Because I mean, obviously I've worked with clients who are in that head space when there's so much going on at home, they're just fearful of what everybody thinks, which isn't a good leadership mindset.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Absolutely not. No. I didn't have that at all. I had support and encouragement. I basically had anything I needed to be able to make me successful, whether it was a day off to be able to go deal with something, whether it was permission to not attend a meeting because I needed to be in a different appointment. It was as long as you're not taking that to the extreme of abusing it, you've earned the ability to do that and your performance speaks for itself. Right? So it's really about whole self. If you bring your whole self to work, there are different times when your whole self is performing at a higher level than your whole self is on another day. Organizations that recognize this about individuals and really embrace it, I think get a stronger ROI in general from their investment in that colleague.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and then they have you from ... Now, how many years again have you been there?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It'll be 20 years in January of 2022. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You're feeling supported like that. I mean, it's obviously wonderful retention.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Right. I'm still here. Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
All that legacy knowledge and all that information that you hold about the business, they get to continue to enjoy that as well. Kind of just for comparison, when you think of when it hasn't worked as well as it has with Andy and Anré, what does it look like?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
That's an interesting question as well, and I thought about that as well, I have to say, because I think you do an inventory of all your experience and it's not to say that I didn't learn from the worst boss ever. It's just that when it came down to the core of it and I was doing this reflective exercise as I was thinking about coming in to have this conversation with you, I think I mentioned earlier I'm a values driven person. I really realized that the individual I was working for was different than I was in terms of our values. Because our values and what we put at the forefront of our values was different, doesn't mean it was wrong, it was just different than how I was perceiving my values, they were mismatched. It didn't feel good. It didn't feel aligned.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It always felt like it was a bit of an uphill battle and climb to really get on the same page. That just made it more difficult. We still had a successful relationship. It's just the individual didn't take the time to get to know me, understand my values and it's a two way street. So I probably had a role to play in that, but just the leadership philosophy and the approach was different and it just didn't align with my own approach. I'm a customer first driven person. I work for a customer oriented organization and when that individual's just got a different philosophy, it doesn't feel good and there's this conflict that happens.

Christine Laperriere:
What was the philosophy that you observed in that other leader?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
If I think about it right down to the core, it was an ambitious me first sort of attitude. That is not who I am. So I think about the whole. I don't think about the me in that situation. When the leadership was happening with a me first, it just felt like everything else was an afterthought. Because of that moment in that approach, it doesn't feel good. You don't feel inspired and motivated to jump out of bed every day. You collectively want to always do the right thing, but there are moments of reflection in there where I was really close to saying, "This isn't working. I think I need to move on." That's not a fun place to be in, but you know when it's not working and for me the value piece and the me first piece just didn't work for me from a leadership style point of view.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly the point too. So when you're working for someone with such conflicting values, they're not getting the best work out of you. So if you're in the back of your head debating over whether or not you still belong, we just have to be honest, your performance is not the same as it is under an Andy, where he's saying, "Doesn't matter what's happening, you're safe. I got your back." So that's the thing about performance is that you can have extremely high performing people who perform at different levels under different leaders.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
100%. Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
It's just a great example to kind of compare to these two great leaders that you worked with. So I would love to know just as we bring this to close, what is the ... I work with a lot of leaders who are early in their career and they're aspiring to be a best boss one day. What are the words of wisdom that you would share with them?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Ooh, that's a good question. Words of wisdom. Okay. I think the first thing is manage your career with intent. So I think that if you have aspirations to be a boss, you should manage your career with intent. I think that you should understand the power of connection, and really make sure that you leverage the connections. That sort of then springboards me into the power of networking. I think I mentioned, not my favorite thing to do, but such an important thing to do. Because if you think about it as being a boss, the more are networked you are either internally or externally, you can open doors, you can remove roadblocks for your team. Your team can learn from the relationships. You can introduce your teams to those relationships. I think it's just really important that you continue to think about what that means for yourself and for your broader team.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Then I think about the principle based approach. I think if you are in a situation where you need to be making decisions, or you need to be able to articulate strategies and the decision you've made against them, if you take a principle based approach and make it consistent across all the decisions you're making that relate to that strategy or to that subject, you're going to ensure that you're passing on a skill-set to your colleagues and to your teams that they continue to evolve in their own decision making.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Then the last thing is just be the CEO of you, because no one else is going to do that. You are the CEO of you. I've said it to both my children. You're the CEO of you. You really have to think about what that means as you evolve your careers and you start thinking about what you want from an education point of view or whatever that is, how you continue to grow and learn. I talk about this all the time with people that I mentor. It's really important to have clarity, set goals, think about it for yourself, but be the CEO of you.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. That's fantastic. Now, I am going to ask you one more question just because I wanted to probe. I heard you mention mentoring. Any tips for those of us who are out there attempting to help mentor and really support future talent?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Yeah. I mean the first tip I would have is just do as much of it as you can, because what I find is I get as much out of it as the mentee is getting from the relationship with me. It's a two-way street. There's no which way I would speak about it differently. It's a two-way street. I always learn from every single person I'm in a mentoring relationship with, and there's just such good growth. It's about carving out time to do it. It's not going to come naturally. You literally have to be very disciplined about it and you have to just set the time, in my case, in my calendar for it. I don't mentor just people within my organization. I'm also mentoring outside of my organization and I think that that's really important because the learnings you get or the talent you meet ...

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Well, it's not self-serving. The intent isn't to bring them into American Express. At some point they have career aspirations that I can open a door either through my network or through my own organization. I think it's so important to give back and I think you just have to make the time for it. How do I do it? I do it through organizations like Women of Influence or whatever organization I'm part of. You meet people and then suddenly there's a connection and you build off that connection and you get into a mentoring relationship. So sometimes it's formal and sometimes it's impromptu and you've met someone at an event and it turns into a lunch that turns into a more regular touch base of a mentoring type relationship. So I highly encourage people to give back because I think it's really important.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. Well, Kerri-Ann, this has been amazing. I know already that I have lots of listeners who are going to love hearing your story today and especially hearing about these two best bosses. They were great examples. So thank you so much.

Title: Understanding my passion
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Bryan Shone

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the boss that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperrier.com, and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. And with me today, I have Bryan Shone. I'm so excited that you're here.

Bryan Shone:
Oh, it's great to be here. Thanks very much for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
Just for everybody's frame a reference, give me a little introduction on yourself so everyone knows who you are.

Bryan Shone:
Sure. Well, as you said, my name is Bryan Shone. I'm the executive director at Hamilton Children's Aid, and I've worked in the not-for-profit sector for 26 years now, working to support children and families in the community. And love what I'm doing and continue to enjoy leading in this field.

Christine Laperriere:
This was the reason why I really wanted you to be on the show. And I'm so glad that you decided to be a guest, because most of the people I interview on the show are in corporations or big companies, and your expertise being a non-for-profit, and also being a leader in that space. I'm just kind of curious, again, some of the themes are going to be similar, and I'm kind of curious where some might be different. But I think it's neat for people to get at a well-balanced point of view by hearing your leadership experience in that space.

Bryan Shone:
There are some things definitely that are similar, but there's probably some things that are a little bit different than in the corporate sector as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell us a little bit about who your best boss ever is.

Bryan Shone:
My best boss ever, really, I think when I was reflecting, really let me be who I was. So I was able to come to work authentically. One of the things that can be the same or a little different in the not for profit world is the passion for the work. When we get to work with children and families on a regular basis, that's something that you can really delve into and dive into. And my best boss definitely brought up the best in me by understanding what made me passionate and what helped to move me forward in my work.

Christine Laperriere:
How did they do that? I'm just curious. Did they ask good questions? Was it certain coaching? How did they find those things that were important to you?

Bryan Shone:
Yeah. When I think back on it, I think first and foremost, getting to know me as a person. So yes, getting to know me as an employee and what my role was and helping me to understand how I might work in the sector. But also getting to know me, what were my passions? Why was I doing this work? And what was it that I really wanted to accomplish? Not only did they encourage me to think about that, but then they also challenged me to do it. And then pushed me a little bit further than what I might even be comfortable in thinking about.

Bryan Shone:
So, as I was reflecting, I kind of thought, oftentimes, people are talking about the best bosses ever from the context of they were supportive, they were helpful. Sometimes it was uncomfortable. And when I look back on that, I feel like that was the time when the learning really happened. And when they were challenging me, it was also from a supportive perspective. So they were challenging me. They knew me well enough to know that I wanted to move forward, but also knew how far I was able to go in that moment and then continued to help me grow over time.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you describe a situation where you remember being a bit uncomfortable? I mean, as much as you can share?

Bryan Shone:
Certainly. I think one of the times that I was uncomfortable was in just, in the work that we do, a lot of what we're dealing with are our own biases, things that we might take for granted. But families and children that we serve come from different backgrounds, different cultures, different realities. And as a result of that, you always need to be very aware of where you're positioned in relation to, for instance, a family.

Bryan Shone:
And so sometimes, that becomes uncomfortable when you're thinking about a situation in a certain way and your best boss ever is saying, "Are you sure that it's ex actually that way? Give me a couple of other ideas of what it might be." And what was interesting is when I was doing that, when I was doing frontline work with families directly before I moved into management, it very much prepared me to then help and support those who I was working with when I became a manager, and ultimately, an executive director. I find to this day that I'm not necessarily doing a lot of telling people what to do, but I'm asking a lot of questions.

Bryan Shone:
And I think that's one of the things that my best boss ever did that I take with me to this day.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. What did you learn about yourself as you went through that experience working with that leader?

Bryan Shone:
The first thing that I learned was that I could do a lot more than I gave myself credit for at times. And secondly, that best boss ever really gave me an opportunity to do things that they were doing. So it almost moved me into the role of what they were doing before I actually got into that role. So it did a couple of things. One is it challenged me to think beyond what my current job was. But secondly, what it did was it gave me confidence that when I decided to move into that type of role, that I could do that role and made me a little more familiar with what that might look like, as well as test that out and see if that was something that was also for me.

Christine Laperriere:
And then can I ask you, given that your leadership, obviously, there's probably metrics and results that you work toward. When you work for a best boss under those... Your job is so interesting though, because it's definitely, the end game is much different than what some of us are facing in the business will world. So help me understand, what's the impact of having a great leader in your space versus the impact of working for a not great leader? What's the difference in outcome?

Bryan Shone:
I think first and foremost, the outcomes and metrics might be slightly different, but it's still important to have outcomes and metrics. When we talk about families and children that we serve, we're really talking about longer term outcomes. People being successful in their family lives as well as in their personal lives with our youth. One of the things that it taught me was, number one, that you need metrics and that you need to be always looking at the outcomes that you're trying to achieve.

Bryan Shone:
One of the things that they taught me really was to look at setting your intentions. I've learned how to do that over time and try and set my intentions now for our organization in a way that gets people excited and gets people engaged. I think that when I think about my not so best boss or bosses, I think what I'd more think about is that they were very much focused on the task, tended to unfortunately get into the weeds and perhaps, micromanage a little bit. At the end of the day, it sort of stripped away confidence rather than added to confidence.

Bryan Shone:
They were able to challenge. But the challenge without the excitement of, "You can do this," really becomes a weighing factor, I think, on your development. And so trying not to do that. The other piece that's interesting is that people talk about accountability as if it's a negative word. And I've really learned, I think over time, that that's not necessarily a negative word. Accountability is really about what helps to move us forward. And so when I'm talking about a best boss ever, and I'm talking about accountability, it's a little different than my not so best boss, in the sense that a sense of accountability is more about what you're not doing, as opposed to challenging you to be better at what you are doing. So that's kind of what I reflect on when I think about that juxtaposition.

Christine Laperriere:
The differences. And if you had to teach or advise future leaders on how to be wonderful leaders in your space, what would you encourage them to really focus on?

Bryan Shone:
Well, I think first and foremost, I would say engagement. So making sure that people have an opportunity to be part of the organization and part of the change that you're wanting to see within your leadership. The second piece would really be about how you continue to grow people and making sure that you know them well, making sure that you're interested in their wellbeing and that you also challenge them to continue to grow and to develop over time.

Christine Laperriere:
So I just wanted to ask you some questions about the type of work that you do, particularly that you're leading in. Like I said, such a unique environment where the outcome is based on families. It's on the benefit for families. First of all, I mean, you must have some hard days. What is that like?

Bryan Shone:
Oh, a hard day can be some pretty impactful pieces of work. Sometimes there are family situations that are quite challenging, sometimes there's dangers. So our focus is really on the safety of children and the care of their families. Some of those days can be really difficult. We're in a sector that really focuses a lot on compliance. There's a lot of stress that's associated for many of our staff around that.

Bryan Shone:
But I would also say that the other side of that is the ability to really make a difference and a change. And so many people don't know this. And when we talk about children's aid, we're often talking about children being removed or being taken away. I mean, most people don't realize that as an agency at Hamilton, we're now at 98% of families that are together that we're working with on a regular basis.

Bryan Shone:
And so it's about when you were talking about metrics a few minutes ago, it's about understanding those metrics from an outcomes perspective. We've been able to see a reduction in the last couple of years of about 20% to 25% of our children in care. And we've been able to keep them in the community. Now, we can't do that without strong community partnerships and really working together with all community organizations across Hamilton in order to do that.

Bryan Shone:
So our bad days are difficult, but we have more good days than we have bad days. It really is looking for those, those outcome long term. Recently, what we did is instead of looking at the compliance pieces, we really looked at a vision for the organization, which engaged our staff, engaged the community, and we're engaging families in that endeavor to move forward and to maybe change some of the perceptions that the child welfare has had in the past as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So when they're focused on a vision for the future then, tell me how that's a little bit different than being focused on compliance.

Bryan Shone:
There's lots and lots of things in child welfare that we need to focus on. Government metrics, looking at a number of different things. There's requirements that need to send in all of the time. And all of them are really related to how we provide service. So, how often we might see a family, or the type of planning we do with a family. And all of that is important, but I would suggest that it's really not enough, because the question that we still need to ask is why are all of those things important?

Bryan Shone:
So for instance, when you go and you see a family, that's the compliance piece. But what you do with the family when you're with them, that's really the outcomes piece. What does that look like? How are you adding value? How are you supporting that family to be able to be successful? Oftentimes, we're working with families that are disadvantaged in our communities. So struggling with poverty, there's been lots and lots of information, I think, in the community over the last little while about the impact of race, Black families, indigenous families, which are all overrepresented in child welfare.

Bryan Shone:
And so we really need to think about the outcomes that we're trying to achieve even more so than the standards. We need to look at those, but we also need to be thinking about what this looks like in the future state, as opposed to current statement.

Christine Laperriere:
That's very brilliant. I can see why that's a shift in perspective, because I even see that in the business world, where we're focused on process for the sake of process, but we're not actually thinking long term, what is the benefit or value or impact we're actually trying to make by following all these steps? So I can hear the correlation there where you're getting people out of the weeds and getting them to think, how do we really have meaning in the way that we interact with families?

Bryan Shone:
I think that depending on what you're doing in business, you're focusing largely on quantitative measures or quantitative outcomes, how much of something you've made in a certain period of time, or how many clients you've served and those types of things. Really, we need to be looking at the longer term and it's really that qualitative piece as well as the quantitative. So what does it look like to get feedback from our community and our families? When are we adding value to the work that's being done? How is that being defined?

Bryan Shone:
Well, that gets defined through our community here in Hamilton. And it also gets defined from the children, and the families, and youth that we serve. Really, what we're trying to do is we're focusing in six areas, but really the first two are service areas. One is to support children and families within the community and home through adding supports, early help and support, utilizing the assets of a family themselves.

Bryan Shone:
So one of the things that we recognize is that families that are isolated tend to have multiple challenges. And often, for anybody that's a parent, I say, "Imagine that you didn't have anybody when your kids were six months old. And what would that look like?" And imagine that you have housing insecurity challenges at the same time. You weren't sure where you were going to live and you're trying to navigate a system at the same time.

Bryan Shone:
Well, that's the kind of thing that many of our families are struggling with. And so it's trying to knit together that social safety net. So I often say that child welfare is really a safety net under a social safety net. Families that we may not be captured in the day to day services that you and I might hear about in our community. Oftentimes, it's us helping to support pulling them back up into that social safety net.

Christine Laperriere:
And you're right. I mean, I can only imagine, I was pivoting an entire business from in-person to virtual with a two and a four year old and being locked inside when they closed all the parks. That was the particular, my heart goes out to people, because you're right. I wasn't worried about whether the roof was going to be over our head. And that was the one thing that I could sleep at night knowing, but just trying to figure out how to keep up with everything was nothing I've ever experienced.

Bryan Shone:
One of the things that ended up working really well and we just tried our best because you're working through it in the same way that you're talking about in terms of a business and kids. But for so many of our staff, it was the same reality. And you've got staff that still need to go out and see families right as well in crisis type of situations. And so we tried to be as flexible as possible. Our work hours became really, really flexible. Working from home. We haven't gone back to, I'm at the office, but we haven't gone back to everyone being in the office because it's worked so well. Now, the challenge is almost on the other side now, which is, "All the kids are in bed and I have 20 minutes. I can go on, I can answer some emails," and that kind of thing. So we're trying to encourage people to put down the computer, close the computer from time to time, and have some away time as well.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's amazing that you understood that, because I feel like some leaders were not empathetic to how challenging it really was for people to literally run a full-time school while running a full-time career in any field. And like you said, I saw the burnout hit really hard, especially that third wave that we went through here in Canada, just the amount of burnout. And I know I felt it personally, but the people I was coaching were really next level. I've not seen anything quite like that. And then it must be challenging for your staff, because again, so they're at home with that challenge, but then their work life is also family challenge. So it's like they're pivoting from one version of family challenges at home to another version of family challenges at work.

Bryan Shone:
And in some situations, those challenges being similar. So you got a single parent. You're empathizing with some of the same things that are happening. And you're also trying to support and give advice. I mean, it is a little like some of your work around coaching. You're coaching a family through it and you're like, "Yeah. This is really hard for me as well." That creates some real opportunities, but it creates definitely some challenges where you feel like you can't away from it. Sometimes you might go, "Oh, I can go to work and get away from that just for a couple minutes or an hour," but they're going back into their families and then doing the same.

Christine Laperriere:
That's so interesting to me. You're right. I definitely had experiences where someone would be doing the same thing I'm doing at home and looking for coaching. And I almost want to just sit down with a box of Kleenex as I go. It's really hard.

Bryan Shone:
You're right.

Christine Laperriere:
You're right. I got no answers. It's just really bad. Any other pieces you want to add to this that you think would be interesting for people who are listening right now?

Bryan Shone:
If I was to give one piece of advice is when we talk about this change, sort of that outcome space piece, it's messy and it's not easy. And it's easier in some ways to be able to check off each of the pieces that you're doing. So for leaders that are, are moving through transformational efforts in your organizations, it's trying to maintain that focus for a longer period of time, but also suggest that from time to time, you're going to hit challenges. It's hard to paint the picture of where you want to go and to support people to get there. But I would say that it's completely worth it in the end, but that doesn't mean there aren't questions, there aren't people that are trying to understand what you're trying to do. And just to keep on keeping on, keep focusing on clarifying, supporting people through that process. And you'll get through to the other side of where you want to be.

Christine Laperriere:
So how has COVID of change the way that you lead, especially given probably the demand on your community during COVID?

Bryan Shone:
Well, the demand to our community during COVID is interesting, because I like to talk about early help and early support. And we've been trying very hard as part of our vision to provide early help and support so families don't end up in crisis. That has been a challenge during COVID, because lots and lots of services had to go virtual. Sometimes during COVID, families came to us, not so early. And as a result of that, families were sometimes in crisis. I think that that created some unique challenges for us and unique challenges for families as well. We've been working very closely with a number of community supports and working together as a community to try and solve some of those challenges. And we've been doing that really since COVID started.

Bryan Shone:
Some of the strengths though with COVID is the virtual perspective and having access to virtual services has also been helpful. So we've been able to connect sometimes with extended family members, we've been able to connect with families in a different kind of way. One of the things that we did early on is we realized that a number of our families struggled with technology. And as a result of that, we put some things in place so that families had the technology to be able to have conversations like you and I are having today through a virtual means.

Bryan Shone:
Our staff, I think, first and foremost, have done an amazing job. So unlike some other companies, we were an essential service. And so we worked face-to-face with families throughout this whole process. So definitely some challenges is around. What does that look like and how do we stay safe? We keep our community safe at the same time. I just can't say enough about the leadership team and the staff that serve families in our organization. They've been able to pivot and move through that in a really amazing way.

Bryan Shone:
And the waves of COVID were also a challenge, because sometimes, we were able to be out there more easily than in other times. We've kind of had to ebb and flow with the different waves. And that's definitely been a challenge, but we've been able to provide service all the way through. And that's in huge part to all of the work that people are doing here every day.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Bryan. This is fantastic. Again, I'm just so thankful that you came and shared your story and your insights with me.

Bryan Shone:
Great. Well thank you for having me. I really enjoyed myself.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast


Episode: 2
Title: Upward servng versus downward serving
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Gary Mottershead

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. Welcome, Gary. I'm so excited to have you on the show. And just before we get started, why don't you do a quick intro?

Gary Mottershead:
Well, great. Thank you, Christine. You and I have really enjoyed the relationship that we've had and just a bit of background. I have been at work for a long time, a few decades now at this point, and I've started a couple of companies. So I'm president and founder of GCP Industrial Products. And the way that I know you is really through Strategic Coach. And I've been a coach for entrepreneurs for, I'm in my 25th year now. And a participant been in Strategic Coach for my 30th year. That's how we get to know each other. I have my own business, but also had the opportunity like you have to help other people grow and achieve their passions. That's Gary.

Christine Laperriere:
Perfect, and the reason that I thought you needed to be on The Best Boss Ever podcast was because I get the impression from our relationship that you've not only got an incredible history of working as a leader and working for a number of different leaders, but also the fact that today you actually coach and mentor a number of different leaders through the Strategic Coach program. Really the mission of this podcast is to extract those amazing stories about those leaders who are the best bosses ever. And I felt like there was a high probability that you would've either worked for some of them and, or coached and mentored some as well. So thank you so much. And I would just say, even just for starters, who is your best boss ever? Can you think of a leader that you worked for like that?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, you sent some notes out to begin with and I had a look at it and I'm going to say part of it was a challenge. And the sense of the challenge is that I've been on my own for more than 30 years. And so I think one of the reasons that I did that is I learned a lot about being bosses and some of them not so good and some of them good. And an interesting thing was a boss that I remember really well was when I joined DuPont and I'd come out of Imperial Oil, the Exxon Organization, and I went into industrial sales for the first time. I hadn't done that before, but I wanted to try it. And this was a grizzly older guy and it kind of hit one unibrow across here.

Gary Mottershead:
His name was Doug Hager. I walked into a brand new thing, I'm a young guy, and all wet behind the ears, so to speak. And I'm going into sales and he'd certainly been there all along, sales manager, and that's where he was going to be in his career. He wasn't going to go any further. And one of the things I really appreciated about Doug, he was tough on me. But in a kind way, if you can accept that sort of way is that he made sure, but he also allowed me to be myself. And just to put a little bit of a story together. I followed a guy who was totally well respected. His name was John Thode and at that point in DuPont I was in the plastics division and we were selling products made in the US.

Gary Mottershead:
Most of the division up there was working all in the Canadian made products. But there's a few of us at the US stuff. So we had to work with the US. And that's how I learned. I mean I've spent my whole life working in the United States. And this is where I first learned how to do that. But Doug was one of those guys who just allowed me to be me. And so when I was following this other gentleman, who'd done that job for 12 or 13 years, totally respected. I had to go across Canada. He was totally bilingual, and I wasn't. And I remember a couple of incidents that we were down in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and we're going in to have lunch. And I come into the restaurant after Doug and I was totally sheepish. And he goes, "What's up?"

Gary Mottershead:
I said, "Well, I locked the keys in the trunk." And I go, man, this has got to be what I later would call an SCI, serious career impediment. And at that point in time, so again, we had a rental car, whatever, how do you get to it? And you had locked, and they weren't all electronic things as you had now, because this is way back and that would've been what, I joined DuPont in anyway in early '90s, whatever case was. Anyway, but I remember taking out the back seat of the car, taking out the back part of the seat of the car. And I was small enough that I could get through the crossbars and reach in to get the keys in the car. And he just let me do all of this stuff. And I go, you know what?

Gary Mottershead:
That was the best thing he could have done. He let me be me. He let me make the mistakes. He supported me. And the thing that I learned, you talked about that he wasn't well respected in the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
Really?

Gary Mottershead:
He was not well respected because I think, because when you ask this question, what I found in corporations, in corporate is that you had to be really upward serving and not downward saving. So upward serving is that you looked after your boss, you didn't necessarily look after people.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.

Gary Mottershead:
And you spent more time in large organizations. I spent about 10 years and that was enough for me to do that. And I found that. So, but he looked after me and he was not the kind of guy, he was gruff and always wasn't the neatest one. So he didn't fit the whole corporate mold to do all that. And dealing with the US, I know you're an American, I was born an American. You have to have a particular way that you go about doing that. And you ruffle the feathers, they don't need to know that you've ruffled the feathers so to speak, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And he couldn't do that because he was his own guy and he eventually retired out there. But what was really great it was the first time that I had ventured into the sales side of things and out of the, what more protected corporate world that I was in at Imperial Oil. And no longer being just an engineer, but being in sales and I look back upon that time and that was a really formative time. I mean, that really set the direction for me because I was not meant to be in the corporate world for, and talk about bosses. I always felt that I knew better than my bosses and that doesn't go over very well.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, well, and sometimes what do we do? It is what it is. But no, this is interesting. I'm just kind of rehashing the story because it's very interesting to me. It wasn't so much, you don't remember him so much for him, his softness sounds like again, he had kind of that hard edge, but he allowed you to be you. And then also I thought of what you said here about he wasn't upward serving. He was actually, he didn't play the political game necessarily upwards, but it sounded like he was really there for you as you were trying to transition. And he gave you space to make that transition, which is really interesting. That makes him a very memorable boss in your career.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, absolutely. Because when you look at bosses is that it's got to mean something to you, not just for them. And I mean to me, that's what a best boss is all about. That they're looking out for your world and for their world. And I don't know what you'll find as you go through the other people that you interview. You'll certainly find some common characteristics and common traits, but I would suspect from the people that I've coached over, it's those who say, who really understand what the other person needs to have. And it's no different than life. And you're married, I'm married to our partners. We have to understand, it's a similar kind of situation. And so that's really the important part.

Gary Mottershead:
If we're thinking all about us, that's all about me. You can be as smart as you want. You can be as intelligent as anything, but people aren't going to relate to you.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
What are they going to relate to? They're going to relate to what you do for them. And I don't care what aspect of life that is. And so that's what I've learned. And that's what I really picked up through all of this. And I learned those that would accept cause even at DuPont, I had people who I knew very smart who did things, but I had to disagree with them. And disagreeing with a boss is not a good thing in a corporation, because it doesn't matter, okay? It doesn't, it's not their money. What do they have to say?

Gary Mottershead:
What do they have to do? And so if I can give you another little story, which you'd probably find cute on the opposite side. Doug was a sales manager and Doug worked for a gentleman who was the vice president of Plastics. And so in their wisdom, they gave the United Way campaigns, if you recall those to some of the young guys. And so the goal in the organization that we'd have 80% participation. You put up those thermometer charts, right? Down in the hallways and everything else. Everybody's in the hallways. We're down in the Toronto Dominion Center, 27th floor of the Toronto Dominion Center, so it's big group people. And so I had the thermometer chart and we keep getting up there. And the vice president would report to the president how his division in plastics was a pretty big division.

Gary Mottershead:
And so it got to the point that he told the president, he had 80% participation, everything else. And then he comes down the next week and the chart's up to 100%. He tells the president, he's got 100% participation. He feels really good. It was a big deal. So the next week comes in, we're at 110%. He comes storming down to my office. He was a big man. And said, Gary, "How can we be at 110%?" I said, "The goal was 80%. We've overachieved the 80% goal for the corporation." He was furious. Absolutely furious because the goal was 80%. That was 100% achievement to me.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay, hang on a second. Explain this to me. You guys blew the number out of the water.

Gary Mottershead:
What we did was, the goal of the corporation was to have 80% of the people participate.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
To me, achieving the goal was 100%.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
So when we got to 80%, the thermometer chart read 100%. He told the president that he had 100% of his whole division participating.

Christine Laperriere:
Got it.

Gary Mottershead:
And then the next week he comes back and it's 110% and he's absolutely furious.

Christine Laperriere:
And now he is mad because right, you're over the 80%, which was the original target, the 100% of the target.

Gary Mottershead:
I realized sometimes that my way of looking at things was not the way everybody else was going to look at things.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, go ahead.

Christine Laperriere:
No, and I'm curious, as a leader, when you were working for Doug, how do you think he handled that?

Gary Mottershead:
Well, Doug kind of loved it because I would always challenge the authority and only if I felt I was right. It wasn't just for challenging it. And I can think of several instances when I did that, but I also realized that I wasn't then made for that world because you being an individual. So the other part about being a good boss is understanding the people and who they are as individuals.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And relating to those individuals and what they need. And so being equal to everybody is not necessarily fair because people need different things at different times. And different trainings, different attention. And so when I go back and I think about that, I always thought of Doug very fondly in that he really helped me along.

Gary Mottershead:
Not because he was the smartest guy, because he wasn't necessarily. He was a survivor in an organization and he also then accepted what his role was going to be. But instead of taking it out, some people when they get to their level and that's it, as far as they're going to go, they take out their frustrations on other people. And oftentimes it's the people that work for them, but Doug didn't do that. And so he really mentored me along in that respect.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, which is two years into 10 years that I spent in corporations. I spent the next eight years at DuPont and then it was time to move on.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, then one of the questions I'd love to ask just for comparison, you don't have to name names, but worst boss ever. Or one that stands out in your mind as having made an impact on you from even poor leadership judgment. What was that like?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, there's a couple. The one that I mentioned, I'll give another story, but there's another one early on. And it's just, when you could tell that people weren't being honest. There was dishonesty about them and they may have been, and I saw this more those who were in more the, what I'll call more the sales side of things and particularly going back like 30 plus years now. And it was a different world than it is today. Being an engineer by training. But just to see what that part of the world could get away with. And then when they were made into managers and management, they kind of tried to do the same thing. Still looking out for themselves, being upward serving, but not really being honest. And we could see right through that and everybody pays lip service to it because they're in a position of responsibility, but there's not a lot of following.

Gary Mottershead:
There's not a lot of feeling and camaraderie around let's rally around and work together. It kind of puts everybody off on their own. And the same thing happened with that gentleman who was the vice president is that I had certain feelings about customers that we have. And I remember, and he was a big man. He was about twice my size. And I remember being in a meeting one day with him, with customers and I'd known a bit about these customers that he didn't, and he was telling me that these guys were right. And I knew they weren't. And I told him in front of him that they weren't right. And that was the beginning of the end at DuPont. Cause I said what, it meant nothing to me except that my own integrity.

Gary Mottershead:
And so I looked at it and said, when you talk about best bosses, I think there are things you learn from your bosses. And I think some of the ones that aren't that good also are actually really good bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
Teachers.

Gary Mottershead:
Because we have to learn in life what not to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
You know? And you can tell, cause this goes back a long time as I've been more than 30 years now. Those are the things have stuck with me in those 10 years that I was there. There were a few others of course that I did appreciate. But when I look back over it now, the ones that I appreciated all really cared. They cared about people. They genuinely were looking out for your livelihood as well as their livelihood. And when you're in a corporation, that's a hard balance to have.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And balance both of those as you would've seen. So you either look upward and so you can move upward and have upward mobility. Or if you look downward, it probably keeps you from getting upward. So it has a double edged sword to it.

Christine Laperriere:
Interesting. But if we were to give a nugget for someone out there right now who is trying to be a best boss ever, right? They are very committed to their people and being fantastic leaders. What I'm hearing is this focus on not just upward serving, but also downward serving and the ability to balance, really understanding what other people need. But this isn't just what they need to get work done. This is what they need at a personal level to feel like they're contributing and really enjoying the work that they're doing.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, it's a good question. Good thought to that. And what I've learned over the time is that you can do both of those things. You can, and a really good boss to me is one who figures out how to get the best out of everybody, and really allows them to grow. And as they grow, because that's what people want today. I know you're a little younger than I am. And I look back over the generations, I have children in their 30s now. And so what do they want, what do they need? Everybody appreciates someone who helps them grow. And then there's an attachment to all of that. Well, if the boss is smart, the boss realizes as the people below him grow, he gets to grow, and he gets to do it.

Gary Mottershead:
That's the really smart thing. And so I think today, and I think particularly we're in the kind of world that we're in right now that we're all operating off of Zoom and in virtual world. I think there's more opportunity to do that. Christine, I really think that.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Gary Mottershead:
Instead of having to play the politics. And I love it when I go to Strategic Coach and Dan says, the CEOs don't really like this because their box is the same size as everybody else's box on the TV. And they don't have any hierarchy of position or anything like that. All the trappings of the world have gone. Well, now it's up to you. If you're authentic and you care and you help them grow, they'll help you grow.

Gary Mottershead:
And there can be a lot to that, but I try and simplify things down and said now how you get it all done is more complicated. But those are the things that I break it down to. And I think that's where today, when you're talking about the nugget, that people have got in the kind of world that we're going to operate in, regardless of whether, how long the pandemic continues or not, we're still going to be in this, in this virtual world environment. Those that can relate across this environment. Those that can and get other people motivated and going are the ones that are going to be the true and the best bosses and the great leaders in my opinion.

Christine Laperriere:
Great, thank you. That is perfect. That is exactly what I know so many of us want to hear that right now because we need to get focused on new sets of leadership skills in a way for this new way of working. It's a completely different game now. Thank you so much for that. Do you have anything else you want to add just as we bring this to a close?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah. I'd say you need to evolve. You need to continue to evolve. And I think you can bring the sets of skill that we had at the beginning of 2020 into 2021 where we are now. I think you can bring those. And the key thing is now you have to figure out how to operate, what I'll call facing the camera, as opposed to behind the camera. And those of us like you, Christine, or I who have been presenting and presenting for quite a while. I've had to figure that out. Otherwise, you wouldn't survive. And that's how to be authentic with that. And the authenticity comes from making sure that as one person told me, when I first started to coaching, they said, Gary, I see two people at the front of the room.

Gary Mottershead:
I see you and I see the program. Those two have to come together. So the key is that there's no hiding when we have a Zoom, there's no hiding. You see everybody, you get to see everything. It's actually quite intimate because you see everybody's face a lot closer than you would if you're in a room, especially if you're in a room with multiple people. So as a result of that, you have to learn how to be authentic. Once you're authentic now, and people get that. Now you've got everybody following and you can lead. If you keep trying, and so I put it this way. There's a difference between performing and acting. And performing is getting better at being yourself and acting is trying to be somebody else.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
We need to learn how to perform in these situations. So what does the people that you're with need? What does the organization need to help you do that? And then perform to the best of your abilities? My next door neighbor up in Collingwood was saying, Gary, I know I told him what I was doing as coach for people says, I have real trouble speaking. [inaudible 00:20:50] I'm a CFO for a company out west. And so I was all on Zoom and I happened to know something about that. He was an awesome racer, ski racer. And so I said to him said, Greg, what did you do to prepare for a race? Did you do the same as if your training race? No, I said, then you have to prepare. So to be at your best, you have to prepare for any of your presentations, such as you would prepare for if you're doing your race and you're going to go race downhill, you have to put it in the same context.

Gary Mottershead:
He was still Greg, whether he was training or whether he was racing, but there was a different intensity. There was a different way. And he was excellent and he was excellent that he still does the adult racing and that sort of thing. But he couldn't see how the two related. So you have to look at your own life and say, where did I have to perform at my best? And what did I have to do that? And in a team, that's the same thing. As a boss, what do I have to do to be at my best for them and for them to be able to be at their best. And I think if you do that part of it. So it's not so self-serving, it'll actually serve you very well as the boss. You'll serve the organization, but also serve the people that you work with.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, excellent. Thank you so much. And again, we're just thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.

Gary Mottershead:
My pleasure. And I wish you all the best with this, as I know you'll do really well. But it's an exciting project. I think it's really worthwhile right now, too, because people are struggling to figure out what's next for them.

Title: Embracing our common humanity
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Barry Danilowitz

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. Today, I have Barry on the show. I'm so thankful that you're here today. Thank you so much.

Barry Danilowitz:
I'm delighted to be here, Christine. Thank you for inviting me.

Christine Laperriere:
Barry, can you tell everybody a little bit about yourself as we get started?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. So my name is Barry Danilowitz. I am currently the Vice President of Retail Product Distribution at Scotiabank. I've worked in the financial sector for probably half my career on the client side. The other half of my career, I actually worked in the software and hardware development industry.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I've sort of seen both sides of the table and had a great many wonderful bosses in the course of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
And I have to add here that I'm so excited you took time to do this podcast with me because I coach about 50 women a year at Scotiabank as part of this program that I lead, and I was telling one of the women one day about the Best Boss Ever Podcast. And she got so excited and she couldn't wait to tell me how you were her best boss ever, and so she just beamed. At one point I said, "I'll have to make sure we make time for coaching," because she was so excited to tell me about the impact that you had on her as a leader.

Christine Laperriere:
So we reached out to you, we asked you if you'd like to be on the show. And so, today this is exciting for me to get a chance to work with you.

Barry Danilowitz:
That's great to hear. Thank you for sharing. And she is a wonderful individual and I'm glad she shared that story. And I hope what I have to say today is helpful to others.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you tell me a little bit about your best boss ever, or your best bosses ever?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. Yeah, and this was a fun exercise to go back through my resume and look at my career and reflect back. And what struck me, the thing that came to mind, first of all, was a boss I had very early in my career when I was just starting out, working as a hands-on Technologist. And he had all the characteristics of a great boss, friendly, supportive, had a lot of trust, great feedback, et cetera.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I think I probably worked for him for maybe a year-and-a-half. And in one of our meetings, he said to me, "Barry, you don't have to do this job your entire career." And he proceeded to explain to me all the other things that I could do, and it was sort of two messages. One, it was, "FYI pal, there's a big world out there and you shouldn't think that somebody's going to tap you on the shoulder." And I think that's the important message that everybody needs to hear, that careers need to be built and they take work, and so that was great.

Barry Danilowitz:
The second thing was him explaining to me something that frankly, we assume people know, but how do you ever know unless anybody tells you that there's actually lots of opportunity for you and you should seek it out? And the third thing was, what he was sort of highlighting was that he wasn't just treating me as somebody that did stuff, but he actually paid attention to what I did and how I did it, and let me know of all the great opportunities that were available to me.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it was a very large organization, but I think the point is I remember going home. I can almost see it and thinking to myself, "Holy cow, I had no idea that there was a whole career available to me." And that was really, I think the start of my career, despite having worked for a few years, that I actually took on more and more leadership roles, and took building my career seriously.

Barry Danilowitz:
But if he'd never had that to me, I don't know that I ever would've. And I talk to a lot of less senior people in the organization and I try and get to the point of having that conversation. And it's remarkable to me, how many people go, "Wow. I didn't know that," and they probably would've stayed in the same job for most of their career without ever having benefited themselves from a more diverse career, but also having the organization benefit from all that they have to offer.

Christine Laperriere:
Now, on that note, I'm just thinking about so many people that I work with, and maybe they're not best bosses, would love it if they would just stay. If they're competent, they're doing a great job in that existing role, isn't it beneficial for them to just go, "Great. I have one last position I have to worry about?"

Barry Danilowitz:
Christine, you are raising a really great point, and I think what's behind a lot of people's resistance to having that conversation, to saying to somebody, "You're awesome, but you need to move on," is precisely the reason you've mentioned, is that you've got somebody great, they're a high performer. You don't have to worry about them. It's one less job that you have to fill, and it's one less interview cycle, new hiring cycle that you need to go through, which let's face it, is work.

Barry Danilowitz:
But I think as leaders, we have a responsibility to let awesome people know how awesome they are, and to encourage them to seek out more and better opportunities, and grow and develop their careers. Again, not just for them. I think we have a moral responsibility to do that for them, but also to the organizations that we support. We want to get the best out of the people in the organization, and keeping them in a corner somewhere, doing a great job, but never having the opportunity to flourish, really doesn't benefit the organization either.

Christine Laperriere:
I just have a thought, a kind of an aha moment while you're saying this. And I thought, is there something to the fact that sometimes the best bosses who know how to encourage somebody to fly, even if it's not immediately convenient for them, because they're going to have to fill that role and coach somebody new, but if they are a best boss, maybe they have confidence and they enjoy that development of new people into their team?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that's also a great point. I think best bosses are people who like people, and people who like taking the opportunity to bring out the best in people. And I think that if you are the kind of person who takes joy in coaching and mentoring, and helping people realize how much value they bring to the organization, doing it with the same person day in, day out, year in, year out, you're not really going to satisfy that desire, but an opportunity to meet somebody new and help somebody new, grow somebody new is a wonderful part of having the responsibility of leadership in an organization.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's an aha moment. I'm just thinking to myself, of how many times you hear a similar theme in that best boss ever, as different people have worked with different leaders. And it always surprises me that people would prefer to coach somebody new and keep moving people up through the organization even if it means a bit more work for them, but if they enjoy it, then it's not that much work, right?

Barry Danilowitz:
Yes, exactly. And you can never be perfect at it. I think that's the thing, is there's always an opportunity to be better and do better. And again, if you're doing it with the same person day in and day out, you're not really getting that opportunity.

Barry Danilowitz:
The other early boss I thought about was perhaps a little bit later in my career, and again, a great boss. I was very happy to work for him and supportive, and encouraging, and very happy to see me grow and flourish. But the one thing that he did for me, that nobody else had until that particular point in my career was we'd just finished a presentation to a fairly senior group and I said, "How do you think that went?" And he said, "Good, clear messaging, articulate. You kind of waffled in the middle there."

Barry Danilowitz:
And it was a really great example of two things. One, it was honest feedback and it was delivered in the moment. And I think everybody, or a lot of people talk about the value of feedback, but it's amazing, as I have taken it more and more seriously to give people feedback, how many people say to me, "Wow. Nobody's ever actually given me honest feedback." I've had lots of people say, "Good job." I've had lots of people say, "Well done," but I've never actually had somebody do me the courtesy and the respect of giving me open, honest, constructive, of course.

Barry Danilowitz:
There's better and worse ways to deliver it, but open, honest feedback, and I think you're demonstrating that you care about the person's career. You're demonstrating that you care about the person's development, but you're also respecting them as an individual because that kind of feedback is very, very personalized most of the time.

Barry Danilowitz:
And of course, it has to be delivered in the moment, but it just opened my eyes to the... It stung a little bit initially, but of course, afterwards, I thought about it and thought, "You know what? He's right. I was waffling. That's the truth of the matter." And now I'm trying very carefully not to be a waffler.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it reminded me of a great coach I had one time, who said... because again, I think a lot of people talk about giving feedback, but very few people actually do it. She said, "It's better to give somebody a bad day than a bad career." And every time I hesitate to give somebody feedback and I think, "Oh, is this going to sting too much? Is this fair?" I think those words resonate in my head and I think, "Better for me to let them hear it." Take it or leave it, but at least I'm being honest, and at least I'm giving them the opportunity to do better and grow better.

Christine Laperriere:
That is such a good quote, especially given that I was thinking while you were talking. I thought, "Oh man, you must have heard that though, and went home that night." How did you feel that night when you got that piece of feedback?

Barry Danilowitz:
Well, it was a little bit of a double edged sword. I thought it's done because I think that presenting is one of the things I like to do. As part of a job, I like mentoring people and I like presenting. And so it hurt, but I played back the presentation in my mind, and I looked at the PowerPoint, and I thought, "You know what? There's definitely an opportunity for me to be a little crisper in my messaging, and not get too interested in the chatter, and not be too enthusiastic about showing how clever I am because that's not why we're here. And I'm not that clever. The point of this exercise is for me to quickly and efficiently get information across, and you know what? I didn't."

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny that you say that, because I immediately started thinking of some candid feedback that I was given throughout my career, and how transformative it really was to have a leader give me not just the, "Oh great job," but actually say, "You know what? Here's your opportunity." Those last with you. Those messages, they do make you better.

Barry Danilowitz:
They do, and they're rare, and there's no perfect person and no perfect employee. And unless somebody provides you that feedback, how are you going to know?

Christine Laperriere:
And then any other leaders that come to mind as you're thinking through this?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. A more recent leader I have had did a really interesting thing. Now, of course, in COVID times it's a little bit different, but whenever we met for a one-on-one, he always made a bit of a show of turning off his cell phone and turning it over, and putting it aside. It was his way of saying, "I am present. I am listening to you right now."

Barry Danilowitz:
And it's so important for leaders to be present, to listen carefully to what people are saying and what they're not saying, and to demonstrate that you care and you're interested. And it was a simple gesture, and I know it was hard to do. He's a very busy guy. It was a small gesture, but a very powerful one to demonstrate that, again, that he was interested, and that he cared, and that he was present. And being present in a one-on-one with somebody who you are responsible for managing is such an important part of the leadership experience.

Barry Danilowitz:
Now, of course, in COVID times, there're other ways you can do it. You can sit with your hands crossed on the screen and then clearly, you're not typing or looking at your phone. There're ways around it, but I thought it was quite a powerful gesture.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that. I feel like there're leaders that I work with that you benefit from that thinking about how's the ritual that you're going to use, that's going to really demonstrate your fullest attention as being given to somebody.

Barry Danilowitz:
Yes, everybody, all humans have a basic needs to be heard and seen and respected, and everybody understands that their leaders are busy, but it's so important to give people the time to listen to what they're saying, to listen to what they're not saying, if you really want to bring out the best in them.

Barry Danilowitz:
And that means being present and turning off your phone, and not looking at it or whatever else is going on your screen is a great way to convey that message.

Christine Laperriere:
It really demonstrates your commitment to them in that moment. That's excellent. Do you have any other stories or things that you were thinking about that you feel like you want to add to this?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think the one other thing that, that leader that I mentioned recently does is I think as part of leaders, a little bit of your job is to listen to people complain. It's inevitable and I always say, "Look, I'm happy to listen to your complaint, that's part of my job. My job is to help you, and if you need to vent, I'm here for you." And he does that and he did that, but I think the other interesting thing I did is he always presents the other side of the story, and there are always two sides to every story.

Barry Danilowitz:
I think we know that in the back of our minds, but he makes a very conscious effort of saying, "Well, maybe think about what this person is actually trying to do." And I think it does two things. It balances the thought by providing a little more context, because I think we all get very heads down and involved in what we do in our work. And we forget about how the work that we do exists in a much larger context, but it also serves as a good reminder that the work that you're doing is actually important as in, okay, you may be frustrated with this person, but remember, you're doing this thing to help this person with this other thing. And they have this other responsibility to these other people.

Barry Danilowitz:
And especially in a large organization where sometimes you feel like a little cog in a very big wheel. It's important to remind people that the work that they do is important, the work that they do matters, the work that they do has an impact to the larger organization and lots of other people because I think, again, is we have a little bit of a tendency to be a little bit inwardly focused, and he's really great at setting the larger stage, setting the larger context.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and that would be a powerful engagement tool. That would be really powerful because again, once it brings you back to what your bigger purpose is and how you're impacting things at a broader level that you can't see or remember sometimes, it would kind of fire you back up again, right?

Barry Danilowitz:
Absolutely, and I think it's interesting in our employee engagement survey, one of the questions goes something like, "Do you understand the connection of your work to the larger value of the organization?" I'm getting the words wrong, but the sentiment is something like that. And I put a lot of work into having that conversation with my direct reports and their direct reports, and so on, because I think especially as Technologists, you sort of forget the value of the work that you do and how it impacts your business partners, and the customers, and the stockholders, and all of the other people in the organization. It's often not obvious to people, how the work that they do connects.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I pay very careful attention to that score because it's surprising how often... People will do a great job, but you ask them why the work that they do is important to the larger organization, they often don't actually understand. And when you take the time to explain it to them, it has a very enthusing and empowering effect on people because they really understand why the work that they do is important. And the work that everybody does is important, but it's really important to make sure that people understand that.

Christine Laperriere:
And they remember it when they are frustrated. So I have a question for you, when you think of having worked for probably varying ranges, from a best boss, all the way down to maybe not a best boss. When you think of the impact to the bottom line, the difference between working for a best boss versus not, what's the impact to the business?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think the impact comes in many forms. Sometimes it's obvious in terms of increased cost or lost productivity. And maybe I'm a little bit biased here. I find in technology, you often meet incredibly smart people, like incredibly smart people, but if they don't understand... Again, if they don't understand the value of the work that they do, their level of engagement, the amount of effort that they're going to put into solving a problem is not going to be at the level that you need it.

Barry Danilowitz:
And if you want to get those really big brains fired up around solving problems, making things more efficient, delivering products more quickly, finding ways to do things more cheaply, if they're not in engaged and enthused, you're just not going to see the productivity and you're not going to see the engagement.

Barry Danilowitz:
And the thing is, I can't remember the expression, something about one bad apple, one bad apple spoils the batch or something. If you have one person in your team who has a bad attitude, it can pervade and poison the entire team. And it may be a very good person who just maybe doesn't understand the importance of the work that they're doing, or don't understand why they're being asked to do work in a certain way. And then it brings down their productivity, but also the entire team's productivity, and there's a cascading effect.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I think if people... I always think of the four Es, are people engaged, empowered, enthused, and enabled? And unless people have all those four things going on, the hits to the productivity of their team and their organization, and anybody else who they deals with, can have a real impact on the bottom line.

Christine Laperriere:
So now, being that you've been named best boss ever by one of your employees, can I ask you, what do you do when you have a bad apple though? Sure, you can inspire and coach, but just help me understand, how do you deal with that problem?

Barry Danilowitz:
It's not easy and it takes a lot of time. I think first and foremost is recognizing our common in humanity, and I think people often forget about that. They get too wrapped up in their position and how high they are in the organization, or not high they are in the organization, and don't always take the time to really understand a person and get to know a person.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I always like to start with just a human connection. You know what? You've got to find common ground with the person, don't talk about work. The obvious one is, "How is your weekend?" But really dig into the, "How is your weekend?" Not, "It was good." "Really? What did you do? Oh, okay. You went hiking. Where did you go hiking? Tell me more about the hike?" And just start by trying to build trust, which you do by building a bond, some commonality, and trying to find a way to connect on a very, very human level.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I think once people trust you, you get a little bit of a sense of why it is that they are frustrated. And sometimes it's something personal that they are not obliged to share, but you may get a little bit of a sense that there's something going on at home that's making life difficult for them.

Barry Danilowitz:
And often, you can help. Maybe they're shy to say, "Look, I really need to take every Friday afternoon off to take care of my sick mother," or something that they're perhaps not comfortable sharing. Getting to have that conversation and finding a way to say, "You know what? It's okay. I'm going to give you the time off because you are valued and valuable, and I want to bring out the best in you."

Barry Danilowitz:
The other thing is you may actually find out that they don't like another team member. And again, that's not something people are readily going to admit to, but if you develop that trust relationship and say, "Look, I'm not going to tell, but you're clearly unhappy. What's going on? And I care. I care to know why it is that you're unhappy."

Barry Danilowitz:
Or the other interesting one is sometimes they just don't buy the project. They don't understand why they're doing what they're being asked to do, and all too often, we ask people to do things without taking the time to explain to them why it's important. And sometimes you can have a real transformative conversation with somebody to say, "Look, I know this might seem like an overly complicated project, or maybe you don't understand the product, but here's why this is important to our business partner."

Barry Danilowitz:
And there can be a real light going on, and let's face it, when you give somebody a project assignment, we don't always spend perhaps enough time as we should explaining the wheres and the whys, and the why fors, but sometimes it can really make a difference to people. So it's worth exploring, "Do you understand why you're being asked to do what you're you're doing?"

Barry Danilowitz:
And then the other one is sometimes, and this is always so sad, you come across people who are just in the wrong job. All right. They've been bumped around or they got assigned this, or somebody left and they were asked to do that. And so, they've continued doing it for the last three or four months, or years, and they're just in the wrong job. And it's the responsibility of the leader to find out what it is that they're more interested in, and get them doing something that is actually interesting to them, and that comes to the, are they engaged and enthused?

Barry Danilowitz:
If people aren't engaged and enthused, they're not going to do a good job, and nor would I expect them to.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that is excellent. And that point about a wrong job, I think of my own detour into marketing, which I'm not meant to be in marketing. I've found out, but I didn't work with anybody in that moment who was able to go, "You were extremely successful in these three roles, and then you ended up in a role that wasn't..." It wasn't about success so much as it was, "You weren't happy anymore. You didn't have the enthusiasm." It was one of the four years that you mentioned, but it changed, something shifted because that was not the same.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, I think that point about the wrong job, I see that unfortunately in bigger organizations where people get promoted and they move and they move. And then all of a sudden, they end up in a position where they're just like, "This isn't my happy place. I was so successful, and now I ended up here."

Christine Laperriere:
Sometimes they just leave the organization because they feel at this point that their leader is not... they're not looking for that next job for them though. They're not looking for what would be more exciting for them.

Barry Danilowitz:
Which is so unfortunate, because in many cases, they're really good people with a lot to offer. People say, "You should find your jam or find your bliss," and you should, but your leader has a responsibility to make sure that you are engaged and enthused, and sometimes asking a couple of probing questions to get to that point. And you can't always solve it right away, but at least, "Okay, let's acknowledge that this is not the best fit for you. There are many other wonderful things that you can do for the organization. I can't make a change right now, but let's work towards it together." And just that alone can have a difference for people.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, yeah. And a great leader can observe what that person is strong at. So when you are in the wrong job, you're not feeling very strong, but a great leader can say, "I do see your capability here, your capability there." And so they can even help provide the advocacy for what you're great at.

Barry Danilowitz:
Yeah, exactly. But it has to be a conversation and somebody has to care enough to have the conversation.

Christine Laperriere:
And I think that's the essence of some of the things I keep hearing, and the way that you're explaining those best bosses, is that they cared enough. They kept coming back to, "I care about you enough that I'm willing to have the hard conversation. I'm willing to talk about the tough feedback, or I'm willing to talk your way through a wrong job, but I care enough about you, that I'm going to help you get through that next step."

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that's exactly right.

Christine Laperriere:
So I have one question for you as well. When you think of a not great boss, what's the difference in approach that creates that, or at least in your experience?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think two things come to mind. One is it's important for leaders to remember that they set the tone. And when I think of a boss who wasn't great, super smart guy, I definitely learned a lot, probably how to be more Machiavellian than not, maybe not a great skill. But the thing that I recall is a very sour attitude that pervaded the entire team, and it's important to remember to set the tone from the top.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it doesn't matter where you are in the organization. If you have people reporting to you, you have a responsibility to set a positive, productive tone, and everybody in the team had that attitude. And I've noticed as I encounter teams where there's a little bit of a negative attitude, nine times out of 10, whoever leads that team has a negative attitude, because people hire in their own image, but people also take their cue about how to behave from their boss.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I think when I think about what was bad about that situation was a very negative attitude that included making disparaging comments about others. And I thought, "Well, if he's making disparaging comments about others, what kind of comments is he making about me or the rest of the team?"

Barry Danilowitz:
It creates an unease, and perhaps a little bit of distrust, and words are powerful and words matter. And as leaders, you have a responsibility to set the right tone.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that makes so much sense to me. And those, like you said, the remarks you make about other people, sometimes leaders think that, that's a way of bonding, but ironically, it's actually extremely the opposite. It usually just creates like a massive amount of distrust. When they walk out of the room, it's like, "Now what's being said about me?"

Christine Laperriere:
I obviously work with a lot of leaders who are on their way or aspiring to be best bosses ever. So I just have any tips, wisdom, what would you really encourage people to think about or focus on as they're aspiring to be fantastic?

Barry Danilowitz:
I have a sticky in front of me on the four E's I mentioned. Is everybody engaged? Do they understand the value of what they're doing? Do they understand the value of what they're doing to the larger organization? So are they engaged? Are they empowered? Do they know that I trust them? Do they know that they have the right to make decisions? Do they know that I have them on the team because I think they're awesome? Does everybody understand that? Are they enthused? Do they care about the work that they're doing? Are they in the right job? Are they working well with the rest of the team?

Barry Danilowitz:
Finally, enabled, which is a very simple one, but do they have a computer that works? The number of times people say, "Oh, my laptop keeps crashing." Get a new one, but people are shy or they don't want to ask, or they think it's a problem. And I think simple things like that makes a really big difference.

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that have the courage to provide the honest feedback. It's so hard, but you'll just be astonished at how much people appreciate somebody taking the time to give them honest feedback, and it needs to be delivered in the right way and sensitively. But even if it's going to sting, just remember that it's better to give somebody a bad day than a bad career.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it's remarkable how often people will say, "Gosh, nobody's ever given me that kind of feedback before." Remember your impact. Remember that words matter and words are powerful, but also remember the great quote from Maya Angelou, "People may not remember what you say, but they will certainly remember how you made them feel." And that I think goes to the point of setting a positive tone. Even in a difficult situation, you can set a positive tone, but remember that as a leader, your team is looking to you and will take their cue from you, how to treat others and how they perceive their value is going to be very much reflection of how you talk to them.

Barry Danilowitz:
So take the time to get to know people. There are so many wonderfully interesting, super, super smart people out there, that if you just take the time to get to know them a little bit better, first of all, you'll learn something, but also, it's a way to get the best out of people. I always say most of the people that work for me will forget more than I'll ever know, but at least I can find a way to get them to deliver the value that they have to the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
When you think of getting to know people, I can just feel how that's a strength of yours, do you have any kind of tactical tips too? Just when you think of some people are more introverted and it's not as intuitive, or maybe they're working with a team that's a little more closed off, maybe from a previous leader. Help me think of how do you get there?

Barry Danilowitz:
It's a hard one because you're right. A lot of people are shy and a lot of people aren't used to leaders engaging on that level. I think I'll go back to what I said earlier, remember your common humanity. We may be at different levels in the organization and we do what we do at different kinds of organizations, but the end of the day, we're all human beings and we all have the same needs and desires, wishes, hopes, dreams, and fears, and just starting, going in with that recognition and asking questions, again, "Wow was your weekend?" "Good." "Why? What did you do this weekend?"

Barry Danilowitz:
Or, "Do you have any vacation plans? Or have you read any good books lately?" "No, I haven't written. I don't read." "Okay. What do you do?" "I like to watch TV." "What's your favorite TV...?" There are a 1,000,000 questions that you can ask, and the question isn't the important thing, right? It's what you learn about people's interests. What they like, what they don't like. There's always another question you can ask.

Barry Danilowitz:
I'm not a huge sports fan, and so I'm always challenged when people say, "Oh, I went to a ball game." "Okay. Who played? Where did they play? How are they doing in the league?" The fact that you're asking the questions, you'll get through the basic questions, but very quickly, you'll get to a very human conversation where you're going to find something in common, and you start there, and it only gets better from there.

Barry Danilowitz:
And some people, right away, they'll click and they'll realize that you really are just interested in getting to know them. And some people, you have to do it a few times, but it is so worth it, and it always pays off in the end.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is a great reminder for everybody out there listening, and in the world of COVID and now us working on Zoom, I know we have to be even more intentional sometimes about what you're talking about, where you have to make the time because we get onto our Zoom calls and it's like, we know the agenda of the meeting, tick, tock, let's go.

Christine Laperriere:
People are having to learn how to slow down and take five minutes of even what feels like an important meeting, to rapport build in order to build that connection.

Barry Danilowitz:
Absolutely. Absolutely. Again, we can't forget our common humanity and it's a starting place for all great relationships and communication.

Christine Laperriere:
Barry, I really enjoyed this interview. It has been fantastic. Thank you so much for all the tips.

Barry Danilowitz:
Oh, thank you. It's been great. It's great talking to you. Your passion around this topic is very inspiring.

Episode: 21
Title: Breaking the rules
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Rob Hartnett

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelapperiere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. Today. I have Rob Hartnett with me and I am thrilled that he took the opportunity to come on my show. And just before I get started, I'm going to tell you a little bit about how I know Rob. So Rob and I both were independent sales consultants when we worked for Miller Heiman. We were doing sales transformation work all over the world, actually. And one of the things that was so neat is we went to one of our annual sales conferences and Rob was the top performer that year. And he was celebrated as having the best performance and the best accomplishments.

Christine Laperriere:
And one of the things that I loved seeing is just kind of the natural, people-centric, high energy, motivating excitement you brought that year to the event. Instead of it being all about you, you really made it all about everyone and you really celebrated everybody in the organization that year. So I was part of your fan club then, I'm still your fan club now. And since you've gone on to do some amazing things, some independent things, you've written a book, It's All Possible, you've led the It's All Possible podcast, which I'm going to be a guest on soon. Rob, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Rob Hartnett:
Absolute delight, Christine. Absolute delight.

Christine Laperriere:
And anything you want to just share with us about how people can find if they love what you have to say today.

Rob Hartnett:
For sure. So you just mentioned the podcast which I do, the It's All Possible podcast on Apple and Spotify and on the C-Suite Network. You can also find me at my business, which is Proteus Leadership. So I'm one of the team at proteusleadership.com based in Melbourne, Australia. So that's the best way to find me. I'm on all socials. I'm not hard to find so just @robhartnett is the easiest way to do it.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm going to dive in with the question of the day, who is your best boss ever, and why? Tell us all about him.

Rob Hartnett:
I really struggled with the question. I'm simple. I'm from Australia. No, I'm kidding. I really struggle with it because I've had so many great leaders. I really have. And I have had so many great leaders and I really struggled with so many. But I did pick one. But is it okay if I mention a few and then I'll get to the one?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Rob Hartnett:
I find there's so many great leaders because I look for the best in everybody and I find you can learn from everybody. And I've learned so much from so many through my career at different stages at the right times. Clearly one that you and I worked with, he wasn't our direct boss, but to me, he was a boss. And that was Sam Reese, the CEO of Miller Heiman, and the other CEO at Vistage. And Sam and I still keep in touch. He's still unbelievable. He was on my podcast last year. So Sam to me was a great leader. I also work for a guy called Steve Vamos, who was the head of country for Apple when I was at Apple in Australia. And Steve is now the CEO of Xero with the great accounting software business. At HP, I had so many. Lew Platt who was the global president and chairman and everything. And I did have some interactions with Lew and I really enjoyed Lew's abilities to communicate to 145,000 employees. It was something that I rarely see even today.

Rob Hartnett:
And two other Australian-based leaders, John Bieske and Bruce Thompson who were the Australian-based leaders at HP. Andrew Carter and Paul Royce in my computing days when I was an IT reseller. They ran a very hard, tough, competitive business, but I learned so much from them. Tim Nicole Jones, who led me at the ad agency Mojo. You didn't have this in here, but I thought I'd put it in. I won a world yachting championship in 1994 and sailing with the great American Ken Reid. And Ken's a six time world champion, president of north sales. He's just an amazing lead. He's a personal friend. Ken, certainly he taught me a lot and I still use his leadership techniques when I'm talking to people today. That's kind of a list. I hope that was okay.

Christine Laperriere:
I have to tell you something really side note. So ever since I started doing the show, I love talking to people about their best boss ever. And what I will say is that it's always unfortunate how many people can only recall stories from their worst boss, but it's very hard for them to scale back and think about where their best bosses might have been. And so I'm listening to that company list, first of all. So those are some great organizations and it actually brings me a lot of hope just to hear that you actually have such a long list of great leaders.

Rob Hartnett:
And some of those leaders like for example, Sam, now CEO of Vistage, Steve Vamos, who is head of country at Apple is now CEO globally of Xero. He was a board member of Telstra and many others and head of Microsoft out here. And so what I find is that the good leaders, if you follow them, you'll see they've got a trajectory. It's not that they don't make mistakes. Sam was incredibly candid with me on my podcast, he said some things I didn't think Sam would say. It was really exciting because he's authentic. So I think you got to look for it though, Christine. I think it's really easy to find the faults in people. We all make mistakes. None of us are perfect. I know you are, but I'm not. You are perfect. We all make mistakes, so I think I like to just look for the best. But I did pick one. Do you want me to talk about the one I picked?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Tell us a little bit more about them.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. So the guy I picked for this one, and I said there was so many. But a guy by the name of Kim Hamilton. Kim Hamilton was my boss at HP. He brought me into HP and was my boss there when I was running emerging products. So I came from Apple into HP. The reason I put on Kim is that he was a kind of a low key leader. And what I mean by that was he really empowered people and he built non-dependent empowered teams, which I think is the real game for leaders today. If you're a leader and you are complaining, everyone's coming to you and winking to you and you've got problems you're solving and you're really working all these hours, that's on you because you've built a team of people who are dependent on you. And Kim did, was coming from Toshiba into HP, which was very interesting because HP had a lot of people they had just basically promoted internally because it was such a great company.

Rob Hartnett:
And Kim came in from Toshiba and he realized that they needed someone different to run emerging products. This is the newer products that were coming to market. You'll laugh when I say this, but one of my emerging products I ran was color printing. We're going back mid-90s.

Christine Laperriere:
You're dating yourself now. Yes.

Rob Hartnett:
I'm dating myself. But there was also a whole bunch of other products I had. And they wanted someone different. And so he fought for me. And I came from Apple. In Apple, we were evangelists for innovators. We're always the underdog. So he needed that kind of spirit. And so Kim fought for me and I remember the interviews I had at HP. And the first interview I went there and I just wanted to be there. I just wanted to join HP so bad. And they kind were a bit edgy with me. And [inaudible 00:06:30] was my greatest reference who I thought it would be my golden reference. Basically told them, "He won't last there because you guys are too slow for him." I'm like, "Thank you. That not exactly what I want you to say." But to his point. And so I remember Kim really fighting for me. And Kim saying, "Look, can you come back? I've got one more interview with John Bieske." who was the head of Australia at the time.

Rob Hartnett:
And I came back in and I sat there with John and John and Kim were there and John was running it. And John just said, "I'm just not sure Rob, I'm just not sure you'd be able to fit into the culture here. I don't think you'd fit the culture. I think you're really nice. I think you have a great record but I just don't think HP's the place for you." And I was so devastated. And then Kim kind of jumped in and he let me tell my story. And at the end of it before I was going, I said to John, "John, I really appreciate your view and the whole thing, but I'm coming here one day." And John turned around to Kim and he said, "Fetch your attitude Hartnett, you can come now." That was so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great.

Rob Hartnett:
It was Kim fighting for me. And then when I had to do a lot of things, I had to break a lot of rules at HP or establish things like we've always done it this way here, Kim would back me. And I think it's so important as a leader, he would back me. He would go, "Yep. That's fine now, I'm backing Rob." And Christine, you'll love this little story. When I went to HP, HP used has to have fleets of cars, all GM cars. So the car park at HP and Melbourne was full of GM cars, all these General Motors cars because we all bought them on the lease for the salary plan. I was driving a Porsche 911. That was my car.

Christine Laperriere:
Breaking the rules.

Rob Hartnett:
Because at Apple, that was almost the standard car, like four or five of us had Porsches. So I've come with my 911 and it was this hot car. It was so loud, it used to set off car alarms and the GM cars. And then someone went and complained. A leader behind my back came and complained to Kim and said, "Hey, who's this guy you've hired? How much money are you paying him? He's driving a fricking Porsche 911." And you know what Kim said? Kim said to this guy, this leader, a peer of Kim's. He said, "Yeah. It's good. We're all getting them."

Christine Laperriere:
Nice.

Rob Hartnett:
He joined my team. So at every point, even with a sense of humor, he had your back. And he empowered me. He empowered my team. He allowed me to bring on people who allowed me to cut through red tape and really transform, and with John's support. But Kim was just an amazing leader, backed me in so many ways. And when I went on to my next role to head up the personal computer business in HP, Kim was my biggest supporter.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's such a good example, that point about being able to cut through red tape and break rules. I'm working with a client today who was just talking about being an entrepreneur and we were kind of comparing notes. And he said, "I worked for Chrysler and I didn't feel supported in being an entrepreneur. I actually am much more supported as an external resource to businesses who ask me for all of that difficult, out of the box thinking because when I'm in the doors of the company, they don't appreciate it." They're like, "We wish you'd go away now."

Rob Hartnett:
And you're you're right. And it depends on the company. And certainly when I came from Apple, innovation was such a part of what we did and creative thinking and out of the box thinking was such a great place to be. So coming to HP, that was not what they normally did, but we did it. And I remember once I did a competition. So I had to get these particular devices really selling fast. And so what I did was I put together this competition. And the competition was based around sales of course, based around sales and volume and sell through. But I was going to reward the top sellers. Now typically, the sellers I was talking about for this product were in retail so they were between the ages about sort of 19 and 23.

Rob Hartnett:
I said, "I'm going to fly you to Melbourne." which many of them hadn't even been to. "I'm going to put you up at a five-star hotel. I'm going to take you to dinner. And we're going to go down the river by boat to see AC/DC in concert and you've got great tickets." Now, when I launched this, it didn't take off. I thought this was the most amazing package. It didn't take off. It was like a three-month campaign. The first month it was dead. I rang around a few of the dealers who work with HP and I said, "Are you getting behind this?" And they go, "Is it real? This is so un-HP. We have never done it. It's bullshit."

Christine Laperriere:
There you go. There's two out of the-

Rob Hartnett:
"Welcome to the party, my friend." And once I got that one over the line, oh my God, it was game on. But they just didn't do that kind of stuff. And even though John and Kim had backed me, the reaction from the channel was like, "Oh no, I'd say it's boring. We might go and see Mozart, we might go to the opera. AC/DC, for like 18 and 20 year olds?" They would've had such a great time.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic. I love that story. That is a great story. Any others from some of the bosses that you've worked for? So you had such an incredible list. I love the examples that you're telling though. These are great.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. I'll talk about Lew Platt. He's passed away now, but Lew was an amazing leader. As I said to you, one of the things that's amazing about Lew was he had staff of 145,000. And remember this is the days before Teams and Slack and all these kind of tools. But I knew. I was in Blackburn in Melbourne, Australia, and I knew exactly what Lew was thinking. Why? Because every month Lew would make a call. He would do a call where he would address everybody. And everyone just put the phones down, put the email down, and we listened to Lew for 45 minutes of where he was taking the business. And at one point, I just got so connected with where he was going and I'd read Forbes magazine and I'd read all these different magazines, also about HP and about Lew and all the big companies.

Rob Hartnett:
And I was a huge provider with Intel because I sold a lot of Intel PCs and I was head of PCs at the time. And I remember being at a Gartner conference and there was a whole lot of rumors around. What had happened, Lew had been at a Gartner conference, I think in Italy, and was on his flight back to the US. And he'd said something. And he was a very off the cuff, authentic leader. And they'd misinterpret it and made this kind of really big headline. And I saw it and I went, "Oh my God, there's a Gartner conference happening in Australia. They might say something about HP." So I said to my colleagues, "I'm going to email Lew and let him know that this has been misinterpreted so when he lands in the US, he'll understand it." And I just got laughed at, honestly, Christine.

Rob Hartnett:
People said, "You want to email Lew Platt? Good on you." You know what Australians can be like, pretty sarcastic. "Yeah. Get on, mate. You may have a go at that one. Yeah. Call Lew." So I literally emailed Lew and said, Lew, I read this. I met a guy at a conference in Brisbane. He wanted me to say anything else because I'm going to be on stage. I was actually on a panel. If it comes up, I just want to let you know this how the press has interpreted it." That was it. I left it. I didn't know. Next morning, 8:00 AM. "Hi, Rob. Lew here. Thanks so much for letting me know. I made it kind of a boo-boo in Italy. I didn't mean to say what I said. They misinterpreted it by the time I was on the flight. Thank you for picking it up and working the time zones for me. Here's the paragraph to use if it comes into question. Thank you so much. Lew Platt.

Rob Hartnett:
I literally printed that out and just walked around there the office for like an hour with a badge. But you know what? The thing about that, Christine, was me reaching out to Lew on that and him coming back authentically. And it was him, not his EA. But it made such a difference because about 12 months later, I realized, not only me, but my team and I realized that we needed to build a factory in Australia to build HP PCs. And guess who's approval we needed?

Christine Laperriere:
Lew's.

Rob Hartnett:
We needed Lew's. And Lew came out and opened it for us. And when he came to Australia and he met me, he knew. And it was 12 months ago. He knew we'd had that connection. And it made such a difference, I think, to getting it approved for the first time. And secondly, him coming out with his wife to open up the new factory in Australia. And so I think if you reach out to leaders... I was generally doing it from a place of care and empathy because I've had myself misquoted in press. You probably have had something similar too. But I could see the position that it could cause. And of course, HP is a public company. It's a big deal for a lot of people. And it was simply a misinterpretation. So I love what he did in that area.

Rob Hartnett:
John Bieske, who was a leader in Australia for a long, long time of all the personal computer business and so much business. He was there for many, many years. What I love about John, as I said to you, when I left HP, John and I left about the same time, although he'd been there some 25 years or something. When I was leaving HP, John saw me and he said, "Rob, the day you came and you first joined us, I said to myself, and I said to Kim, your boss, 'Don't worry. He'll come along but we'll change him. We'll get him to fit.' You know what? You changed us."

Christine Laperriere:
I love hearing that. That's powerful.

Rob Hartnett:
And when you have a leader, he doesn't have to say that. And John would write Christmas cards to everyone of his staff every year personally and hand them out. It must have been like 350, but he would do them. That was what John did. He knew everybody. He knew everybody's name. So people like that, Bruce Thompson, who was his leader, was very similar in many ways as well. They empowered people. They backed people. They trusted people. So they were to me, very authentic leaders, very approachable leaders. But also importantly, they were leaders who did two things that I teach people every week to do.

Rob Hartnett:
I teach new emerging leaders every week to do. They catch the good stuff and they call out the bad stuff and they do it early. They catch the good stuff early. They encourage you. They thank you. They recognize improvement. They do it. They don't walk past it. They don't forget about it. And the other thing they do is they'll call out bad behavior if they see it. And that doesn't mean the person's bad. It just means it's not aligned to what we're doing. It's not what we do around here. It's affecting the rest of your team. Whether that's me or anybody else, they would call it out and say, "No, you can't say that." or "You can't do that." or whatever it happens to be. You'll find the best leaders in the world will do that. They'll catch the good stuff. They'll call out the bad stuff and they know when they're doing it.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And so I find it interesting that both of us made the leap from sales transformation to leadership transformation. And so even though this question's not necessary early on script, I'm curious for you why that transition for you? I know why I transitioned.

Rob Hartnett:
Well, for me, I'd say it was simple, but it's not. It took a lot of time to work it out. And it was really through my work at Miller Heiman Group and when I was involved in the large transformations and mid-size transformations and small transformations. So whether they were small, large, global, so we worked on some big ones, you and I worked on some very large transformations. And people would come to me for the next one and go, "Rob, what's the secret source to making sure it works, it sticks, it's adaptable, it keeps on going. What is the secret source?" And I really got it down to three things, Christine and I still believe in those three things. The three things are leadership, accountability and discipline. And if any one of those three is missing, it will fall over or it will be short-lived.

Rob Hartnett:
Once I looked at that and I came back to going, you know what, but it's the leader who really drives the accountability and the discipline and is the leadership and management coming together. Leadership gets you going and management keeps you going. So when I looked at that, it starts with leadership. So to me, when I looked at what I was doing in the sales space, I thought there's more I can do here. And I have a passion for leadership. I love leadership. I love seeing it. I love seeing leaders lead. I see leaders grow, and I love it. And you're probably the same, but I've had a number of people who work for me still write to me and go, "Thank you for impacting me. Thank you for where I am now."

Rob Hartnett:
And they're in great positions and I love it. I love seeing LinkedIn profile and they're going to some huge role and you had something to do with that hopefully somewhere along the line. That's why I wanted to get into leadership because I could impact. And I think I was starting with John Maxwell and John Maxwell said this. He said, "The more leaders you can impact is the more people you'll impact." And that's where it was the catalyst for me. How do I get scale in this? The more leaders I can impact, the more people I can impact that we have more transformational leaders who lead with kindness and with empathy and understanding, and that's okay. And you realize you don't have to be this authority of my way or the highway, highly directed, don't know how to spell diversity type person, then we don't need that.

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny that you say that. We're so aligned in that. I used to see huge transformation projects. And just like you said, it was really reliant on the leader, but it was also reliant on how much people wanted to follow that leader because lots of leaders can come in and say, "Okay, everybody, scoot over. We have the big change." or "We have the next big assignment." But if people weren't engaged and bought in, it was just a long, miserable, frustrating process. So as an outsider, I had very little to do, ironically, with which ones were successful. It was usually if I could align with a fantastic leader who had, just like you said, some of these qualities, I just find those changes would go so well and I just got to be there and cheer it on.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. And it's so much easier for you and so much easier for the team to have those transformational leaders who are willing to do that. And luckily, I've been able to work with a number of those really good leaders and they would be fantastic catalysts to me too, because when we came to doing big change, I'd say, "Would you be happy to talk to this particular client who's looking to do this similar thing?" I can't tell you how many. I remember one, a major bank. And I spoke to this guy who's very successful in financial services. And they said, "Sounds like a lot of hard work. He was actually telling us about all the hard stuff we've got to do."

Rob Hartnett:
And I'm like, "Well, it's kind of why I got him to talk to you." "Yeah. But he was really saying there's a lot of stuff to do and can take a while and we're not so sure that we really want to do this." And I said, "Well, good, because you're not going to waste my time or anybody else's. So you need to understand going from A to B is not as simple, is not a straight line. And I could set you up for success, but you've got to want to put in the effort."

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You don't want to be living through those types of transformations and having your name attached to them. They're brutal.

Rob Hartnett:
Yes. You know it's just going to go south really fast.

Christine Laperriere:
So one of the questions that I love to ask, and I think I'm really curious about your answer on this. What do you think the impact is to the bottom line of working for a best boss ever?

Rob Hartnett:
In my experience, it's been massive. And again, I think not only bottom line, I think there's bottom line, but also for me, what I've seen working for a best boss ever has been an increase in things like customer set, increase in employee retention, increase in innovation, employee satisfaction themselves, culture. If you do a culture pulse, it's always good and getting better. But absolutely. If I look at one, just to give an example of this and I can't work the numbers out, but one of the other best boss ever I worked for was a guy called Anthony McMan. And Anthony and I were the ones who pulled the PC business together. But Anthony was my boss, but Anthony was so, so sharp. He spent many, many years as a very senior leader at SAP after HP.

Rob Hartnett:
But Anthony pulled together a team and knew the strengths of all of us. He knew my strength was in the inspirational or empowerment, getting everyone on board, getting the team together, getting our channel members to follow us, to build these programs. Anthony was about tasks and projects and pulling the team together. He knew where his strengths were. He was great as strategic leader. He was great at stakeholder management. And he just pulled a fantastic team together. And that allowed us to do what we do now. Here's what we did. We took HP PCs. This is to give an idea on metrics, from number 17 in the country in Australia to number one in under 18 months. Now you work the metrics on volume of shipping of product. Now you talk about bottom line. We dramatically changed the bottom line. We got recognized right around the world for what we did.

Rob Hartnett:
I won a HP high achiever award for it, which was kind of embarrassing, because it was so many people involved. But you know what we also did? We grew our channel members, so the channel members who sold our product, who hung with us for so long when we were 15 and 16 and we took them to number one. The volume they did, the families that we made wealthy, the kids we put through private schools, that's bottom line for me. That's what we did. We did a good bottom line at HP. We affected so many more people.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. Great story. That is amazing. If you had to sum it up, what advice would you say to any of the leaders that are listening to the show that are trying to become a best boss ever? What would be your pieces of wisdom for them?

Rob Hartnett:
It's funny I got asked this question by a leader this week so it was great prep although I didn't know you were going to ask it. I think the number one thing in this day and age, because we are coming through a pandemic, we're coming out the other end. I'm in Melbourne. If you don't know, we've been the most locked down city in the world past bonus areas about three weeks ago. We're world champions, Christine. We're very happy about... No, we're not.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. Winning the COVID award.

Rob Hartnett:
Winning the COVID award. I'm putting this in context. So the number one thing in any case, but I think more so now, is create a culture of psychological safety. If you haven't got psychological safety, you will not have any innovation. Andy Stanley says a great quote. And he says, "Leaders who aren't prepared to listen will be surrounded by people with nothing to say." If you have psychological safety, you'll have innovation. You'll have diversity. You'll have great ideas. You'll have people coming to you. You'll have people who are empowered and non-dependent right. So I think that's for me, because psychological safety is so important. And that means reaching out to your people. That means your people need your visibility, not your great vision right now. So connect with your people, making sure they feel comfortable. Are the ideas coming? If they're not coming and everyone's going quiet, what's going on.

Rob Hartnett:
So that's the first one. So psychological safety for me. Have that kind of culture of innovation and ideas. It doesn't matter how big your group is or how small your group is. A really great leader told me a good story he did when he was driving up startups, he was a serial entrepreneur. And one of the things they used to do was weekly failure meetings. So every Friday, you had to bring along something that you failed at that week, but you learnt from. And no one could come without it. You couldn't come along and laugh at me, Christine. You can't say, "Rob, you're an idiot." but you didn't do anything. So everyone came to the meeting and you had to come with what did you do this week?

Rob Hartnett:
And it could be, "I sent a direct mail out. It just didn't work. I tried something on social media and it didn't work. We did a TikTok video and it did work." You had to come along with something you tried that was different, but didn't work. And it's the fastest way to test. Do we have a culture of innovation? Do we feel psychologically safe? Now another colleague of mine... Funny enough, another guy on a podcast earlier told me a great story. When he tried this whole idea, he came in to talk about not value meetings, just where were we up to of all our projects. Tell us everything. He went around the room and I said, "How did that go?" And he said, "Dismal. No one volunteered anything." And then he said, "So I closed the meeting down in 15 minutes. And I went around and in my discovery and said, "Why wouldn't you prepare to share?"

Rob Hartnett:
And they said, "Well, we only share our outcomes at the end and we're halfway through and it's not going so well. And we don't want to tell anybody that." And he realized straight away these people are not psychologically safe. This environment, I have to change that up. So as a leader, he brought that on himself and he said, "No, I want to go under the hood. I want to know what the problems are." And again, first thing modeled the way. It's the number one thing from [inaudible 00:24:58] and the leadership challenges model the way. First thing he did was go, "Hey, this is where I failed. Guys, this is the project I'm working on, it's not going well. I thought I'd be going a lot better. I'm missing target." So one, model away. Secondly, psychological safety. And really work on this whole thing of non-dependent, empowered, effective people. Great leaders create more leaders.

Rob Hartnett:
If you actually think about that, if you think about all the best boss ever you probably heard on your program or spoken to, they will have created more leaders. How do you more leaders? And the way you do that is who's replacing you? So you're a leader, who's replacing you? Is it anyone in your team or are you going to go, "God, no, why would any of these people take my job? Well, then I'd have a serious think about how you answered that because you are going to be stuck in that job forever. So who's your next replacement? And when you are recruiting your next team member, would there be someone you'd be happy to hand the reins over to?

Christine Laperriere:
Those are some fantastic words of wisdom. So all I can say is thank you so much for being on the show.

Rob Hartnett:
Hey, it's been fantastic, Christine. It's so good to connect with you again, really liked it.

Title: Lead yourself first
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Kim Fletcher

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at ChristineLaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere. Today, I've invited Kim Fletcher to come on the show and talk to us about her best boss. And a little bit about Kim, real quick. I've had the opportunity to work with her when she was a leader at KPMG and now as she's a leader at World Vision. One of the things I like about Kim is she's a very values based leader. I really appreciate that about the way that she thinks about the world and she thinks about the bigger picture. And then she leads her team to success. So I'm very thankful I've had the opportunity to work with you quite a few times now, Kim. And I'm so glad you're on the show. Thanks for joining me.

Kim Fletcher:
Oh, Christine. Thank you for having me. It's a delight to have worked with you for probably about 10 years now.

Christine Laperriere:
Can't believe we're getting that young. So Kim, just as we're getting started, your role at World Vision today is?

Kim Fletcher:
I'm Vice President of Philanthropy and Partnerships. It's basically a marketing role, but focused in on fundraising.

Christine Laperriere:
Beautiful. So when I asked you to be on the show, it sounded like someone came to mind. So who is your best boss ever?

Kim Fletcher:
Oh, thank you, Christine. I think you said once a best boss is someone, whoever forever impacts you for the better. And that made me think of my first boss. She led a manufacturing business, she was also the VP of sales and I was on her marketing team, my very first job. Looking back, I would characterize her as a servant leader. Though, back then, I hadn't heard that way of describing a corporate leader, so it was new for me. But true to being a servant leader, she really set the vision, she said our direction, our goals. And she saw it as her responsibility to make sure that we were all super clear on how these vision, directions and goals related to our roles. But that was the extent of her hierarchy.

Kim Fletcher:
After that, she really turned the traditional hierarchy pyramid upside down. She led from the ground up, serving us as her team. We felt included and listened to, all ideas were welcome. And whenever we needed help, she was really there to unblock our barriers. And one of the things that impressed me as young in my career was she visibly set time in her calendar to be available for coaching us and to support us. She was very results orientated, but that meant she still put people ahead of results, no matter what. And as a result, we really became this high morale team. We had high performance metrics and I learned from her something that I've taken with me forever. And that is, leadership is something leaders do alongside people and they don't do it from a distance.

Kim Fletcher:
And one story that came to mind was that she was designing a new product. And she wanted everyone from the plant production team to the marketing and sales team to provide ideas on the product features and the launch. It was her vision that when we launched this, customers would say, "Yes, this new product helps me where others products don't." To be authentic to what customer pain points our customers were having. She loaded everyone up on two big coach buses and we drove to the state, took about three or four hours. And then she divided us into small groups where we had permission to walk the entire customer operations. And we had one question to ask, and that was, how can we help you?

Kim Fletcher:
Well, Christine, we launched more than just a new product from this trip. We re-imagined everything from our shipping container labels to our quality control reports, to even how we put language and images and instructions in our sales collateral. And that to me, was an amazing insight in terms of what it is to be a servant leader. To really go out and serve your customers, but really serve your staff, as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So that's so interesting. So everybody went on this, so two full bus fulls of people. So who's going with it? Is it the whole sales team, marketing team, everybody?

Kim Fletcher:
Even people who were on the lines, making the product. Because one of the things she believed was that if we had a deeper insight of what our customers are doing with our products, even the production line folks would make the products slightly different. They would come away with insights on how we could change the features to better serve our customers.

Kim Fletcher:
And that's how we found out, for instance, at the warehouse of the customers, that how we were sending our products, our shipping labels just weren't helpful of them to know what was the freshest product or if there was a different variation. And that really was insight that made them go back as a production team, they would never have been involved in that conversation. And the customer shipping team said, what an amazing help that small change was in addition to the new product. That alone was worth the whole trip for us coming. And we would never have been on that if she hadn't packed us up and taken us.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. You hear the metaphor all the time, getting everyone on the bus. And this is so literal.

Kim Fletcher:
So very literal. And it was a wonderful way for us to bond as a team. Three or four hours on a bus with your peers that you may not see in different plants is an opportunity to share your own stories and your life, and to really get to know people as people.

Christine Laperriere:
This is excellent. So what other stories come to mind when you think of that leader? And I love this servant leadership principle. So, what else did you see her do?

Kim Fletcher:
Well, my best boss was a former elite athlete. In fact, she was at the Olympic level. So she wasn't her very nature, personally driven, and she wanted to win as a team, it was in her DNA. And she had a very coach-like style and she would ... and I know you'll appreciate this. She had a drip, drip approach to giving advice. Particularly to younger people in her team, such as myself. And she would always just infuse it in the conversations and so you never felt like you were being lectured to, or told or coached. It was just a part of constant ongoing learning.

Kim Fletcher:
She's given advice that has stuck with me for my whole career. Three in particular. The first was, lead yourself first. She would say, "You can't always control the outcomes in your life, but you are always part of the influencing processes that decide that outcome." And so if you're leading yourself first, you can control how you react to those outcomes. And people want to be led by people who are leading themselves well. And she modeled that for us. And so I've already kind of picked that up. The second she said is, "Be confident in what you know. And be curious by you don't know." And to this day, I still ask a lot of questions. I read every morning, I invest in my own, in my team's professional development so that we can infuse those new learnings into all we do.

Kim Fletcher:
The third thing she said, which was very practical, was, "High performers hire other high performers." Well, I got to say it being 24, at first, I was just thrilled she thought I was a high performer and got some positive feedback. And then I kind of really dug down and heard the additional responsibilities she was saying to me, because I was, at that time, hiring a co-op student. That I needed to really hire people that maybe I would work for one day. And if I kept that always top of mind, then I would want people to join the organization. And my team specifically, that could be mentored, who could grow and flourish. And maybe one day I could work for them and I'd be proud to do that. Those three pieces of advice have been ones that you look back at, what is a good boss? It's someone who's peppered you with all of these pearls of wisdom that you can take forward yourself. And it's helped shaped my career in many of my conversations with my staff.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and the thing is too, is that the leaders who pepper the wisdom in, the only reason it sticks is because you saw them live it. We've had lots of leaders pepper wisdom at us before, but I think the reason that I'm hearing that this made an impact on you is because she also lived these principles and then you could see them in action.

Kim Fletcher:
Oh, absolutely. And then one exercise she had us do. I don't know, you've probably read the book, Stephen Covey's, Good to Great, it's pretty much a classic. At that time we had to read it, we had to do that exercise of writing a eulogy. And I don't know if you've ever did that, but at 24, that was really not top of my mind. But it really caused me to think like, "What did I want the people who mattered most to me to think about me after I was gone?" And that's where we got into the conversation of purpose. Like what was my purpose in life? What did I want my life to represent?

Kim Fletcher:
You pick up quotes in your life. And the one that kind of came through me through this process was, "To the world, you maybe one person. But to one person, you can be the world." And that really became my mantra to this day. In fact, at one point my kids had it inscribed on the back of a new iPhone when you could do that a few years ago as a Christmas present. Just to remind me that I need to always be mindful. You can do big things with many people, but really you often can just do amazing things with one person if you focus and you don't pass them by.

Christine Laperriere:
That is a fantastic one. And it's so interesting when you mentioned that, I actually remember doing my eulogy. I took a Franklin Covey course, one of my first courses in my first internship. And it was exactly that, they started with it and it never has left my mind. I've thought about that, I mean, I must have been 21 years old and I remember that so distinctly.

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah, it's a great exercise. And one that anyone can do today because it really forces you down to like, what is your key leadership essence? And what are you as a person within the context of the current humanity?

Christine Laperriere:
What's going to be your impact in the world? What is the thing you're going to leave when you're not here anymore?

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah, that's awesome. And the other thing that I took away when you asked me about best boss was really, Proctor and Gamble, I worked for them for a few years. And there was a lot of great bosses, but we talk about best boss. Sometimes that can be institutionalized. Proctor and Gamble had a training program and one of the things that they taught their leaders was to focus in on key learnings. And it's funny, my husband was a vendor of Proctor and Gamble and as I was getting ready for this, he said the same thing. He said, "I remember Proctor and Gamble having key learnings." And if you made a mistake, you can't change the past again, it's kind of theme in my best bosses. But you can look forward and what could you do better and differently in the future?

Kim Fletcher:
So one of the characteristics of a best boss that my husband and I both saw, particularly in Proctor and Gamble, as an example. Is the people who don't dwell on the past mistakes, who just dust it off and say, "Okay, what are you going to do going for forward?" But key learnings can also be to like, "What worked really well?" Because sometimes you don't quite know, it's magical, the price, the customer, the environment. Well, it's how can you replicate that again to have scalable and repeatable success? So the other thing I would just add was this whole key learning. And it was just interesting to go from my best boss to a best boss practice. And how those two can be inter-fused.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that. I particularly like that because sometimes in coaching, when you do slow down and ask what worked there or what didn't work? A lot of people feel like it's luck. They point to the context of the situation, they don't point to what's repeatable.

Kim Fletcher:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Christine Laperriere:
And so I'm always hunting for what's repeatable. What can you take from that situation that is repeatable in a future situation? So key learnings, that's a good education for me today. That's my key learning.

Kim Fletcher:
If you learn one new thing a day, I always think it's just been a great day.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. That's why I love doing the show. So this is so good. Tell me a little bit about, what's the impact of working for a best boss? So I always find people struggle with, what is the return on investment sometimes in a great leader? And I'm really trying to see if I can unpack that in this conversation. So could you help me understand, what is the impact in your mind? Whether it's to the metrics, into the business or to the people. What's the impact of working for a best boss ever?

Kim Fletcher:
One of the things my best boss taught me was that when you look out across the Canadian corporate landscape or whatever sector that you're working in. And you can see the people that you have invested in and they, themselves are now contributing. That is really a measure of success. It may not be something that wins you award. But it's something that when you go home at night, that you can say, "I had a small part in that person's career to better them, to help them be successful."

Kim Fletcher:
So one of the things we're doing with best bosses is that they are replicating themselves in the marketplace. And so we have future leaders. The other thing I find with the best boss is they build high performing teams. People want to work for them. So you increase retention, you have higher morale. So people work better, smarter. And they also will work in a more unified way. And that generally develops higher metrics and results at the end because you're all pulling information. You want to win as a team, you want to cross the finish line as a team. If you train and you run, quite often running coaches will have you run and the fastest person who crosses the line, they make them loop back to the slowest person as the line. And you keep looping back. A, because they get more exercise. But it also means at the end, all of the runners cross the finish line together. And that's what I think a best boss does. Is we do have individual successes, but ultimately the team and the organization finishes together. And that's what we really celebrate.

Christine Laperriere:
What a cool concept. I love it. That's great. So with that, tell me a little bit ... I'm thinking about what counter leadership experiences have you had? So maybe not necessarily a worst boss, but what are some of the things that you've seen that you know don't work as well as what you saw your best boss do?

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah. I think one of the least favorite traits of mine and probably of many people's is when a leader's talk and walk don't align. They say one thing, that their own actions don't reflect what they say. And that can come in the form of micromanagement, feeling a lack of trust, feeling that you're out there, but you're maybe not supported. And I think that's where you can see people feel just not sure they're going to give their best. And I don't think it's intentional. It's just that there's not sort of that openness to give it your all. Because there may or may not be the safety net, there may not be the joy or the laughter in that.

Kim Fletcher:
It's funny. I had a boss who I knew of, and he brought me onto his team. And he knew of me, but we hadn't really met in a personal way. And we were sitting down over our initial meetings and he said, "Yeah, I really like to empower my staff." And part of my like light went on and go, "Oh, is this where you just tell me I'm empowered, but I'm not really empowered? Are you really empowering me?" And he was awesome. He knew I liked a challenge.

Kim Fletcher:
And so he flipped over at napkin, we were at lunch. And he wrote two numbers on the back. And he slid it across the table and he said, "Listen, go do those two things." He said, "I am here to support you and ask any questions you want of me. If I don't hear from you, I assume that you're doing great things." He said, "Get those two numbers done. That's what the business needs to have happened. And there'd be great rewards. Don't get those two." He says, "Just slip me back your resignation." And I kind of went, "Oh wow. That's like real empowerment." He kind of laughed and he sort of said, "You kind of get what I mean." He wasn't quite so serious on the resignation.

Kim Fletcher:
But it was really just, I trust you to go do what your level and your experiences and your capabilities, just go get this done. And I have to tell you, it was so much fun. I did go to him for advice. I did go to him to help me out in certain situations to remove barriers. But I really embraced what he told me and that was, "I want you to be empowered." And that as an individual and a leader, I look back and say, "Boy, you really walked your talk. You didn't have to do that, but you wanted to do that and you trusted me to do it." And that was pretty exciting.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and when I hear that, I hear true intrapreneurship. Which we talk about, we have all these people that are leaving the corporate world and going out and starting their own small practices. And it's because they want the autonomy. They have a sense of "entrepreneurship" but I'm hearing a lot of people don't know how to foster intrapreneurship, which is having a lot of autonomy inside of an organization. So I just heard that and went to me, that's intrapreneurship.

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah, very much. I think that there's a balance between having guardrails and then feeling someone's being sort of trapped. Guardrails are helpful to say, "Let's get together every quarter and review your metrics and see how you're doing. And then let me know if I can support you along the way." That can feel like a challenging situation, or it can feel like a show and tell.

Kim Fletcher:
And when you get to those meetings, it's really about, "Am I asking for help? And do I get help?" And that really is that what you're talking about, is feeling that sense of intrapreneurship. Is that in between those quarterly meetings, I'm empowered to make choices, I'm empowered to get help, or I'm empowered to flourish in my own uniqueness, bring my skillsets to bear. And then on the quarter, I get together just to make sure that I'm aligned or if I need more support, that it's already there for me. And I think as more organizations move to that type of agility, we'll start to see more people thrive in that entrepreneurship.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. And then, I mean, just circling back to what you mentioned as well about the not best boss, that lack of ability to walk your talk. And it just made me think back to your best bosses, lead yourself first. So if you have those mantras and you have those leadership principles that you want everyone else to behave and abide by, you lead that first. You demonstrate those capabilities first and then you let everybody see how it's done versus just talking it.

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah. And if you lead with purpose, then people know where you're going. It's very clear, your values, in that decisions that you make and how you engage with people. Because it's true to who you are as a person.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. And so, I guess, if you had to teach or advise some future leaders, I know I've got a lot that listen to this show. They're out there and they're working hard. They're coming out of the pandemic, so we've been working home for a year and a half and people are trying to figure out how to manage remote teams. They're trying to figure out how to manage people who might even be thinking about leaving the organization because we do have so much turnover happening right now. What would be your words of wisdom for those folks who are listening right now?

Kim Fletcher:
If I go back to one of the pieces of advice earlier, I would lean on this. Be confident in what you know, and be curious by what you don't know. You know, as leaders, that you are really strong in certain areas. You've had great experiences and great capabilities. And where you don't know something, be authentic in saying, "I don't know much about virtual working from home. I don't know how to manage someone's individual stress with young children or aging parents. But I'm here to ask some questions, how can I help you? How can I get you help?" And then as you ask those questions, you will learn and it'll move to the category of, be confident in what you know. And if you keep with that piece of advice, I find you can weather just about any business or personal up or down.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. Thank you, Kim. Do you have anything else you want to share just before we wrap?

Kim Fletcher:
I would just like to thank you, Christine. I mean, I've learned from you as well, and it's great to see something that I learned decades ago and you working with myself and my teams in terms of drip, drip. And I think it's important that when we are leading others, we can do these intensive, let's get together and learn something sessions. But it's really, as we walk along those paths together that we learn the most. And so I would just continue for myself and for you and for your listeners to really be teaching and learning all along with your staff. Because that's really where you build those relationships and that's where I think people feel they can bring their whole self to work because you get to know who they are.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Thank you so much, Kim. Thanks for coming on the show.

Title: Christine speaks about being a parentpreneur
Host: Jenelu Payne
Guest: Christine Laperriere

Jenelu Payne:
Hey everyone. Welcome back to the Generational Wealth Summit. And today we have Miss Christine Laperriere and she is the president of Leader In Motion, an organization focused on developing high-potential leadership talent with special expertise supporting women in leadership. She authored a number one Amazon best seller title called Too Busy to Be Happy: A Guide to Using Emotional Real Estate to Grow Your Work-Life-Wisdom. Parentrepreneurs, please welcome the one and only Christine Laperriere.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. That was an awesome intro.

Jenelu Payne:
I really love the topic for today and the topic is the best wealth practices for parents, business and family. And I know that you are the perfect person for this topic, and I am just so excited to have you with us.

Christine Laperriere:
Looking forward to it.

Jenelu Payne:
So many entrepreneurs feel like if they ever stop to take a break, they will lose money. Where do you think this belief comes from?

Christine Laperriere:
There are so many layers to why I think this happens, but the first one that I think, I call it two-dimensional thinking about time. So we think of time equaling money, and we're kind of taught that from an early age, because we take hourly jobs where time equals money. In all fairness, many of us, as entrepreneurs, immediately think to ourselves, "Well, if we want to make double or triple what we just made in our hourly job, we're going to have to work double or triple the hours." And we sign up for it because we get into businesses we're passionate about, and we love that opportunity to create. So it's a little bit of wiring and DNA mixed with a little bit of what I'll call failed logic on the physics of how we create money.

Jenelu Payne:
Now, what is the tangible result of this way of thinking?

Christine Laperriere:
Obviously, there can be some great results, because we know some entrepreneurs who have created just amazing things and changed the world. And so there's obviously some good to it. But on the flip side, I think, as a apparent entrepreneur, and even prior to that burnout, is the thing that so many of us face. It's interesting when I think about it, my brother is a musician and was always scared to become an entrepreneur musician, for fear of falling out of love with something that he was so in love with.

Jenelu Payne:
Wow.

Christine Laperriere:
So I think about it and I go, burnout's definitely the number one challenge, but the fear of falling out of love was something that drove us to want to be entrepreneurs in the first place. I think that's scary.

Jenelu Payne:
You're right. It's definitely scary. It really is. And you know what? A lot of times, us, as parents, we seem to get burned out so easily because we've got a lot of things coming at us at one time. We have a business and that's our baby, as well as our babies. But all of this really burns us out. Why should we take time away from our businesses?

Christine Laperriere:
I'm going to start by rephrasing that question. I love this question, but as soon as you say to an entrepreneur, "Should we take time away?" You got to think of us. We're a little bit like addicts with using our time to create a business. What I actually am a advocate of, and I talk about this in Too Busy To Be Happy, is this concept of understanding what your emotional real estate is. So it's the energy, the fixed amount of budgeted energy, that we all have to manage everything that's coming bad us in life. So, things with kids, things with unknowns, things with spouses, conflict, change, just trying to build healthy habits, uses a lot of emotional real estate. Dealing with my three and a half year old son who has decided he's boycotting sleep this week, that uses up a lot of emotional real estate and then trying to manage a business and even fear of the unknown uses a lot of emotional real estate.

Christine Laperriere:
So what I really would say is I pay attention to activities that give back more emotional real estate than they take. And so what I would advocate for is instead of thinking of it as taking time away from the business, I would talk about it as investing time in doing activities that give back more energy than they take. Just like I was saying to you as we start started the show, 20 minutes on the treadmill today, just to give myself a chance to catch my breath and get a little bit of movement. That activity gave more energy back than it took. And that's where I feel like it's not about taking time away from my business, it's actually about investing in activities that give me energy back, that allow me to use that as a budget against my business.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that approach. Now, when you work from home though, as most of us do, some of us, parents, it can get hard. Now, do you have any tips for that?

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I will say working from home, it's a very unique challenge. When I started my business in 2008, a couple of things that I did that really helped, so I had a dedicated office space, everything work related stayed in that space, even though it wasn't a [inaudible 00:05:32] room, it was kind of my little den, leveraged the power of habit, because now we're using our unconscious mind to get things done. So, habit is powerful. So I used to wake up every day and make my coffee, walk my dog, all that good stuff, and by nine o'clock, I was always in my office and I was always seated at my desk, getting ready to work. And what I found is then, at the end of the day, I would then get up, move away and go somewhere else in the house.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, I am a big advocate for don't work in your living room, even if it is just a desk, and that desk is your anchor for where you work. Just being very mindful because the brain is a funny thing. So, if you sit down with the same exact desk every day with the intention of work, your brain was start to do that and perpetuate that for you. And so anything you can do to build some habit. I found noise-canceling headphones to be absolute savior, still going back and using the same office space and really teaching the kids to stay away from that desk, kind of teaching them what that meant, helping your family start to recognize what those routines look like and what those rituals look like. So that it makes them easier for them to know what the ground rules are.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that you said that you have to create habits because this is so important for us, as parents, entrepreneurs, any of us. It's so important for us. And I remember the saying "Repetition is the mother of skills". So if you continue to just do this routine while you're at home, then eventually things will become natural. Christine, with your expertise, what would be the number one best wealth practice advice you would give to parents who are entrepreneurs and why?

Christine Laperriere:
It's an interesting one. The first that I think of is to always have six months to a year of salary in your bank account, as soon as you can achieve it. Again, I understand the difference between a startup and a long term business, they are two different things. So if you just started your business yesterday, don't be disappointed, it's coming. But to think very consciously, when I began my business, I thought very strategically about paying myself a salary. Fortunately, I was around a lot of other entrepreneurs and I got a chance to learn some of these tips from them, but I paid myself a salary that was a little bit under what I was actually making and just kind of learnt to live on that salary, again, once I got my business off the ground. And what I found is that six months to a year of savings does this incredible thing where you make more clear and conscious decisions around your business, you fire the bad customers.

Christine Laperriere:
It's almost like if you think of driving a car, it's like, if you're constantly terrified that you're going to run out of gas, like you're swerving to the left, you're swerving to the right, you're driving like a maniac, but if you know you have a little something in the tank, there's no need to overreact. I started my business in 2008, so I think it was very good advice. But once I had a little bit of cash in the bank and I didn't ever treat that as spending money, that is my salary, that's kind of my extra run rate for my salary. So if I have a bad month or a customer doesn't pay or something happens, I'm going to be fine next week, it's going to be fine. So it allows me to handle those decisions without overreacting or even being emotional in those situations, because I know the sky's not going to fall.

Christine Laperriere:
And then perfect example of this was recreated because when the pandemic hit, I have a business where I'm on site a lot with large companies, and first thing that happens when crisis hits is large companies cut budget for all leadership development and investment in their people, unfortunately that a lot of them do. And second thing that happens is when all your work is on site, all of it gets canceled, so there's nothing for me to build. So it was a classic example of this. I had a year's worth of cash in the bank as part of my business strategy. I've done that for 13 years. I kind of just looked at my husband, I'm looking at my kids and I'm like, "Well, we're good for a year. We got a year to figure this out." And he's looking at me going, "Well, most pandemics last 18 months." and I'm going [inaudible 00:09:43]. But that said, I mean, it was just nice to not have that on top of everything else. And it would've been so easy to live the lifestyle that would've used up that whole budget. But the point is protect that. I'm always thinking about that, how many months of advance am I good for, when I do my budgeting and my financing.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that. That is the best advice.

Christine Laperriere:
Think about the benefits of decision making when you're not on under stress, when you're not scared about feeding your kids next week. You make better decisions. As a parent, when you think you're not going to be able to feed your kids, you act crazy, which is normal in nature, mother nature lets us do that. But it makes being a parent, you're going to be quick to throw in the towel, you're going to be quick to go for somebody, you're going to be quick to make stupid decisions, you know?

Jenelu Payne:
You're right. I can really agree to that because like you said, when you are at that level of stress, you really don't think properly. And also it's not giving you time to be free to create for your children, for your legacy. It's just really hard on top of that. So it's really and truly the best advice that you can give someone is to make sure that, "Hey, you are really secure." And that way you can have that peace of mind because us, as parents, we long for a peace of mind. What are some systems or strategies that we can put in place that will help entrepreneurs have a better work life and family life balance?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. I mean the one thing that I'm really thoughtful of and I really point the phrase "Work-life-wisdom". So I always say work life balance is the wrong long term because nothing is 50-50 and my days never look 50-50 to be honest. But what I do know, and I would encourage every parent to get really clear on, is what their work life wisdom looks like. So what is it that you specifically need, in your situation, given who you are and what makes you happy? What do you need to make it all work? So, for example, for me, I have two very young children and I'm in that particular phase right now. So they're not teenagers, they're not eating at friends' houses or anything. And I want to have dinner with my family every night. So, before the pandemic, my rule was I only wanted one night in which I would not eat with my family.

Christine Laperriere:
And that meant if I was going out of town for a speaking engagement or to teach, I wanted to take the last flight out that night and I would try to make sure that I was back within 24 to 48 hours. But I would try to have dinner with my kids four out of five nights a week. And that was just what my work life wisdom was. So if I was planning any kind of travel, like if I was planning to be somewhere, I'd even plan to be in the conference, I'd ask them to put me up in the afternoon versus the morning, because my work life wisdom tells me, as soon as I miss two meals with my kids in a week, I feel like a disconnected mom. I can live without feeding them breakfast or I can miss more breakfast, but something about that dinner time is really important to me.

Christine Laperriere:
For me, that's my work-life-wisdom. I might go back to work after the kids go to bed. But I also am really conscious of... I like to have a couple hours a week where George and I watch Netflix together at nine o'clock at night with no kids around. And for us, that's our time to just hang out as friends and just be partners and not have the pressure of our children around. And so I kind of have a couple of these things that are very important, sacred work life wisdom activities, and it might not look 50-50. So if I took the hours I dedicate to my business to the hours of these practices, they're not 50-50. There's probably 20 hours of real life happening here and there's easily 50 hours of business. But they're so important to me because when I look at myself in the mirror, that's how I get to feel like I'm a committed mom, committed partner, and that I'm living my best life and I'm living the life that I'm here for. I'm not chained to my business at the expense of everything.

Jenelu Payne:
Oh, yeah. That is so good. Everything that you said, it really resonate with me as well, as a parent and an entrepreneur. I also feel that it if you have that balance, you won't get so burned out. What do you do when you can't handle the life you've created and wish you had more time?

Christine Laperriere:
As you get further into being an entrepreneur, starting to ask 'who?', not 'how?', becomes a really important question. So I have easily six or seven different people who have very specific expertise that I pay to do their magic. And to me, that's what being an entrepreneur should be. It's like we get paid to do our magic. It's not a time thing, we're getting paid to do the thing that we are particularly talented in, but that's exactly it. So having people paid to do the things that use up a lot of emotional real estate, for me, is huge. Use the money that you do make to help balance out that energy. Don't be afraid to... Again, ask 'who', not 'how', especially as you get a little further in and you've got a little bit more financial resources.

Jenelu Payne:
Oh, yeah, definitely. I love that you said the 'who', not the 'how', because I think a lot of us as entrepreneurs, we always want to do everything for ourselves at first. Now, you are an Amazon bestselling author, with the book called Too Busy to Be Happy. Now, tell us more about this book and why should we get it?

Christine Laperriere:
Sure. I mean, one thing that I talk about in the book, you'll definitely hear me talk about being an entrepreneur and stress management. So I think that might be one of the biggest reasons right there, but the thing is it's a bit of a cautionary tale of burnout and what that looks like, because high performing, hard workers, we are at risk for burnout. And my own experience is just a perfect example of that. In 2007, I went through kind of a breakup and too many promotions and all of a sudden I'm managing teams in two different countries and I'm flying I'm back and forth and all this kind of thing, and didn't know how to shut things off and eventually found myself in a doctor's office. And after numerous tests, the doctor says, "Well, you just got to learn to manage your stress better. Oh, and or here's a prescription for Ativan."

Christine Laperriere:
And then it kind of got worse. And I really woke up one day staring at the ceiling, wondering if it would be good if I could just get sick so that I could have permission to leave my work. And so I tell that story because it's something that so easily happens. And it's interesting, the first time I told that story was 2012, I got asked to teach a class called Mastering Me for women of influence, I was so vulnerable telling this story. I was shaking. This is such an embarrassing thing to admit, right? But I had people come up to me at the end of that class and say, "I'm there. And I'm there right now. And I really understand that story." And then I started telling it more and more.

Christine Laperriere:
So I got asked to do more speaking gigs and even a very large room, I almost always have 10 to 12 people that walk up to me, not just to say, "Thanks for speaking," but who say, "That has happened to me. That exact thing has happened to me. And I thought I was the only person that had ever happened to." And so my argument number one is this, just learn to manage your stress better, nobody understands what that actually is. And so I started to put... I went on a mission to really understand, how do high performing really hardcore people learn how to [inaudible 00:17:44] manage our stress better. And I really did get some very useful tools in there about ways to break things down and categorize them. So you can really understand what's happening. And it's not just your usual stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
I hate to say this, I love Oprah, I'm a giant Oprah fan, but when I get an Oprah blog and it's like, "Meditate more. Go to yoga." You know what? I put meditate on my calendar and now I'm missing my meditation and I'm even more stressed. It's just one more failure, one more thing that I'm missing that day that I should have gotten done. And so I have found that I had to come up with a completely different way of thinking of stress management and how I get out in front of it, because just saying, "Take time to meditate," or "Take time to yoga," or "Take time do this," that wasn't enough for me, it didn't work enough. So I needed a larger, broader system to work. And that's really what I work on in the book.

Jenelu Payne:
I love this. And it is so good that we have someone like you, Christine, to make us aware of this and be okay with talking about it. Now, this is a question that I ask anyone that I interview. Now, what does building a wealthy legacy means to you?

Christine Laperriere:
I thought about that question and something snapped in me a little bit because I was kind of going down the path of money and wealth and here's one of the things struggle with a little bit, it's that I've read over and over again that generational wealth is often lost by the next generation, so one of the things that I'm actually more passionate about than creating generational wealth, I know you asked of wealth legacy, and this is kind of how I think about it, is I really want my kids and to be honest, one of my passion projects to do this for more kids than just my own, but I want to teach kids how to fish. Like, I want to teach them the mindset that actually builds wealth for them personally. And I think this is so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
Like, in a previous life, I was with somebody who had a daughter and I was trying to teach her why walking dogs in exchange for money was a really good thing. And she's like, "Well, I would walk the dogs for free. Because I love the dogs." And I'm like, "That's exactly the type of activity we want you to get paid for." Because that to me is a wealthy legacy, getting paid for the thing that you like doing, to begin with. And also teaching her how she can truly have whatever she wants, if she's willing to be creative about how she earns wealth, to make those things happen. So I really had a bit of a rich dad, poor dad, experience in my own life where my dad came out of Corporate America and he worked that salary job for 30 years and did all the right things. And that did create a very nice lifestyle. But then as I went into management consulting, I was around a lot of self-made millionaires. And so I watched their mindset and the way they raised their kids and they taught their kids how to start businesses, and they taught their kids how to get paid for things that they had passion for. And they taught their kids how to build scale. And I'm like, "To me, that's going to be my legacy."

Jenelu Payne:
Absolutely. Oh, my goodness. You know what, Christine? You're so on point, because this is the subject that I really love to talk about, as far as leaving a wealthy legacy. And to me, like you said, teaching children how to fish, teaching different strategies on how to build a business, things of that nature. I am so passionate about it because, hey, our children are our future. And if we teach this to them right now, then they'll be able to teach their kids so on and so forth. That's the biggest meaning of building a wealthy legacy.

Christine Laperriere:
I'll not be teaching them how to find somebody to work for and just hold on tight and never lose that job for 30 years. It won't be that lesson. It'll be, sure go work for somebody if you want to work for somebody, but you stay empowered, you do it because it feels good and it's the right use of your time. And if you go work for a terrible boss, pack up your stuff and go be so valuable that you can work anywhere else.

Jenelu Payne:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
That's the kind of lesson. I want you to be empowered. You're not going to be at the mercy of everything because honestly, I mean, who knows how much wealth I'll leave to my children. But if they know how to fish, they'll be wealthy forever.

Jenelu Payne:
Be wealthy forever and that's the key. Oh, my goodness. Christine, it was such a pleasure.

Christine Laperriere:
Love the topic. You know what? I love it. I think that I like the concept of parents, I like that it's inclusive of both men and women because lots of men are in the same boat as a lot of us women. And I think it's very cool, what you're doing.

Jenelu Payne:
Thank you so much. It was such an honor to interview you.Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast


Episode: 3
Title: Empowering to be you
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Kim Carlin

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
All right. Kim, thank you so much for being on the show. This is such a pleasure. And just before we get started, I'm going to just mention why I invited you to come onto the show. And it's really because I had the luxury of working with you years and years ago in the same consulting firm. And it was just so neat because people would say to me, as I was new to the organization, "Oh, it looks like you're going to be the next Kim." And so it's such a neat thing because I've just had the chance to work with you and I look up to you so much. It was such a compliment.

Christine Laperriere:
I remember early in my career it being such a compliment for people to say that they could picture me filling the shoes one day of Kim Carlin. So it just made sense to have you on the Best Boss Ever show and hear a bit about your perspective on different bosses that you've worked with in the consulting world, different bosses that you've worked for, just some of your perspectives on leadership given now that you're in a leadership capacity yourself.

Kim Carlin:
Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm excited. So maybe just to start, do you want to give a little bit of context around your career and how you've seen leadership unfold?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah, absolutely. So as you know I've had a lot long career in management consulting. I started my career in a small boutique firm right out of my MBA. So I was pretty new to the world of management at that time. I accelerated through the ranks over the course of the first five, eight years, moved my way up to managing partner in the firm and ultimately was responsible for global business development.

Kim Carlin:
So I reported into one of the founding partners, had a team of people working for me as well as had the luxury of working in over 200 businesses all over the world in virtually every different industry. So that has been a really great experience. And then most recently I transitioned out of my consulting career, moved over to the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, where I've been working there on executive coaching, teaching a leadership development curriculum to executive MBA students. And that's again, been a really fascinating experience working with that cohort of people, future emerging leaders.

Kim Carlin:
And then most recently I've taken a leadership position with CIBC. So I'm going to be supporting them with a transformation effort over the next five years. So that's a little bit of background to me. I have a undergraduate degree in sociology and MBA in strategy and a PhD where I focused exclusively on leadership development and in particular female executive leaders, which is important part of interest for me.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. An Important niche. So then given that, when we talk about that whole idea of best boss ever, I'm curious in your work experience, you probably had the experience of working for, let's say a best boss, but also I know you worked in that small boutique firm for a long time. So what was your perspective on some of the leadership that you observed there and the culture?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah, that's a terrific question. I think growing up in consulting is a little bit of a unique background from a leadership standpoint. So consulting by its very nature is extraordinarily competitive. And I think our firm wasn't different in that regard. We had a culture very heavily male dominated in the early days of the firm. I was the only woman in the firm, a lot of folks that had come from competitive sports environment. So it was this real, highly competitive jock masculine type of culture. I would almost say that the leadership style was punitive in nature.

Kim Carlin:
So there was a bit of a fear, results were everything. You could go from hero to zero really quickly. So I would actually, if I was to be extraordinarily candid, probably suggest that what I learned about leadership from within my organization was the type of leader I didn't want to be. So the fact that I felt that there were gaps in terms of how I was treated, in terms of the way that I was ultimately respected.

Kim Carlin:
And I think that was a big learning for me was to be different in my own leadership style, to be more true to myself, which would've been more interested in engagement, more interested in knowing my staff, more interested in letting them be creative, take risks, et cetera, than the way I was actually managed.

Kim Carlin:
So I think that's an interesting background in terms of my experience with my own personal boss. Certainly over my career in consulting I worked in lots of environments with clients that I would say were great representations of best bosses, people that really took a genuine interest in their staff really had true engagement from their staff.

Kim Carlin:
And even my experience at Rotman over the course of the last three years had a leader there that she was extraordinarily results focused as well, very strong personality type, but valued inclusivity, valued everyone having a voice at the table. Very much was about us being creative, taking risks, creating a culture where risk was rewarded and succeed or fail. It was really about learning. And I felt that that was quite different from, call it my 15 year history in consulting. It was actually quite refreshing. So I think that my own leadership style has really been developed from this unique facet of different kinds of leaders that I've had experience with over the course of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you give me some examples, when you think of that experience with your leader at Rotman, when you talk about risk taking, being rewarded, can you just share a little more detail about what does that look like?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Absolutely. So part of my responsibility there was developing programs and curriculum to support our executive MBA programs. And in fact, the program that I was working in was a brand new program for executives in the health and life science sector. So we were kind of inventing the program. The thinking was, is that most of these folks that were in the program were already pretty advanced in their career so they would already be pretty established leaders.

Kim Carlin:
So one of the things that we found out pretty quickly was that some of the deficiencies, even from these people that on the outside would look to be highly successful, highly accomplished, were the same as any leader that we're dealing with like lots of issues around confidence, lots of issues around personal brand, lots of issues around how to network and how to strategically align yourself within your organization.

Kim Carlin:
So my boss in particular there really encouraged me to develop this kind of unique programming set. It was different from the more traditional management structure, the more framework academic scholarly research. So I used a lot of the work that I had done from consulting, what I learned about effective leadership style, about relationship developing from my consulting background versus the more academic slant to really help build this programming, which was quite unique actually in the Rotman experience, very good outcomes, we had really great feedback from the students.

Kim Carlin:
I think that it was highly successful. And even in my absence I have a number of people reaching out to me to find out more about those programs and how they can continue with the momentum that I generated from that. So I would say that was something that deviated from the straight and narrow of a typical academic environment. And we took a slightly different slant and she was very encouraging of me trying this new type of learning environment, which was very successful.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of a specific example from your consulting days where the leadership felt excluding? I want to talk a little bit about inclusion versus exclusion, how does that actually show up in leadership behavior? So we're busy these days, everything's about diversity and inclusion. And I just find that it shows up in certain leadership quality the feeling of being excluded or included. I want to hear what are your examples that you can think of, the difference for you about feeling included versus excluded?

Kim Carlin:
I think that some of the worst examples of exclusion were the public chastising and the public... The boss that I had was not stop short of publicly chastising you in front of a group, right? So the fear of that, if you are sitting around a boardroom table with a group of people, you hoped you weren't the one that was picked on, but that public chastising was one that certainly was live and well, it was unrelenting.

Kim Carlin:
So there was at times when he wouldn't let things go in terms of these public outcries of times when you perhaps made a mistake. In my own leadership practice now when I'm talking to leaders and talking to my own staff, it's really important for you to actually try something and fail. And if you fail, assuming it's not catastrophic, the most and important experience is what you learn from that.

Kim Carlin:
So what I feel from those public events being chastised is it meant that we were a very risk adverse culture. And it was, if the idea wasn't invented by the founding partners or the most senior members of the team, it wasn't well received. So as a result of that I think we became very myopic in our development. So we didn't have the level of creativity that you'd see in organizations the same level.

Kim Carlin:
So now that I've actually been outside of that environment, when I see the innovation, creativity and how other organizations have moved along the continuum of change and I look back and see how relatively stagnant we were from a methodology performance and outcome standpoint. I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that people were fearful. I guess I can't say other people, but people like me were fearful of truly changing status quo because of this fear of being publicly ridiculed in many ways.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, one of the things I keep noticing when I'm talking to people about the best boss ever is you learn a lot about the conversation ends up becoming a scale of what are the worst things that, not worst boss ever but maybe the worst practices ever versus the best boss ever practices. And so you end up learning a lot about the polarizing of those too.

Christine Laperriere:
So again, if you're fearful about putting innovative creative solutions on the table and we hear that as part of the cultural norm, the opposite of that again is going to be, here you are in an environment where somebody is really challenging and inviting that to the table and they're saying, "I want those creative, I ideas. I want you to take a risk. I want you to fail. I'm going to applaud your failures when you do." And for you, you're really seeing the difference between those two.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. 100%. And as you know Christine, consulting is a competitive environment. It's often an eat what you kill type environment. So rather than working in a collaborative fashion, what was encouraged in our environment was to be very highly competitive with each other. So as a result of that, we didn't have the cohesion of teamwork.

Kim Carlin:
So the public ridicule, the highly competitive environment, the real cutthroat environment, what that did to us was, make us not working I believe as strongly as a synergistic team, as we could have, which I believe now again, with hindsight being 2020, just the has better business outcomes, better superior record and better engagement.

Kim Carlin:
I stayed in this environment. Many people do stay in this environment, but I think we start to become more like those leaders and less like our true selves, which is problematic. And probably if I really dig deep, but I wasn't the kind of person I wanted to be when I was there. And I'm glad that I've had the ability to be able to recognize that in myself and pivot a little bit.

Christine Laperriere:
And then I have one last question for you, maybe a very personal question. You're in a same sex marriage or same sex relationship, and I just want to know, you obviously have interacted with so many different people in the business world. And I just know from our conversation offsite about the fact that in certain environments people would know that about you and in other environments you would hold back a little bit about your personal life. What is it about great leaders in general that would make you feel safe to share your full authentic self versus others? I'm just curious. Can you tell us a little bit about that?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Also a great question and one that I reflect on a lot. Obviously over the course of my career, it's been two decades so just society has changed and acceptance around same sex relationships has changed. So there's more openness to it today than there probably was when I started my career. I think that in general the people that... Again, it's the same people that encourage this inclusivity, that all voices at the table are the leaders that you can truly be your authentic self with.

Kim Carlin:
So if you're hiding an aspect of yourself of obviously gender or obviously race or disability, perhaps are more visible than your sexual orientation, but if you're not able to bring your whole self to the table, then you're limited in your ability, I believe to be creative, innovative and to be engaged. Now the interesting dichotomy to some of the things that I said around this highly competitive culture would make you think that that was one at which I would've been somewhat stifled in my sexual orientation, I would actually say it was quite the opposite.

Kim Carlin:
I was always encouraged to be true to who I was within the parameters of our business. But as I mentioned earlier in my career a large portion of my role was in a selling capacity, which meant that I was traveling around the world selling consulting services. And in a sales relationship, whether right or wrong, you are at the mercy of a client's decision on if they like you or not. People buy from individuals they like. And I was very careful and very guarded to be dishonest with who I was.

Kim Carlin:
I often played the gender game, talked about my partner. I actually would say husband versus a partner, certainly wasn't true to myself. But a big part at is really in the recognition that different environments you don't know what their feelings are around sexual orientation. So I think that in places that we went that would be more progressive, that would have policies around that, say financial service firms or maybe large healthcare institutions where there was prescribed policies around being open and diverse, but in many environments I wasn't being true to who I was.

Kim Carlin:
And I think it's a bit of the nature of the type of work that I did. Not saying it's right or wrong. Never was endorsed by the organization I worked for but I was self-imposed. But I'll tell you Christine now, again, being on the other side of this, being in an environment that's very highly supportive of people being completely true to themselves whatever their background is, it's just liberating and feels a lot easier just to go to work and not have to worry and look over my shoulder or play the gender pronoun game, which is just not fair to me or my partner.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, and I know just from having worked for that firm and having two leaders that were in same sex relationships. I always found it very refreshing because I felt the leadership... I just appreciated the diversity of leadership. I appreciated the fact you were the only female in the leadership team. And I guess that helped me feel like there was an opportunity for me in the future, but I also just appreciated the fact that not everybody was cut from the exact same cloth.

Christine Laperriere:
So like you said that was one of the good news part of that culture is that it did seem like they were inclusive on that front. For me, it gave the perception of the fact that you would be accepted regardless. So even if it was competitive and it had its own very specific cultural nature, just seeing some diversity in the actual people who were at the table to me always made me feel a little safer.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. I absolutely think so. And I know you and I are big proponents of having role models that we can look up to in organizations. I think that it's critically important. So I think that was always something that I felt of a strong, important burden on, not a burden in a negative way, but that it was important for me to represent myself appropriately as a female, as someone who is gay and certainly as an executive at the table.

Kim Carlin:
Either at my job now, or in other organizations that I've been part of, I think that it's important for me to represent myself appropriately because I do recognize that people will be looking up to me and looking to be... I don't want to say be like me, but certainly see a positive representation of someone from those types of communities.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And now you have the opportunity now to make other people see that it's possible and that they can be fully who they are without having to, like you said, edit their commentary or hold back a piece of who they are, or if you're at a dinner table with a bunch of clients not having to feel like you have to edit something about your personal life just to fit in, you have the opportunity set that stage where you... Like you said, you experienced your own editing along the way.

Kim Carlin:
That's right?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Kim Carlin:
That's right. There weren't a lot of role models for me 20 years ago. Lots of trailblazers were blazing paths in other industries, in our small firm that wasn't the case. But I'm proud to say that I was and certainly you were part of the trail blazing female group in that organization. And I think we've got a lot to be proud of.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I wonder too just when I reflect upon what you're talking about, when I think of inclusion and how competitive that environment was. I wonder if the intense competitiveness about making sure that you always won the deal was part of what made you insecure about or made you feel like you needed to edit some parts. Because like you said that piece of just you didn't want to risk the deal over you being authentic.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. I think that's absolutely it, right? And like I said no one ever told me to do that. I was never forced to do that but that intent competitiveness, the entire reward and compensation structure was predicated on you selling at all cost. So therefore you did everything, the good sales people did everything they could to put their best foot forward. And I made a judgment call that that's what it required for me. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt that perhaps there was lots of environments I didn't need to do that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Kim Carlin:
But frankly, I felt I did and I had a very successful track record. I don't think it had anything to do with my sexual orientation one way or the other, I hope it had to do with my skill. But it wasn't a risk that at least at that stage I was willing to take-

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Kim Carlin:
Now, yeah, different but that's-

Christine Laperriere:
Well, let's hope that eventually the day comes when putting your best foot forward is that you can completely share all of those things and be, that is your best foot forward. But I completely understand what you're saying because a lot has shifted in 20 years around the perceptions and beliefs around this. Thank you so much for sharing so vulnerably, like I said, I knew I was going to challenge you with some tough questions. So I love-

Kim Carlin:
I wouldn't expect anything you ask Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. I love the fact that you let me go there and ask those questions and I do think people are going to get some great value out of hearing your stories and how your journey has unfolded and how you've learned about what that best boss ever looks like for you now that you move forward.

Kim Carlin:
Thanks. Thanks. Been fun being here. Thanks.

Episode: 4
Title: Let's get you there safely
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Cam Haygarth

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christineaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the show, Cam. I'm so excited that you decided to be a guest for me. You and I have worked together for years now, actually, at different organizations. And one of the of reasons that I thought you would make a fantastic guest is that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you over the years. You are one of the most collaborative, just easy to get along with people that I've ever worked with. And I've always seen that in your leadership. So I really admire you and I couldn't help but be excited to invite you on the show. Welcome.

Cam Haygarth:
Thank you so much, Christine. Happy to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
And just really quick, as we get started, tell people your official title and role today.

Cam Haygarth:
Sure. Today I'm Vice President Marketing and Sales for SureShot Solutions. And if you want to know what SureShot solutions are, that's when you and go order a double-double, where the equipment that accurately dispenses whether it be the cream or the sugar, or the sweetener, or the milk. So that's what we do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Home of the double-double. So few people know that. SureShot's the one that makes that happen.

Christine Laperriere:
So then I'm going to dive right in and I'm going to ask you. I'm so curious, given how I've seen you lead, who comes to mind when I talk of who might be your best boss ever?

Cam Haygarth:
I've been fortunate to say I think I've had three best bosses ever, Christine. And I think I've been around long enough. I've been working for over 30 years now, hard to believe, but you really, really appreciate the good ones because they're, unfortunately, not as common as the rest, if you will. And so I've been fortunate enough to this point in my career have had three fantastic best bosses ever.

Christine Laperriere:
Great. And then, can you share some stories and some insights that you've learned from watching them?

Cam Haygarth:
Sure. The first gentleman, in this case, was early in my career. So I went to business school at Western, graduated, joined Coca-Cola bottler and in Southwestern Ontario in Kitchener. After about a year, I got moved to Sarnia, promoted to Sarnia. The VP for our region, gentleman named Don Mitchell, older gentleman, certainly older at the time. I was early twenties, he was probably in his fifties. Wait a minute. I'm in my fifties now. That's not good. That's not good. He was one of the hiring. He made the final decision on my hire. So I'm potentially a little biased, but just his vision, his communication skills. And with all three of my best bosses ever, just a sincere concern for you as a person, not only as somebody that works on his or her team, but as a person in your development, in your wellbeing.

Cam Haygarth:
And just a little story. An aside, he called me one, I think it was a Thursday evening, and he said, "Cam, I'm supposed to go to the NHL All Star game this weekend in Philadelphia." this is back when we did these type of things, "And I can't go, I have a family commitment. I'd like you to go with my tickets." So got to go to the airport, fly to Philadelphia, go to all these VIP events. Back then, it was a big deal. This was 1993 in Philadelphia. The reason I'm telling you this story, Christine, is, his son had a minor car accident a few weeks before. And I'm in Sarnia. People know Sarnia is down by not far from Detroit Windsor, and I've got to go to Toronto to the airport. And I had a company car, Coca-Cola bottler company car. And he said, "Cam, it's calling for snow tomorrow. I want you to rent a bigger, safer car to drive to the airport in Toronto, just so that you get there for sure. And you get there safe."

Cam Haygarth:
And so that is just one of many examples of just the type of person he was. And in all three cases, Christine, these people, you want to work hard for them, you want to make them proud of you. You want to do whatever you can, whatever it's physically possible to help them win because they care so much about you. And it's sincere. It's not the politician sincere. It's real.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. It's so interesting to hear that, Cam, because that is one of the qualities I see in you. I really feel like you have always demonstrated that from the first time that I met you. When, again, you didn't know anything about me and you just took a genuine interest in, "Who is this person in front of me, can I genuinely get to know them?" And then just your natural attention on the wellbeing of the person first and then doing business second, which to your point has always made me really want to make sure that you're a happy customer when I'm working with you, just because that sincerity comes across, right? Do you think that you got that trait from seeing that behavior and then trying to mirror that?

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah, I believe. I don't know if I got it, but I certainly was able to hone something there by mirroring and kind of watching his style learning. He was the type of guy who could give somebody crap without raising his voice, without swearing, without being disrespectful. Just a couple well-placed comments, words, and the message was clear. And I like to think that I took some things from him, that I've been able to use through the remainder of my career to this point.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. And what about the second boss?

Cam Haygarth:
Second boss was Vince Tim [inaudible 00:06:44]. I worked my way up through the bottling system at Coke, and then had the opportunity to jump over to the company side. So there's the company who have all the money and do the market. And then there's the bottler who does all the delivering, all the heavy work and has all the debt. And I moved to the company side and got promoted to Vice President of Food Service and Hospitality business unit. And my boss was the president Vince Tim [inaudible 00:07:13]. And much of the later years on the bottling side was working for command and control-type leaders. And when times were tough, when things weren't going well, they got louder and yelled more, and demanded more, and pushed more, and threatened more. And I came to work for this gentleman, Vince Tim [inaudible 00:07:39].

Cam Haygarth:
And we were in some tough times, but just seeing how he reacted in tough times and did not lash out, but actually brought people together. And his style, his ability to create a vision, build strategy, execute against it, and his communication skills were incredible. And so I just learned a lot, and that's another consistent theme through all three leaders is, it's not when times are good when you see and you learn, it's when times are tough that you know the good ones really shine through.

Christine Laperriere:
That makes a lot of sense to me. And I mean, I can think of, we're in the middle of a pandemic right now, so there's lots of businesses, organizations all over the place that we're seeing what leaders are made of right now. We're in those tough times for a lot of businesses. So I'm just curious when you're talking about his reaction and tough times, can you just give us maybe even a descriptor or an example of when you specifically remember watching his reaction and being surprised?

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. I think we would get on calls that our executive team would get on a call with our leadership in Atlanta every once a month, generally. And Atlanta at that time, the leadership style was different. It's changed over the years, but it was a little more of that command and control. And so if our numbers weren't where they wanted them to be, there'd be a lot of drilling down, a lot of challenging, a lot of those type of things, and particularly how we're dealing. We were leading the bottler from a franchise or perspective. Those calls could get pretty dark and pretty rough on the members of the executive team here in Canada.

Cam Haygarth:
But Vince could have easily, many times turned to us, to me, as an example of food service, "Why aren't your numbers better?" But he wouldn't... Very often he'd take it himself and he'd push back very often. And very respectfully, again, always respectfully, but he wouldn't just assume things were the way they were and that things had to be that way. He would respectfully push back and challenge back. And just the way he did that, Christine, was new to me at the time. I've since learned that there's a whole world out there with leaders like him, but at the time it was so new to me, so refreshing and so liberating in many ways in terms of the way I thought and the way I led, to be honest.

Christine Laperriere:
So he really had your back, is the impression I'm getting.

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly. And intellectually, you have to perform, you have to drive the results, all those good things, but it wasn't an "Either or", it was, "Okay. When things aren't great, we'll work our way through this and work together on it." So it wasn't just throwing somebody overboard right when things started turning south.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. I think that is one of those things that's, again, kind of easy to say and harder to do as far as the instinct to blame, the instinct to hunt for the fault in another person, that trait shows up again when times are tough and people are under pressure. Someone who can stay calm and collected and, again, rally for their people and rally for the integrity of the work that's getting done. I can see how he would end up on your top-three list.

Cam Haygarth:
For sure.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. Then I'm of course curious to know, I want to hear about the third.

Cam Haygarth:
Well, the third one, you know well, he's my current president, David Macaulay, and you of course introduced me to David and the SureShot Organization several years ago now. And I think aspects of both gentlemen and David, both the first two people I spoke of, the caring understanding side, and this might be part of that Eastern culture down, based in Nova Scotia. But just that, wanting to make sure you're okay, wanting to make sure things are going well in your life, not just work, work, work. And then dealing in tough times, as you mentioned COVID. And our business being in the equipment world, when things slow down, first thing people stop buying is things that they can delay if possible. And equipment very much falls into that category, especially our equipment, which seems to go on forever and ever, which is hard when you're in sales.

Cam Haygarth:
But we hit a real wall back in March and things ground to a halt. And tough times, and fortunately we have a very strong balance sheet, but David is trying to drive results for the shareholders and the stakeholders and, "What do you do?" and, "How do you deal with it?" And he always was calm, cool, collected, was quite open with the organization in terms of communicating where we were, what we were doing and just explaining that things were uncertain, but here's what we are doing. Here's what we can do.

Cam Haygarth:
And always trying to balance the three things, the wellbeing of the business, the wellbeing of our people and the wellbeing of our customers. And trying, not just in the short term, but in the long term. And we did have to do some very difficult things. We had to eventually restructure to a certain degree, but we're now coming out the other end. And I think we're in a great place. And it's because of the leadership communication style and just the ability to relate with our team, with our entire organization on a personal level, very powerful.

Christine Laperriere:
And, just again, it speaks volumes to when you put your people first and you make that investment, like you said, balancing the business between the customers and the people. I think that trifecta right there really does describe... It comes across somehow. I mean, I can even think of my own example of working with David, where I suffered a concussion. And I reached out to him and said, "I can't work for you right now." Obviously I was doing lots of sales strategy work. And I said, "Unfortunately, I have to take...", I think it was 12 weeks off, because I suffered a major concussion while I was working for him. And it was so interesting because the first thing that he said was, "If you need us to pay your invoice, don't worry about it. Just go ahead and bill us." And he was more... Genuinely, his first response was to try to make sure that I had enough money to survive versus his concern.

Christine Laperriere:
In the back of my head, I was thinking, "Oh, they're probably going to end their engagement with me. Three months is going to go by and they're going to hire somebody else." And just that feeling of dread a little bit. But his first concern was making sure that I had some financial stability while I had just suffered this accident. So I will never forget that. When somebody does that, you don't ever forget it. It leaves a mark. That response was so much more powerful than some of the other ones that I received.

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. He just has that. David drives for results and he is detailed-driven, he's focused, but he has that wonderful human touch and that ability to see beyond just the numbers and beyond just the business and understand... People development is such a huge part of our strategy as well. And trying to bring people along, see them progress. And in instances like yours, that's where you just see his big heart, just the way he approaches life in general and people in our organization.

Christine Laperriere:
I always... It's so interesting when you say that because I've really come to this conclusion because I do so much work in the leadership space and I'm always talking about the business case. And everybody struggles with soft skills because they struggle to see you the direct link to the bottom line. So this is part of my passion for this topic right now, is trying to understand really what is the impact of a best boss. And I think of that example with David and all I can say is that when anytime that he needed something, again, if I could figure out how to go the extra mile, I would go the extra mile just because it felt like it would be reciprocated when I needed it.

Cam Haygarth:
That's bang on, Christine. Exactly. All three of these individuals, you want to make them proud, you want to do whatever you can to help them succeed in business, in life. Anything I could do for them business or personal I would do just because of the way they've treated me and treated people in the organization. And you know how much work is part of our life. Those are the type of people like your mother, your father, you want to make them proud and you want to do whatever you can for them. So, definitely.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And then just for compare and contrast, have you ever had a not best boss ever, someone who would not make the list? And maybe you don't have to call them out necessarily by name, but mostly the characteristics or traits that stand out as being the most polarizing for you, or the ones where you just said, "I got to get out of here as fast as I can."

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. Senior level back on the bottler side. Command and control with disrespect, I would say, or with a lack of respect. And the impact that had on people in the organization, on the team. And it would create, just as good, strong values and attributes can transcend and can permeate the entire organization, so can disrespect some of those negative elements, they can, especially when it's coming from a senior level, it can permeate the organization.

Cam Haygarth:
And I saw that and I saw how it damaged good people who had to eventually exit, and then how it turned some people with good potential almost to the dark side in terms of where they gravitated, how they responded and reacted. And, fortunately, again, in my career, I haven't had too much of that, but there's been enough, very, very different, just two different ends of the spectrum, for sure, in my opinion.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I mean, I just love that you're bringing that point up, and I think it's a really great spot to pull it to close, which is, in my impression, what I find is that people mirror each other. That is what culture is. And so culture is always this. Again, it's hard to describe how do you invest in the culture of a business because it's not a tangible thing, does it actually impact the bottom line? It's really hard to prove a lot of the times because it's so subtle, but when you say that, I mean, I think of you explaining your best bosses ever, and how much of that shows up in the way that you lead and you interact with people, and then meanwhile to your exact point.

Christine Laperriere:
And I've seen it too, the disrespectful behavior. It's catchy because people start to say, "Well, that's got to be what I need to do to get noticed around here." And imagine when you start to have an organization that fills up with disrespectful people who are in that control-and-command style of leadership. I mean, you're not having the response that you and I just had where we said, "We'll do triple back flips because we want to make you proud." That goes away. You're like, "I will do the minimum amount to just stay off of your radar."

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Even if you're a top performer, it's hard to bring your A-game to someone who could be disrespectful.

Cam Haygarth:
And they say winning drives culture, but often you can't win right away. And sometimes you have to take when the times are tough or the situation is such that you're going to lose a few games before you start winning. And it's how you treat each other in those tough times that really helps pull you out and take you to a better place in the future.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Cam Haygarth:
And that's what, in my mind, builds that culture.

Christine Laperriere:
And you teach other people exactly how to respond to a tough time by the way you lead.

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Well, thank you, Cam. This was fantastic. And I know for a fact that there are people listening that can resonate with your story, for sure.

Cam Haygarth:
Thanks so much for the opportunity, Christine. Appreciate it.

Episode: 5
Title: Always on my side
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Tonya Campbell

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Hello, Tanya. And thank you so much for joining me on the show. I'm so glad to have you here. Now, I'm just going to start by saying why I invited you into the show. So I am getting this opportunity to work with you on the advancement of women. It's a large initiative, and I just love the insight and wisdom that you have from so many years of working in different parts of the organization and moving your career. And some of the stories that you tell and some of the insights that you have, I just find so fascinating, and so inspiring. So I had to have you on the Best Boss Ever Show. So thank you so much for joining me.

Tonya Campbell:
Oh, thanks for having me, Christine. It's a real pleasure to be here today.

Christine Laperriere:
And just so everybody knows, can you do a quick introduction?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. A quick introduction. So my name is Tanya Campbell. I am a regional vice-president for mobile financial planning team within Scotiabank. And I've been with the bank for, coming on to 25 years. So lots of experiences with bosses, I think in that 25 years, probably over a dozen roles. So that's over a dozen bosses and probably lots to share.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Well, that's why I just want to dive in. So, again, of those dozen bosses you would've seen and learned so much. So when you think back about some of the ones that stand out as your best boss ever, who comes to mind and why?

Tonya Campbell:
So I would say there's a few of them and, without calling out names, the ones that really stand out for me share very, very common characteristics amongst them. And it's easy enough to just say, they trusted me, they gave me autonomy, they gave me some flexibility to do my job the way I needed to do it. I think the real issue is, you have to talk about specifically what those things mean, but I would say that the ones that come top of mind did offer me trust, flexibility, autonomy, and the trust was probably the number one at the very, very top of it all.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you were to describe for so many of us, what does trust look like in motion? When you're working for a boss and you know, that is there. Tell us exactly what does that look like?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to describe, but I would use the words or I would use the analogy they have my back, and you only really know what you have my back means when you experience it. And for me, I think the best way to describe specific example would be there was a time when I was running a project, very high stakes projects, my perspective anyways across the bank. And you always know, especially over time as you develop through your career, you know which ones are high stakes, you know when there's people who are talking or meeting about certain topics behind the scenes.

Tonya Campbell:
And when you have somebody who has your back, you know that when things aren't always going well, because let's face it, not everything goes perfect a hundred percent of the time or, conversely, it could be going perfectly fine, but you will always have stakeholders who view things differently.

Tonya Campbell:
And for me, it was always knowing, or it was knowing that when those differences of opinions or perspectives were happening, that my leader was 100% always on my side. So if things were being said or done that were making them feel like maybe perhaps the stakeholders or the person that's sharing the opinion, if it didn't really seem like it was coming off in my favor, I knew that they would use words like, let me check into that.

Tonya Campbell:
And it was not ever about siding with what was going on or feeding into that. And the reason I knew that was because that boss would come back to me and say, "Hey, what's going on?" And they would give me the opportunity to share my perspective first and then in a very safe way go, "Here's what was said. And let's talk through that."

Tonya Campbell:
And so, it always felt like they gave me the benefit of the doubt first before feeding into any sort of negative dialogue or what have you. And that's just one example, I can think of. I'm drawing on that experience as we talk about without giving away the project. But that very specific example, I knew because there was multiple times where there was things that appearances from other people that it didn't look like it was going so well, but that boss always came to me. And honestly the person I report to right now, I have that exact same feeling. It doesn't matter what the initiative is. I know that that person trusts me and I got to tell you the other part, the other tangible thing that comes from feeling trust is that you feel braver.

Tonya Campbell:
You feel more okay to take risks, you feel more okay to take control, to make decisions because you're not fearing any of the ramifications. And I know there were times when in my current role where perhaps I had to make a judgment call and wasn't exactly sure if it was the right judgment call, but because I felt safe and I felt trust, I made the decision and I knew that the call even if it was a bad call, that the discussion with a leader would have been okay, let's walk through that. Why did you make that decision? And that could have been a learning experience rather than a beat up experience. So that's a couple of experiences I've had.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the way that you point out when you work for a leader that trusts you, you feel braver. So what do you think feeling braver actually does for your development?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. I mean, you take risks and I think risk taking is what makes you grow and it's okay. When you're an environment of trust and that trust breeds risk, then you know that there is outcome that is bad if you take the risk and it's successful. Yay, because winning breeds winning or whatever phrase you want to use. Success breeds success, winning breeds winning. But when you're in a safe environment and you have trust, if you fail, you know that it's going to be seen as something that you're learning from and how you're going to do better next time. And so, it's a win-win outcome, whether it's a win or whether it's a fail.

Tonya Campbell:
And you know that when you're in that environment, I think that you can also know that when you're not in that environment, because if you're feeling constrained, if you're feeling like you can't make up decision, if you're feeling like, "Oh my God, I don't want to do that, because I'm going to get in trouble," then you're going to know in that with a great boss because you're not empowered. So the exact opposite is also true.

Christine Laperriere:
And I just going to bring this up because this is one of my passion topics, but what does it do for your stress level too? When you look at the difference between working for someone who says, "Don't worry about it, I've got your back to take risks," versus when you're working for someone and you don't have that safety or that security.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. It's the difference between thriving and surviving. And honestly, when I think about the rules that I've been in, where I'm thriving, it's because I've got trust in that environment. And surviving has been in situations where like, I need to outlive this person or this group where there is no trust and surviving is, I'm going to do just what I need to do today to get to tomorrow and get to the next day until I'm finding myself somewhere else. So it is literally the difference between thriving and surviving.

Tonya Campbell:
Christine, I have peers and people who come to me for advice all the time on navigating their career, where they should go, what they should do, how have I navigated it. And some of the things that I share with them, obviously like there's networking and relationship currently is a big topic you and I have discussed at length lately.

Tonya Campbell:
But I always say to them, when you are doing that, when you're going through that process, be very careful because people can want to go like, I would love to work in this area, I'd love to work in technology or I would love to work in distribution leadership, or I would love to work in customer experience. And you could, you very well could. But you need to actually go and find out about the leadership and the environment there. And really what I'm getting at is the level of trust is not, you do need to ... Obviously you're almost like, people think about, "Oh, I'm going to go, and I'm going to network with this leader. Because I want them to think about me for the next job."

Tonya Campbell:
I'm like, well, you might want to go there and think about whether you want them to be the leader for you at the next job. It is a two way street. And that reason I tell them is because you can love the work itself, what you're going to do. But if you don't love the boss, the person that you're reporting to and the people around you, which are often a function of the trust in that environment, then it doesn't work. You can let in, just as much as you can love the person and the colleagues and the environment around you. But if you hate the work, that's not going to work.

Tonya Campbell:
You need to find that balance of those two and that it really truly does come from, it starts with the boss, right? Because that is what creates that environment of trust. And so, I think there's some really cliche things about good bosses, which they provide trust. They empower, they give autonomy and all those good things. It's cliche for a reason, it's because it's true. Like when you get those things, you feel like you're in an environment where you can thrive and not survive.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. So one question I have for you while we're just closing this. So now that you're in a leadership position and you have people that are coming to you, when you think of autonomy, for example. So there's a high risk project and you could go ahead and say, "Hey, I'm going to let you run with it. I've got your back." But you know that there's personal consequence to you if they fail or they don't get it right. Or you might have to do it over, or you might have a lot of it could come down to you, people asking you, "Why didn't you manage this person, well?" How do you deal with that now that the roles are reversed.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. So then I guess that becomes the question of, well, how, like how do you become a good boss? How do you provide autonomy and authority? And it really boils down to communication because ultimately if I provide authority to somebody, but I haven't given them proper instruction, that's on me. I should be in trouble. If I'm the throat to choke and it fails, I should. But giving people authority and autonomy to do their job comes with, they have to have the right instruction. They have to know what the goal is. And so that has to come from me. So that is what is required of a good boss, is to start with providing the vision, the instruction, what you can, and can't do. Like you have to give them the guideposts of what they can work within.

Tonya Campbell:
And once they have that, then you let them go. That's how I look at it. And again, when I think back to those people who did that for me, who set the good example for me. They taught me what's my playground, what are the guardrails in which I can play in. And then I knew, okay, it's outside that. Well, I better seek guidance and authority because it's outside of those bounds. And so, yeah, it really boiled down to that, and communicating as often as possible.

Tonya Campbell:
So providing an open door policy so that if they're unsure, they can safely come and ask those questions and not feel like they're going to be admonished for it. So it's seeking to understand. So now that I'm not in the boss's shoes and I have a team under me, having their back is doing exactly what I just shared with you, which is when I hear something, I go, "Thanks very much for that information." And then I go to my direct report and I go, "Hey, what's going on?" Seek to understand first. We all know there's three sides to every story, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Tonya Campbell:
It's really listening before you speak, it's listening and asking a lot of questions to get a good, deep understanding, listening to hear the answer, and not listening so you can respond. So I try to do and model all those things because they were the things that were done for me and worked for me and allowed me to thrive in my career.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. And then I have to ask the question. We all know that we learn the most, sometimes from the worst boss we've ever had. And you don't have to name any names, but just when you think of those lessons, what did you learn from the people who weren't the best leaders or your favorite leaders?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, Christine, we did have a little bit of a preamble on this topic, and I think back to that, and the truth is, you can't have the good without the bad. How do you know what's good unless you also know what's bad and the bad also for those of you, those people who want to be good can take what happened in that situation and make themselves better, which makes you more good. So those experiences for me, when I think about those times, and obviously not naming any names, they were really, really hard experiences to have. And I've shared with you that analogy of the thriving versus surviving. So yeah, I did have a couple of times in my journey over the 25 years where I was surviving and not thriving.

Tonya Campbell:
And it was hard in that moment to think about it and, "Oh, what can I take away from this?" So no judgment, if you're in that moment or in that right now, and you can't take the good out of it, but I assure you when you get out on the other side, if you look back and you go, "What was it that was so painful?" For me, it was taking it and looking at it and saying, "I made make a commitment. I will never do that. I will never be that kind of a person, because I'm going to etch this in my memory, how awful that made me feel. And therefore I will not do that to somebody else."

Tonya Campbell:
And again, you talk about cliches, but the behaviors in those scenarios were almost the exact opposite of all of the things I just shared with you, which was, I didn't feel like I had trust. I felt like I didn't have autonomy. I had somebody who was over me constantly. Where's this? Where's that? Second request, third request, when maybe they didn't give you the instruction, which is what I just shared with you, which is key, right? I'm like, well, I didn't give it to you because you didn't tell me you needed it, right?

Tonya Campbell:
And so, it's lack of access, lack of clarity and the instruction it's blame. Blame is a big thing for me in that environment where there's a bad boss, I've got air quotes, this is an audio. But if you could see me I'm air quoting, the bad boss. There's often an environment of blame. And so you're constantly feeling like you've got this shield over protecting you from the blame, the finger being pointed at you.

Tonya Campbell:
So that's the opposite. But yeah, the beauty, if you can look at it afterwards is you can take that experience. If you're committed to being a good boss, you want to be a good boss in the future. You take that experience and you commit to not doing those things. And if you have no aspiration to be a good boss, because maybe you can go, let's be honest, not everybody aspires to leadership, but what you can learn from it is, what I went back to take us back to where we were earlier, which is knowing what to look out for when you are looking at changing positions in the future. Or it's, how do you sniff that out? How do you know when you're reverse interviewing for a boss? How do you know that that's the type they are? And my advice to people would be to ask about leadership style and more importantly, interview the people on the team, ask them how things are, right?

Christine Laperriere:
I'm smiling while you're telling this story. Because one of my famous moments in my career, I went to work for someone and prior to taking the job, I interviewed three different people that had worked for him. And every single one said, "Don't go work for him." And I said, "I get along with everyone." And then I proceeded to march off and go work for him and learned 18 months later that I don't get along with everyone. And I guess to your exact point, you go do your homework, but also to not be so naive that you do get ... Some of us walk in thinking, "Oh, but I'll be able to handle that. Well, I'll be able to handle that." But when you talk to three or four people and they all, don't feel like that person is the most empowering, just be prepared.

Tonya Campbell:
Yes. One red flag means talk to another person, two red flags. It's probably two red flags, and three is, definitely don't go there. But I would say, when do people not see the red flags? It's when they're desperate to get out of their situation that they're in right now. So that's if you're desperate because you're in the survival mode, you are more apt to make a mistake. And I would say that is when you need to be the most cautious and do the most due diligence. And on the flip side, I forgot all these juxtapositions, all these oppositions to each other.

Tonya Campbell:
The truth I think is also when you're in the thriving mode that I discuss or have shared with you. I think it's easier to find the thriving again, because it's like a snowball effect. Once you're in there, you just never really gravitate back towards them. So I think the truth could also be said about the bad boss situation, but I've seen people who've been able to navigate their way out and navigate their way back in by mistake out of desperation.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Any last tips for any leaders that are listening right now and they want to take something away, really tangible that they should implement next week?

Tonya Campbell:
No, I think that, for me, it's understanding your own style of leadership, and I think I've done some homework on leadership, I've read books and stuff. And if I were to describe my style and the styles that have really worked for me and for many people around me is, it's a servant style leadership. And I think if you're a leader, who's trying to figure that out and understand what they want to be. If you want to be the one that provides trust, who provides lots of instruction and gives people autonomy. If that sounds like the type of boss you want to be, then you have to understand what servant and style leadership is.

Tonya Campbell:
And that is that you work for those people, not that they work for you. And if you adopt that mindset, like I'm here to serve you. I'm here to make your job easier. I'm here to empower you. It means you're serving them. And so that's my view. It's not necessarily everybody's view and certainly other leadership styles work, but it's been my experience that when you look at it from that perspective, you see your employees differently, you see them as wanting to ... You truly, you genuinely want to understand. It's like I'm not doing this because the book said I should do it. I'm doing it because I serve these people.

Tonya Campbell:
And it really does for me, like when I understood that about myself, that that's what brings me joy in the work that I do. It completely changed everything for me. And it was a long time thing. It's not like I woke up one day and said, "Oh, this is what I am." It's just the old time I learned that. And so the advice I would give to people is, figure it out. Like what, what type of leader do you want to be? And if you haven't done the reflection, like what you and I have talked about today, Christine, which is, who were the best bosses? Who were the worst bosses. If you have, that's the very next step it would be, if you've not done that. Do it, and then figure out which pieces of the puzzle you're going to bring forward in your life and make a conscious effort to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.

Tonya Campbell:
My advice in a nutshell.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. Thank you so much, Tanya. I know people are going to get a lot of value out of this, so thank you so much for coming on the show today.

Tonya Campbell:
Absolute pleasure. Thanks so much, Christine.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast


Episode: 6
Title: Recognizing greatness in others
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Sarah McVanel

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
So today I'm here with Sarah and I am going to let her introduce herself. But let me just tell you why I picked Sarah. So I really find Sarah's background amazing. She had a career in healthcare, life handed her a bit of a surprise, and all of a sudden she had to make a leap and transition into something that she could be her own best boss ever. What I thought was so cool, is she...

Sarah McVanel:
Yeah, exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
And you picked a topic of... I'll let everybody hear it from you, but you picked a topic that I think is so crucial to actually helping leaders become a Best Boss Ever as your passion and the focus of your business. So it just seemed like Sarah had to be on the show. So Sarah, thank you so much, and welcome.

Sarah McVanel:
Thanks for having me, Christine. I'm so glad you here.

Christine Laperriere:
Just tell Everybody really quick the name of your business, and just a little bit about yourself.

Sarah McVanel:
So my business is Greatness Magnified, and I'm Canada's recognition expert because what we consistently found in any team consultation, even if it was from an abundant place, the easiest way to gain collaboration, and build trust and momentum was through recognition. We tried all kinds of other things that would help too out of our deep toolkit in organizational development, and the one thing that always worked. And to your point around Best Boss Ever, why does it work for teams?

Sarah McVanel:
Because that's what makes people give their discretionary effort and make them want to do their best. And so not surprisingly, it's also what makes leaders great bosses. That's what I get a chance to do. I get to work with great bosses, great organizations through the exponential power of recognition.

Christine Laperriere:
That is amazing. And I know for me personally, recognition always was a big amplifier for sure during my corporate days. So start by telling us a little bit. When I asked you the question, who's your best boss ever, tell me who came to mind and why?

Sarah McVanel:
Well, I'm lucky that I had to really sift through a number of people. Aren't we all lucky to have many options. The one that really stands out in my mind is Louis Taylor Green, the current head of the Human Resource Professional Association of Ontario. And what made her my top choice was that when I had to share with her some pretty tricky notes.

Sarah McVanel:
So here she had lost her director of organizational development, so now she's got all of me and my colleagues, individual contributors reporting to her, she's a senior executive, she doesn't have time to meet one on one with us. But every week she made the time because she wanted to support us wholeheartedly to continue to do the great work we were doing. And also, because the organization so needed us in this massive of time of transformation.

Sarah McVanel:
And in one of those meetings, I had to tell her a local organization, another healthcare hospital, has asked me to come and start up the organizational development department, and I kept saying no, and they kept asking me. And I went for an interview and I've got the job, and it just seems like such a great opportunity. And I expected her to be so angry with me. This was a terrible time to leave.

Sarah McVanel:
And what she did was she pushed all of her papers aside, the list of things that we needed to talk about and the files that her and I had both brought to the table. And she said, "Okay, if you give me four weeks, the next four conversations we're going to have is about you and your next phase of your career." She just said, "I'll trust that you're going to hand over the projects. We don't need to talk about it anymore." And that's what she did.

Sarah McVanel:
She mentored me in having the Best Boss transition. That's what I'm calling it now. So for example, she helped me discern how to create a value proposition process. So when I started the organization, I initiated the first blush of people's experience of organizational development, was one of collaboration and support versus them resisting it, or me having to prove myself. She said, "Just believe that you're already there, and partnering with them and to serve them. So what would that look like?

Sarah McVanel:
And we co-created much with her guidance, the most amazing new way to not just start a department, but to start any job. And I have to tell you, I have led and mentored so many people in that process, all the down to Louise's supporting guidance.

Christine Laperriere:
So she's basically mentored you into a job with a different organization?

Sarah McVanel:
When it completely blindsided her. I had been in that organization for one year. It was too soon to leave, it was a bad time to leave. She was probably so busy. She had small children at home still, and she just realized my job is to support this person across from me.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. I find that amazing because one of the themes that's showing up as I'm sitting down and interviewing people about their best boss, is this commitment to the person in front of them, above and beyond their commitment to the business. I bet a lot of CEOs would be very scared to hear that. "Oh, by the way, these bosses, the reasons they're the best bosses is because they're committed to the person over the business." Actually the business.

Christine Laperriere:
But it's so fascinating because again, the impression that leaves on you and the way that you would reflect on that experience, that'd be a game changer.

Sarah McVanel:
Well, imagine how many people I now have the privilege as a professional speaker to tell about her. So a great example of that, because I speak for a lot of human resources groups and there's chapters across Ontario, we've got 22,000 HR professionals in Ontario alone, and it's obviously a designated profession. So to have that term, you need to get your CCEs. So as I'm going from chapter to chapter, especially when Louise was... It was announced that she was coming into this role, I said, "You are going to love what she's going to do. I know she's not in the role yet, but let me tell you."

Sarah McVanel:
And I not only would tell the board that, I would stand in front of the people there, whether it was 30 people or 300 people in the room, "Everybody, you wait until she starts. She is..." And I would use my version of the story of the Best Boss Ever. And then they all got excited because here's the head of the most important association of your career who has already demonstrated she is for the 'people'. So now she doesn't have to just be for the one person in that meeting, she just gets to be the person for 22,000 people in Ontario. They got pretty pumped.

Christine Laperriere:
Another thing that I have noticed in some of the trends of some of these discussions is again, the followership or the way that these things come back later in your career. I'm sure she wasn't thinking about what the return on investment was going to be as she gave you those four hours and she mentored you in that new role, but that again has been an amplifier for her because if she's done that for a number of people who have worked with her, what are they saying behind her back?

Christine Laperriere:
Free branding you've done for her just because you couldn't help it. That's genuinely how you feel. So it took no effort to say, "Oh, let me tell you about what an amazing leader she is." So I think that is an incredible story, and I think it's just such a good example of the selflessness that shows up in some of those best bosses that we hear about.

Sarah McVanel:
And you can't fake that. It didn't even take longer than half a second for her to push those papers aside. To your point around it amplifies and it becomes this reciprocal process, because she didn't think twice to support me. And again, that it wasn't from a self serving place. It wasn't, "Okay, well, how do I make myself look good? Or now I can put this on my resume that I mentor an X number of people." It's who she is.

Sarah McVanel:
And I think that's probably why she has taken this role as the head of our association, because she probably could make a lot more money working in the very senior roles that she's been in for the majority of her career. So Best Bosses Ever in my experience, as I say, I'm lucky to have many, they do things because it's the right thing to do. And by doing the right thing to do, people respect you, they talk about you, they want to do well by you. I'm sure because I've at times been the best boss ever. I've also been the worst boss ever.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, me too.

Sarah McVanel:
The whole effect of... But I model myself. I try to model... Including now when I have folks who work in my private business. You try to aspire to be like them. They are your muse of who you... Because you have actually a model. A frame of reference to use. And so your Best Bosses Ever, they stay alive. We remember, as you know from your neuroscience work, it's the neurolinguistic processing, all of that great juicy, yummy stuff that you do [inaudible 00:10:04] hard wire, really strong emotions. Best Bosses Ever, just like the worst bosses ever, they imprint themselves on our consciousness.

Sarah McVanel:
We pull them up, or the feelings that they had, that they created in us in micro moments, in longer term relationships, because it's such an emotionally laden experience. So anyone who's listening here, I would say what kind of emotional imprint are you making with the people who report to you, and frankly, that report with you. Because you never know. They could be your boss, you could be their boss one day.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. Things change quickly. I know that for sure. And you're right. I think that's actually one of the benefits that I'm really trying to drive with the work that I do with so many leaders, is that when you've worked for a Best Boss Ever, it's catchy. It's like we can't help ourselves, but mirror what we see in those Best Bosses Ever. And so I kind of feel like in my work, the bar is low often. We're just trying to make sure leaders aren't disruptive and that they don't have a lot of turnover, and we're just trying to basically help them meet the minimum bar of not being a worst boss.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's why I really came up with the name for the show, Best Boss Ever. Is how do we set the bar back up here again? Because I think the impact of those Best Bosses Ever is a giant multiplier. This isn't just about people feeling like they can come to work every day and they know what to get done. This is about people feeling like they would go the extra mile. They would walk on broken glass for that leader because that's how much they feel passionately. So that's your point about imprinting emotion. Is that they feel like I would do whatever it takes. [crosstalk 00:11:52].

Sarah McVanel:
For my whole career, that that person is... It's not a moment in time anymore. This person is part of your career legacy. And that's where recognition, it's such an easy thing to feel passionate about, and for me to have dedicated my speaking career, and sometimes working with some of those Best Bosses Ever to rebuild programs that authentically align to their leadership, their organization's desire to not just get through.

Sarah McVanel:
And as you and I both know that unfortunate statistic, that only 30% of north Americans are truly satisfied at work. So that's telling me in the context of our conversation, how many people are aspiring to be the Best Boss Ever. And perhaps more importantly, how many organizations are aspiring to enable people to be the Best Boss Ever. Because it's not bosses generally unless there's some really significant, bigger issue at play.

Sarah McVanel:
People want to do well. They want to get up and go to work, whether it's virtual and it's with your elastic pants on, or in your Armani suit at work, whatever that looks like. Bosses want to get up and do great work. They want to get their work done and feel a sense of accomplishment. They want to facilitate others to do meaningful work. They want to know notice greatness.

Sarah McVanel:
Unfortunately, a lot of great bosses work in not so great systems with too much work to do, and we owe it to great bosses to enable them to be that way. And when nothing else enables that to happen, what I tell those great bosses who want to do great work but they're greatly overwhelmed, forever recognize that there's greatness. Notice the small, seemingly invisible or microscopic examples of what's working well, things to acknowledge. That will give you the hope and the fuel, and the food for continuing in systems that are often not set up for people to lead and become the Best Boss Ever.

Christine Laperriere:
You're making me think of one of my experiences when I led a large team. I had one guy on my team, he was brand new, he was as green as green could be, but he would get up in the morning and be at the plant at 5:00 in the morning, and really was saying to the client, "We're here, we're serious. We're not just going to show up when it's convenient. We're going to show up when you're in business and you're doing the operation.

Christine Laperriere:
And so him being there at 5:00 in the morning and representing us was so important. He had had these incredibly long days, and I remember he was off to LA to go visit some family on a Thursday, and I said, "Hey, you know what? Why don't you catch the early flight and go? You've been working around the clock. Get there early enough that you can go have dinner with some sunshine." It's California. It was in the middle of the winter. And oh my goodness, did I take a giant lashing from my boss.?

Christine Laperriere:
So when my boss showed up that day, he said, "Where is this gentleman?" And I said I let him leave early, because he's been in at 5:00 and he's been doing great... He's new, so there's still a lot of things that he is trying to get up to speed on, but he's really been bringing his best self on tough hours. On hours that I can't even keep up with." And oh my goodness, did I ever get beat up over that one? And it really sent a message to me.

Christine Laperriere:
But when you made the comment about enabling people to be Best Boss Ever material, it just dawned on me, I haven't thought about that element of it and how I think for me, that was one of the most frustrating parts of being a leader, was that I felt like I was in an organization where they were more worried about me being too kind than... They were almost worried that somehow I was going to be so soft that all the results were going to fly out the window.

Christine Laperriere:
Meanwhile, my argument was exactly the opposite, where I was like, "Why don't you just let me do it my way, and let's prove it?" Because all I know is I was nominated for manager of the year, by the people who worked for me. "So let me prove it, and let me show you whether or not it works." But people were so scared that the results were going to drop on my team because I was doing things as thank yous. Non monetary things.

Sarah McVanel:
Love it. That's number one way people want it.

Sarah McVanel:
Well, right. Because they didn't hand me a bag of money to give out as gifts, and so I was always trying to come up with clever ways, and a lot of the times it might be a special occasion or some way that somebody could spend that extra evening with their family so that they could come back on Monday and feel like, "Hey, my boss gave me a little extra here this week, I'm going to give a little extra this week," and to create that trade. Anyway, I just think that is such an excellent point about enabling leaders to be a Best Boss Ever, and how important that is to the equation of actually being one.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you for sharing that story, and I'm so glad that you're the type of individual type of human that's willing to risk being raked over the coals by your boss to do the right thing. And I know I've even had that experience with peers in my last senior leadership role. If we had an issue at senior team on Tuesday that we didn't know how to fix, because frankly, most of the time you don't. If it was that easy to fix, it probably wouldn't make it to senior team and it wouldn't be something we have to revisit the next week.

Christine Laperriere:
So every Friday I had the whole day blocked, and I'd spend part or all of it shadowing somebody at the front line who knew more about this situation because they were living it every day. So we had beds backed up in the ER, or we had an infection outbreak on one unit but not the parallel unit, or we're having an increase in number of complaints of a particular area. I'd go and I would spend time in whatever they wore, tennis shoes and scrubs, or my normal clothes if that's what needed it.

Christine Laperriere:
And people would tell me stuff. People didn't initially feel like I was there to help and understand and serve. They initially were suspicious. So what does that say about us as leaders? I don't just mean in that organization, because I think that that would happen across many organizations if not almost all, is people would be suspicious. "Why is the boss showing up?" But what I found is, I could get over that suspicion pretty quickly and word gets around.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, she's poking her nose in on Fridays. It's just because she's learning something and she's curious and she wants to help. Here's the other thing though. Christine, I don't know if you've heard this, my peers didn't like it. I could get over the not liking it initially from the staff, because if banning only the holdouts for the people would be negative anyway. It was my peers who didn't want me to 'make them look bad.' And I'd say, "Well go and shadow them." And we're all busy.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm not trying to minimize, they're doing the best they can. They're leading the way they felt they needed to lead. However, if you want to be the Best Boss Ever, it often takes courage to be different, and to say, "I don't think we're leading in the best way. I don't think that this is helping. I don't know if our customers are happy with us."

Christine Laperriere:
So you have to be sometimes willing to be the worst colleague ever. Report ever the worst advocate ever, or the best advocate ever to be seen as the worst collaborator ever. Because it's not a nice, tight, discrete parts. It's not like, "Oh, if I become the best boss ever, that equates to the best..." Fill in the blank.

Christine Laperriere:
No, it's controversial. And that's why I actually love this topic because it isn't black and white. Just like you said, being a best boss can get you in trouble in different parts. Like you said, when you're really hunting for truth, sometimes that can cause trouble in other camps. So sometimes it's really how are you able to navigate so many different variables at the same time? So anything come to mind when you think of your worst boss ever?

Sarah McVanel:
Oh yes, absolutely. Ironically, it's the person that I reverted to and my husband reports to. We met in the restaurant industry, and he was managing a restaurant by the worst human ever; not just boss. This person would rival insert who you think is the worst human ever, he's beside that person. She just happens to be less famous. So you think your worst human ever, she's up wherever they go after you leave this earth, she's hanging out with them and having a really awful dinner.

Sarah McVanel:
And so Mark and I talk about her still at the dinner table, and we use this as an education with our kids about you do not need to be treated badly or work in an unsafe environment. So here's the worst, worst boss ever. So she initially hires people based on their looks, first of all, so discriminatory. So I guess I got enough of a pass that I made it through the door.

Christine Laperriere:
That's how you met your handsome husband, right?

Sarah McVanel:
That's how I met my handsome husband. Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
I was just going to say not so bad after all.

Sarah McVanel:
Okay. So maybe I shouldn't use her as an example. You never knew. She was one of those folks you never knew what you're going to get. Occasionally she would be sweet as sticky syrup and you were like, "Oh gosh, what happened?" And you tippy toe around. More often if she came by, it was like a thunder cloud. And she was this tiny, probably half my size. If the wind blew, she'd blow over. Just this tiny, tiny lady.

Sarah McVanel:
But her volatile emotions and presence was enough to scare even the customers. And why? So nobody complained. She could control everybody underneath her thumb, and she worked all the time. She was a very unhappy person, and we all knew that that's why she was the way she was. But she made people climb up. If the gutters were blocked, she'd say go climb up that raggedy ladder, and you could fall off. If the cooler was not working properly in the fridge and the food got mold on it, she'd say scrape it off and serve it anyway.

Sarah McVanel:
Firstly always was dirty because she had to buy the cheapest parsley ever, and we had to 'conserve water' so it didn't get washed properly. And I would have to... [crosstalk 00:22:59]. Yes. I would have to go and feed it to the people. She didn't always get the linen properly washed. I was just gross. It was gross, and so was so cruel. She would [crosstalk 00:23:13] feel like the smallest person ever. And if a customer complained, because we worked in [inaudible 00:23:19] lake, so you often wouldn't see these people back and this was pre Yelp days, she didn't care if she dressed you down.

Sarah McVanel:
If you complain, Christine, she'd say, "You know what? You're the little tiny woman and I don't need to deal with this. I run this big, successful restaurant. I don't care what you think." She'd actually insult you to your face in front of your [crosstalk 00:23:39].

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Sarah McVanel:
And people would have their jaws sitting on the sticky table.

Christine Laperriere:
After eating their dirty parsley.

Sarah McVanel:
Their dirty parsley, they're moldy buns. It was terrible.

Christine Laperriere:
That is unbelievable, and creates, I bet, a very rich conversation around dinner. I don't know if I'd lose my appetite talking about that too much. [crosstalk 00:24:08]. That's right. That's exactly right. It could be much worse, kids, if you don't like this.

Sarah McVanel:
It could be much worse. There's nothing moldy here. Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
But it's just interesting. So I have two questions about that, and the first is, people don't treat people like that unless there's... We already know hurt people hurt people is the way it works. Any guesstimate as to where some of that toxicity really, at the end of the day, came from?

Sarah McVanel:
Well, I probably have greater insight because my husband did work as her right hand, and he never put up with her nonsense, which is, I think, the only reason why he was able to do that. So he had a bigger window. Her husband, unfortunately he had an addiction to alcohol and he was a player, and would constantly cheat on her and she put up with that. Twitched his or her own, if that's fine for you, that's fine... [crosstalk 00:25:01].

Christine Laperriere:
Awful marriage at home.

Sarah McVanel:
Unfortunately, I think in her case though, she just felt she had to find another outlet. He made her feel terrible, and he ignored her and he was often away, so she then... It was actually correlated. The more he would behave in a certain way, she would behave in a certain way. The other thing was she had three children and all of them hated her. So that also was an indication that there's something not great with relationships and the way you are with people.

Sarah McVanel:
So the chicken or the egg, is that their behavior or their detesting of their mom creates her to be not nice to us, or did something have to happen to create all three children being... And they don't talk. They didn't go to her funeral, they never were by the bedside when she had a stroke.

Christine Laperriere:
That's awful. I think that there was a very unhappy family dynamic by the time I joined the organization, and that's unfortunately sometimes the case, I don't know how often.

Sarah McVanel:
Well, again, it just speaks to some of the things when you start thinking about what enables a best boss ever. When we look at what's happening at home, it definitely pours through into how we lead, and lots of leaders will tell you when they are unhappy, how hard it is. This definitely sounds like a much more amplified case, but it's just interesting because many of us, and I know myself included, when things aren't great at home, that frustration still shows up everywhere else too.

Sarah McVanel:
I've had a great boss who shared with me some lessons learned from stories and situations, so maybe the part B to that, which I so appreciate your reflection, is who chooses to take those challenging experiences and use those as lessons to more junior folks to elevate them to learn like, "This is what I went through. Maybe you can learn from that." As opposed to it become you now get to be victimized by my sense of injustice or unhappiness in the world. We don't all come out of this world unscarred or with life being a fairytale. So how do you choose use your message your message?

Sarah McVanel:
Do you make it extra messy, or do you help other people to leverage or to work through challenging times?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Excellent. Well, this has been absolutely lovely talking to you today. I'm just smiling because I had a few Aha moments myself, so I've written them down and I'll be thinking about them as I reflect on our call. It was great to hear your story about Louise, and again, I really appreciate the work you're doing around recognition, and how you're helping leaders build that into their practice, because again, I think we'll have more Best Boss Ever candidates if we can find more people who are willing to build strong recognition skills. So thank you Sarah so much. [crosstalk 00:28:11].

Sarah McVanel:
The easiest way. Yeah, my pleasure. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you. Have a good one. Take care. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com, and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Title: Keep calm and carry on
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Steve Robert

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So Steve, welcome to the show. And just as we're getting started, I have to explain why I'm so excited to have you specifically on the show. So we've had the opportunity to work together for over 10 years. I was thinking about it just this morning going, "Wow, it's been that long." And we've also had the chance to work on big account strategies together, looking at how do we transform sales organizations. So we've really gotten a chance to get into the weeds of a lot of work over the last 10 years. And so it just seemed like, I know that we've already had this conversation about what those best bosses look like and how do we bring some of that spirit to the work world. So it just seemed like you'd be the perfect guest for this show. So thank you so much for coming out.

Steve Robert:
Thanks so much for having me Christine. And, yeah, we've been working together for a long time, so appreciate that. And really looking forward to doing this and having this conversation.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm just going to dive in because you know, I don't waste any time. So I can't wait to hear, tell me about your best boss ever.

Steve Robert:
Sure. Best boss ever was back, I'm going to say well over 10 years ago, when I worked with a food equipment manufacturer. This person just really did a phenomenal job in kind of shaping the future of my career path. And he did it in many different ways, but I would say the biggest thing for me was his ability to listen and engage. And those things for me were really powerful because he would be able to listen to a situation that I had encountered which at the time I felt was catastrophic, if you will. And really just getting emotional into the moment. And he was just so phenomenal at boiling things down, calming it down, distilling what the issues were and trying to work with me to find a solution. And that was incredibly powerful.

Steve Robert:
He did it with me, but he also did it with the other folks that reported directly into him. And I think that really helped to shape the future. From my perspective, it really opened my eyes as to what being a real leader is. And I've never forgotten it because I've also experienced the other side where you have a boss that doesn't listen so well. I definitely draw on the positives from my best boss ever.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. I think that's such a good example, where you're talking about you're getting emotional, you're getting fired up. And one thing I know in my own experience I get, especially earlier in my career, very emotional, very fired up about different topics and different issues, which is really just a sign of high employee engagement. But with the wrong boss, they deflate that, right. They almost crush your employee engagement because you care so much. But this one sounds like he was able to do quite the opposite. Like he was still able to leverage that engagement, but just redirect the energy.

Steve Robert:
Yes, very much so. And I think the one thing that he made me aware of is self-awareness. Having emotional intelligence to kind of look at a situation holistically versus just in that particular moment. And the biggest thing for me is if you hit the challenge or hit a wall, it doesn't mean that you stop there. You just got to find a way around or over the wall to get to that end game. I think those are the of positive draws. On the other side, you're right. If you don't have your best boss ever, and you're confronted with situations, gosh, you hate to feel badly about making a mistake because at the end of the day I think making a mistake is an opportunity to learn and draw from that. It's experience.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Steve Robert:
And we all have experience which means we've all experienced failure.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely. Can you tell me a little bit about, give me just the nature of what that conversation looks like when your best boss ever is talking to you and you're really riled up about an issue. Just give me a little bit more detail. What is that conversation really look like?

Steve Robert:
Sure. I mean, I can think of a very good example where we had an account where it just meant a lot to us from a revenue perspective, things were not going well and it wasn't a result of our engagement, but as a result of some failures in terms of the equipment that we were providing this particular customer with. And I'll tell you, if you're leading sales and you're faced with this consequence of your biggest account threatening to leave, I was hot. And it was very simple, he just stayed so calm and said, "Okay, let's whiteboard this situation." And he took this very calm approach and current situation and drew out the path to the best possible outcome.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. That's awesome. Okay. So whiteboard, I'm making a note here because I love a whiteboard.

Steve Robert:
I do too. It's my friend. It's my friend.

Christine Laperriere:
I know. I've had quite many jokes about my obsessions with whiteboards. But that's brilliant. So he stayed very calm while you were extremely riled up and upset about the potential of losing this account. And then it sounds like the whiteboard gave him an opportunity to start to draw out what was in your head, what your concerns were, right?

Steve Robert:
It was exactly like that. But more importantly, it was for me to also gain some clarity from the whiteboard exercise. I was beginning to see that it wasn't as catastrophic as I thought, there was a way to fix it. Obviously no one wants to hear that your largest customer's upset and they're threatening to potentially leave you as a customer, no one wants that. But that whiteboard exercise, while it was important for him to draw out the facts, it was really therapeutic for me to see that there was a very clear path to overcome this. In the moment I didn't see it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Steve Robert:
And that's one of the great things that I learned from him. And I've really taken that to the next level as my career has moved on.

Christine Laperriere:
That is excellent. And that is such a good story, because again, I always say, it's how do we put it into motion? It's not just we need trust or we need good listening skills. Like, this is exactly how he listened. This is the tactical nature of how he listened. But also how he, I think he protected your engagement in the situation, which I think is important. Because just to say, "Hey Steve, just calm down, this isn't a big deal." He could have easily just said, "This isn't that big a deal. You're just riled up right now. Just calm down." But instead he didn't, he honored where you were at. And then he said, "Okay, let's work together so I can show you some clarity to where we're going"

Steve Robert:
That's exactly what he did. And as I said earlier, he did it for everyone he interacted with. And that's the powerful piece because he created a really dynamic and engaged team that was working in lockstep with one another. So there weren't any silos. And that was really important because as a leadership team, you're able to filter down or advocate team synergy. And team doesn't mean just your department. It means the entire company. It was incredibly important, a great lesson, because I've seen the alternative where it's not so great.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You know, I think you bring up a really interesting point about the consistency of treating everyone the same way. Because it could have been easy for him to go "Oh, well here I have this very dynamic, very ambitious salesperson. I'm going to spend time nurturing them, but the rest of my team, maybe they're not worth the time." I've seen that a lot. Right?

Steve Robert:
Sure, sure. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Where we choose to be the best boss ever for our favorites and then save that energy from the rest and I'm hearing that that was not the case.

Steve Robert:
Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I mean, when you really kind of stop and think about this best boss ever concept, I can't even put a price tag on that as I evaluate. As I got prepared for this thinking about best boss ever versus alternatives, and there's just a clear difference in working for that best boss ever. I've learned from those experiences. And the big thing that I drew on this is the self-awareness piece and really striving to continuously learn from each experience because we're going to continually grow and run into new experiences. And it's being able to stop and reevaluate and really be self aware of how you dealt with the situation, how it could have been dealt with differently.

Christine Laperriere:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excellent. So do you have any stories, it doesn't have to be related to this one, but one where you worked for a leader and it was, we can gossip a little bit about maybe arguably, maybe a worse boss or maybe, in your world, not a favorite. Like a specific story or something that comes to mind when I think of those.

Steve Robert:
Yeah, for sure. I can definitely think of one and I think it's all the opposite of everything I talked about. It's disengaged. It's doing exactly, as you said, not really listening to the situations like it's not that bag go figure it out, that type of approach. Because you don't really need help at this level, you're our leader, you don't need help. And that type of mindset can really kind of diminish, I would say, team synergy, team productivity that alignment within the organization. And for me, it is just such a clear difference. Really makes it challenging to really kind of get your team focused on driving those results. When, gosh, you're not really working together at the top to cultivate this spirit of overcoming challenges.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. So when you see the silos in motion and you can't bring them down because the leaders aren't talking to each other. Right?

Steve Robert:
Very, very difficult. Very frustrating. And I think you hit on a very key point, it does create disengagement. As I thought about this last night, getting ready for this morning, I was like, "Wow." I remember feeling tired and unproductive and drained from that experience because I did care. And I did want to do really, really well for my team, for myself, for the organization. And I really kind of refer to that experience as a boss that was a diminisher if you will, a diminisher of what you're trying to accomplish.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. As soon as you say that, I think of leaders that I worked for, especially early in my career and I was so passionate and so committed to making that business the best business it could be. And it was just so interesting how many leaders were just like, "Oh, calm down, don't work so hard. You're taking this almost a little too seriously."

Steve Robert:
Yeah. And there's nothing worse than that when you really care. That's a terrible, terrible feeling when you really care and you hear that message. It's tough. It's tough.

Christine Laperriere:
So, okay. So just to summarize, if you were to offer a piece of advice for anybody that's listening right now, and they are truly committed to trying to be a best boss, what would you tell them? Like give them really tactical tips on what you would tell them to do next.

Steve Robert:
Yeah. First thing is, reflect. So what were your experiences? So let's really reflect on who your best boss was or is versus the alternatives that we just covered and really draw on that. And I think the second one is really be self aware of how you engage in situations. Because I think that's really important is being able to walk away from different situations and evaluate how you handled it. Did you do the best that you could? Especially if you're getting feedback that basically draws out opportunities for improvement, think about those things and really, really focus on them. That self-awareness piece, you can't put a price tag on that. And the third thing I'd say is solicit the feedback. I think it's really important that you encourage the feedback to come from team members, so same level, but also the people that report into you. That's really important to give them the confidence to want to speak up to you. Because that in itself is priceless. If you can create an environment where people feel comfortable to give you the straight good feedback, you will be by far a much better leader for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. I think even given that too, I have to add in here, I really love your story about your best boss, who took a very calm approach when you were upset, but also did not deflect your emotion. Like I think there's something really emotionally intelligent about that response to an employee who's highly engaged, but is truly concerned at a very deep level and comes into the room and says "The sky is falling. The sky is falling." And without undermining your experience, he was able to stay rooted, walk you through the experience, teach you something really important about the experience, but never disengaging you or telling you that you shouldn't think or feel the way you did.

Steve Robert:
I totally agree. And just sitting here talking about this brings a smile to my face, because I work so hard trying to get to that place where I can be as calm and collected as he is and still is today. And again, that self-awareness journey is critically important. We got to learn from each situation. But it is unbelievable just thinking about how great he is at engaging with people and helping to overcome issues and the way he does it. His disposition just being so genuinely calm and really wanting to help you fix something. It's fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. What a great show. Thank you very much for those nuggets of wisdom. I'm smiling because I'm thinking already about where I can apply some of the things that you just talked about today. So I really enjoyed this chat, Steve, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Steve Robert:
Thanks Christine. It's always a pleasure.

Christine Laperriere:
All right. Have a good one. Take care.

Steve Robert:
Okay, you too.

Title: The value of "I don't know"
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Eric Wasser

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
Eric, thank you so much for coming on the show. I am going to start by sharing why I invited you on the show and I have had the opportunity to work with you at our days at Miller Heiman. Wow. Back 2008, I think, might have been the start of that for me anyway. So it was lovely because I just remember one of the things that I saw in you was just an incredible passion for people, passion for leadership and passion for sales. You just ooze that anytime that I've been around you and just a real commitment to paying attention and engaging with the people around you. So I feel like you would be a great person to interview on the Best Boss Ever show, so thank you.

Eric Wasser:
Well, thanks for having me and I could mirror all that back to you as to how excited I was to accept the invitation. So awesome to be able to talk to you and I really enjoyed the time that we did share, professionally speaking.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. So I'm going to dive in as I'm so curious on your thoughts. So tell us what would be an example of your best boss ever, if you can think back on that?

Eric Wasser:
I can. As I should have, I prepared a bit so that I'd know exactly at least who, and from a profile standpoint, I wanted to talk about. And I'm actually going to name this person by name because I think that they deserve it and would like to have their name recognized in this way. I had a couple of opportunities to work for this person. His name is Jason Reed. Worked for him. He was a senior leader for a company called Office Depot, which many people have heard of in their commercial division. And then later crossover with him as he held a leadership position at Miller Heiman Group, where we shared some time as well.

Eric Wasser:
And there were a lot of reasons that I selected him. In your descriptions of these, you say, you're going to hear stories and you're going to hear how these leaders made people feel. And so, as broad as that is, he made me feel great. He made me feel smart, made me feel valued and then something we can certainly unpack in more detail and important for me, he made me feel safe. And there's just a lot of thought leadership right now about how safety breeds innovation and you have to have a culture of creativity and idea sharing. And I thought he just did an outstanding job with that.

Christine Laperriere:
That is excellent. And I'm smiling because I know Jason Reed. So yet again, I love when these interviews extend into leaders that I've actually worked with. So I think this is excellent. I can't wait to hear more. So you talked about, he made you feel smart, he made you feel valued and he made you feel safe. I'd love you to explain in more detail, especially each one of those traits. What specifically did he do?

Eric Wasser:
I think these hallmark characteristics, I know are ones you've likely heard from other participants in the podcast, right, but I'm going to hone in on the notion of safety because for me, it was especially important. I came to realize in my professional career that I suffered something that many do called imposter syndrome. It doesn't mean that you're not capable. It certainly doesn't mean that you're not able to execute. It just means that occasionally you might feel like you're not delivering the value that you were intended to. And I just thought that Jason did such an outstanding job of being able to shepherd me through those moments where I felt fraudulent, even if I wasn't, and really unlock the potential for me to really capitalize on where I was good. And I could tell you it started from the very first time I met him in the interview process.

Eric Wasser:
So I went to the interview, flew into Florida to talk to him and a couple of other folks and like is often the case we had a couple of hours scheduled, but I remember he and his partners were posing incredibly difficult questions. Ones to which I had no real great answer and I remember regularly answering it first by saying, I'm not sure, or I don't know, or I'll have to think about that. And at the conclusion of that first hour, I was thinking, geez, I didn't hit the mark here. I just wasn't able to give good concrete answers. And I'll never forget him inviting in one of his senior leaders toward the end of that hour and saying, listen, I want you to meet this guy, Eric. He had the best answers to some of our questions because they all started with, I don't know, or I'll have to think about that.

Eric Wasser:
And he said, we're wrestling with very difficult challenges here and we're looking to divine and design approaches that other organizations haven't tackled or taken. So we're really looking for somebody who wants to get involved in that way, rather than somebody that thinks they have all the answers. So he had me hooked right from the beginning, if that makes sense?

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that is fantastic. That is such a good example. I thought what you were going to say, I'm going to admit out loud, that I thought what you were going to say is that he coached you on not starting your answers that way and so I'm smiling over here because the brilliance of being able to appreciate when people start by admitting that they don't know and then talking out loud about what they think. We don't acknowledge what a good trait that actually is.

Eric Wasser:
I agree. And I think it really leads to some of his characteristics and I would characterize him as an egoless leader and that comes up a lot. And so for me to give that some definition, at least from my perspective could be important. It's not that Jason didn't have an ego. He was a highly, highly confident person and you might remember that. And he had a nice big ego, but not when it came to trying to tackle problems or pretending he had the answers to everything. And so his level of vulnerability in recognizing that if he didn't have the answers, he wanted thought partners to help him figure those answers out, was second to none in my career. And I think that's kind of a great way to think about how he unlocked that potential for safety and this feeling that your opinions and your thoughts and how you wanted to approach things would be valued.

Eric Wasser:
And so right from that interview, I felt that, but there were moments where he wasn't shy about giving me direct coaching as well. So you mentioned that. I'd share one that's kind of in keeping with this conversation. So as part of imposter syndrome, he would regularly say I could show up from time to time with these very, very strong and probably correct opinions, but I would all shucks my way through it. Those were his words, right, and I remember him sitting down and saying, stop. No, all shucks. And it became a regular affirmation, if you will, for us over the years that we work together that occasionally, figuratively, as I was going out the door and he would say, hey, no, all shucks, right? Just a reminder to go in there and have the confidence that I should. And I think the reason it was important is I spent a good bit of time as a first line leader, but when I went to work for Jason it was my first exposure to becoming a second line leader in the path to senior leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great and it's funny that you're talking about imposter syndrome because I obviously have a heavy focus on women's leadership. We talk about imposter syndrome a lot, but I love to hear male perspective because my argument has always been that imposter syndrome. It hits a lot of us. It is. It's an interesting phenomenon, if you want to call it that?

Eric Wasser:
And I think the reason that leadership plays such a role in helping what are often very talented people, not that I'm talking about myself, but very talented people who might suffer it is most people could feel very fierce about their belief and self, but a core level. And most people professionally, especially if they've ascended first line to second line, certainly know how to project confidence on the far outside, but you spend most of your time between those two extremes, right? And so if you work with a boss long enough, invariably you have to expose that middle ground. And if you're working with bosses with whom you think you're always supposed to have the answers or have things for figured out, or you get chastised for not having the answers, that makes it hard for you to be vulnerable, to fail, to share bold and big ideas.

Eric Wasser:
And I think that's what Jason did a really good job of unlocking. I'll remember and I'll just give you one anecdote. One of the things that he did regularly with us as a team, he had five or seven direct reports and he was senior vice president role at the time, would be to bring us in to Florida, and I know that's not taking places regularly today, but it would be a virtual meeting today, and express to us exactly what he was wrestling with from his perspective back to the business.

Eric Wasser:
And he would say, I've taken it this far. And he'd give us his perspective. And then he would leave the room for hours and say, I'd like you guys to wrestle with this and try to solve for these things and when I come back, let's talk about how we blend the thoughts that I've had with the thoughts you have and what our plan to bring that back to the business will be. And that just became a regular staple of the way he ran his team meetings when we got together live was to offload almost the real challenge of the business to us and let us wrestle with it. That was phenomenal.

Christine Laperriere:
That's so smart. It sounds like a lot of these practices, again, really tap into the innovation capability of the team in the collective genius, instead of it just being kind of one person's genius.

Eric Wasser:
And I know that your roles in this notion of best boss transcend sales, I've spent the majority of my career in sales, but one thing for sure today, it definitely takes teaming and collaboration to do it successfully. And so for him to be a pioneer in that direction, I think was really important. One of the things you and I talked about in advance, as we thought about this podcast was how did these ideas and these practices influence me? Well, I made that a staple in how I've run my teams ever since. I don't come with all the answers. If I came all the answers and all I was looking for was validation, I don't need a team. Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
So being willing and able to be vulnerable yourself as a leader, bring the challenges that you're trying to solve for to a team and getting people to collaborate around it is an imperative today.

Christine Laperriere:
And I'm curious, as you know I'm in the space of working with leaders and I always bump up against this argument of what's the return on investment. I had a client at the end of last year who wanted me to give out a detailed return on investment of the investment in his leaders being best bosses. And so my question to you, because I'm still trying to figure out how to quantify it, how would you put a measure to Jason's impact to the business in the way that he led?

Eric Wasser:
It's a great question and certainly I don't have a mathematical answer, but I can tell you this, you don't want to bring new people on and train them. Plenty of thought leadership surrounding that people don't leave jobs, they leave the bosses, right? And I can unequivocally tell you that the team that I worked with that surrounded Jason were fiercely loyal to him and prevented a lot of turnover in a very uncertain set of circumstances. When you're trying to tackle something new, you need continuity, you need fortitude and you need teams to come together over longer periods of time than six months or a year to really solve for big profound issues and his ability to keep people intact was also second to none. So I'm not sure exactly how you quantify that unless you look at it account by account or business by business, but being able to keep people is an extremely important part of leadership and being a boss.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's funny that you say that because retention, I've argued retention before, and some people will say, oh, well, we have great retention so what does that matter? But engagement is so hard to, like you said, there's not a mathematical answer, but the ability to hold a team together who continues to fight during a long, difficult challenge, there is numbers there somewhere. We just don't have the alternate reality of what happens when a team continues to fall apart over and over and over again, right?

Eric Wasser:
It speaks to loyalty and I like the way you're framing that in a fierceness and passion toward whatever you're trying to deliver back to the business, right? Everybody coming together for those things and sometimes it takes leaders making tough decisions themselves on what they get behind and what narratives they give back to the business. One of the things I remember well about Jason is how much he would defend us as a team, the things we were working on and our own perspectives and he was particularly good at managing up.

Eric Wasser:
He was fearless about managing up. He would do it sometimes at his own detriment. I'm not going to give the circumstances that surround the story or exactly what company I was working for at the time. I did say I worked for him at two different occasions, but I remember one of my peers stumbling quite mightily on a personal front, making a series of personal mistakes that it influenced some things at business. Nothing that I would say made it incredibly impropitious, putting anyone at danger, but it was the kind of thing where a judgment call had to be made on whether or not this person should stay.

Eric Wasser:
And Jason was willing to take that message up on this person's behalf. Ultimately, the business made the decision that this person could not continue, but his willingness to do so spoke volumes about his willingness to support his people.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
You hear that a lot in all forms of leadership. He wasn't reckless, he wasn't trying to defend something that made no sense to defend, so I need to get that out there, but it was an opportunity where he could have easily just taken the easy route and said, corporate says, but he didn't and he was willing to do that. And he did that quite regularly, even with compensation.

Christine Laperriere:
And you talk about safety. Also, what mindset does that bring if you know that your leader is going to fight for you to the death, right? You know that they are going to go to bat for you in a way that is fierce, I think is the word you said. What does that do when you're working for someone like that to your mindset?

Eric Wasser:
I think safety is such an important word, which is why I sort of led with it, right, and a lot of thought leadership talks about you got to unlock innovation and creativity by creating it and what does it mean? And so it doesn't mean that I always felt that my job was safe. In a sales profession, you do have to deliver on results and metrics, right, but I was safe in that I could share ideas, even if they weren't good. I could have micro failures. I'm going to use your word from before. And that was okay because you can't succeed without a few failures and I never felt like I had to have all the answers. And if you can foster a culture like that, then I think you're a great boss. I think you'll get the most out of people and all you're ever trying to do is optimize the performance of your team, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, this is great. I am really enjoying this. So now, if you were to look at, you don't have to definitely name any names, but I always say working for leaders that weren't your best. You don't have to rank them or anything like that, but the ones that weren't your favorite, what is the thing that you observed or learned from them? Because we learn a lot from our not favorite bosses too.

Eric Wasser:
We do. And it's easy to paint the picture of the opposite, but I'm going to come back to what I tied to, to develop some passion for having this conversation. How does a boss make you feel? Right? And so I can think of one in particular, but several, but I can think of one in particular that just had an act for making me feel like my contribution wasn't that important and then I was dispensable. And I'm going to give you one particular story. I just find it interesting. I was making my first transition from first line to second line leadership. I was about 30 years old and I was doing some open water swimming at that point in my life and I had somehow contracted a little bug, a stomach bug, and it was pretty profound though, because I remember being at a client's office.

Eric Wasser:
I know this is a little weird. So sorry to the audience, but I was at a client's office and got a call from the public health department in the state of Texas. They had chased me down. This was pre everyone having a cell phone at their disposal. And I remember them tracking me down and saying, you've got this bug, it's contagious. You might want to think about getting some medication. You're not in urgent or dire circumstances, but we want to get it addressed. When the health department takes the time to track you down while you're mobile, and you're in a different part of the state, it begs of pretty important circumstances. So I called this particular boss at the time and I remember explaining to them the situation that I had just gotten the call. And I was due to go to one of our largest partners that next day to do a partner review.

Eric Wasser:
And I remember this boss saying, oh, well, you'll be able to take care of that when you get home. And the assumption that I was still going to go to this partner the next day. And I just felt like that was not in my service. And I'm a bit ashamed to say, I made a very poor decision at that time to call the partner and do something I would never ordinarily do and I'm just pointing out that it created unnatural behaviors by me because the way it made me feel. I asked this partner to express that I had come out there for the partner review, even though I had no intention of doing so because I needed to go home and get this addressed and get on the medication. I put the partner in an uncomfortable position, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
And I wish I could get that decision back. I later apologize to that partner for making such a poor decision, but I say these were the downstream byproducts of that kind of leadership that was more about results rather than the people and how they feel.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
So it wasn't that long after that, frankly, that I was interviewing with Jason and saying, I don't know.

Christine Laperriere:
What a great story though. And I appreciate you sharing it, even though it admits a bad decision on your part, but to your exact point. And I guess this is why I'm so passionate about this topic is that you can see how here we have this person who's got fantastic potential. You've proven it. So we know that at 30 you had it because you've proven it in your career, but the irony is that again, working for someone who didn't allow to feel like you could be authentic and prioritize yourself and what was important to you. Again, business first and at the expense of your personal health in this case, right?

Christine Laperriere:
It's just interesting how it does. As humans, we either push back or we try somehow to fold into the pretzel, right, which is kind of what you were doing. It's like you were somehow trying to figure out how to keep him happy, but still honor your health and you had to do it by being inauthentic somehow. Or asking someone else to be inauthentic for you. And it just goes to speak to what culture is. People don't understand what culture is and it's those little tiny decisions that all stack up because if you were doing that, every other person and that reported to that leader was doing something like that.

Eric Wasser:
No doubt. And I can assure you, they were.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly right.

Eric Wasser:
One of the words you used as part of this, and I know it's affectionately related to the podcast, is do a little gossiping, right? A lot of that took place around this particular leader in their predisposition around results over all things, right? And results are certainly important, but at the time to your point, and it's not about me, I was number two in the country at my job function and I decided to take that skillset and my ascension elsewhere because I wasn't able to be the authentic me, good word by you, and compare and contrast that to pretty quickly later being an environment where people were fighting on other people's behalf, even when they made a mistake, and I had made a mistake at that point. No one knew about it. It didn't become public that I had done that, but it just made me feel great about where I was and it made me want to do the right thing always on this person's behalf.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you have any words of wisdom that you want to pass along to anyone that's listening right now, give us, what do you think? There's lots of us out there that are trying to be better leaders. So what can we take from what you've learned?

Eric Wasser:
I think I'm not suggesting that it has to always be about people and you can't manage to performance, because there are opportunities to be direct and give input and feedback, but look for those moments to engage your teams around the work and not after you've figured out what you think the answers to the test are. If you can tie people personally to the work, make them feel invested and give them opportunities to have their voices heard, you'll create fierceness and loyalty. And that's how I felt and as a result, I've followed Jason to two different companies, stay in touch with him to this day and try to maintain contact on a professional basis. I know that's over simple.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's the irony as most of these things are, right? They always sound common sense, but when we're out there working every day with leaders, we know for a fact that they're not common. Excellent. Thank you, Eric. This was so much fun to talk to you. I really appreciate it.

Eric Wasser:
Thanks Christine. Love the opportunity. Thank you.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast


Episode: 9
Title: Caring for your employees
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Laura Joudrey

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome. I am so excited to have Laura Joudrey on the show today. And I just have to start by explaining why I invite each guest on the show. And I had a recent conversation with Laura, and as we were just getting to know each other, she was telling me a little bit about Extend Communications, where she works. And she really had my attention when she started talking about how she's been part of this organization and they've been really focused on creating a great culture. Then she went on to tell me that they also have incredibly low turnover, which is interesting because this business is based around a call center. So I've had some experience with call centers in the past and by nature, that role can be very demanding for individuals.

Christine Laperriere:
And typically it's a high turnover environment. So when she was mentioning this idea of there being great culture, that was very intentionally created and how low the turnover was. I was so curious to learn more that I asked her to come on the show and not only tell us a little bit about your best boss, but tell us a bit about how your organization has been able to accomplish these things. So thank you so much for being on the show, Laura.

Laura Joudrey:
Oh, thank you for inviting me. Again, yes, I'm Laura, and I work for Extend Communications. My title there is CFO and I've worked for 19 years and I love my job.

Christine Laperriere:
I always get excited when I hear someone say they love their job, that you just triggered too a memory because I think you said that when we were talking too, I know you said, "Oh, I, I have to know more." So I'll start by the first question which we always love to start with is to first tell me a little bit about your best boss ever and/or bosses.

Laura Joudrey:
I have had actually two best bosses. They both have really shaped not just my professional life, but my personal life as well. So the first was when I first started actually back in the workforce, full-time after having a family, and this boss was a controller of a large US corporation, which was a very competitive corporation. He gave me an opportunity that I probably wasn't qualified to do, but he had confidence in me. And I think from him, he really encouraged me down the path that my career took today. But more than that, he was so interested and about my success and how I was doing. The thing. I remember the very most about him and that I have always tried to practice in what I do in my career is he was so super busy.

Laura Joudrey:
And every time I wrapped on his door to have a question or I didn't understand something, he was swamp with papers, just piled everywhere on his desk and he would just put them aside and he'd go sit down, and I had his undivided attention every time. He made me feel like I was the most important person, that I was valued, and that what I had to say mattered, and that I deserve to be listened to. That is something that I've taken away with me in my personal life and in my professional life. And I've tried to do it with my kids. I've tried to do it with the people that I work with. Of course, my husband might say, that's not quite true, but he might be the only one that complains about it. But I always do, try to focus when somebody's talking to me. And that's what I took away from that best boss ever.

Laura Joudrey:
And he was great. He was a great person to work with. So my second boss, best boss ever is, of course, why I love my job today, and the owner of Extend Communications, Scott Lyons. There's a million reasons why he's the best boss ever to me and I think to everyone else that works there. First and foremost, I think that he motivates and inspires everyone around him to share a vision for his company that is all inclusive and that creates an incredible culture where, where everyone can enjoy coming to work. That's the goal, love your job, enjoy coming to work, have everything that you need to accomplish and be successful at your job, but even more than that, to be able to grow, and not just grow within the company, the company is growing and has been growing for years and years, and people have an opportunity to move and grow within the company.

Laura Joudrey:
But it goes beyond that, you can use Extend as a stopping ground. You have other aspirations, you have other goals, you have other things you want, other potential, other things you want to do in your life. And it's just his ability to keep you in a job, but to still pursue your dreams or your desires or whatever, and use us as a stopping ground. And even in that, you get the best that people have to offer because you're a part of their development and what they want. So that's basically the culture. The culture also depends very much on excellent communication. And I would say, first and foremost, also on trust, trusting the people that you work with, trusting that the whole aspect of the company.

Christine Laperriere:
So can I ask you some questions? This is great. I love hearing this. So when you think of Scott, if I was to follow him around for a day, tell me how he makes it, number one, known that it's okay to have a fun to like your job or, how does he inspire that enjoying your job so much? And then I'm also curious, how does he inspire trust?

Laura Joudrey:
He inspires you to like your job because he truly cares and is compassionate in how you do your job and what makes you successful in your job. And he's got open lines of communications and he talks to all the employees. An example would be when we all remotely, it was a huge undertaking. We already had remote staff already. So we'd been there and we knew what that looked like, but it's just a matter of moving 80 to 85 people all into a remote environment and making sure that they are able to continue to work and the business is still up and running. So that was a huge undertaking for the senior leadership team, for Scott, for the employees, for everyone. And after that was all done, Scott made it his mission to contact every single employee, contact every employee and say, how's it going?

Laura Joudrey:
How are you feeling? How's life treating you? How are you feeling emotionally? How's this affecting you? Is your family okay? Do you have the tools you need to work with? How's your job? Are you able to do what you want and do you have any problems? Tell me what your problems are. Is there anything I can do to help? And he contacted every single employee. And so that is an example of how he just leads by example, really, by showing that you care and that it's important.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. That's amazing. So I wondered how long it took him to call.

Laura Joudrey:
It took a while.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, that's got to be incredible amount. Now, was that 80 employees or he called everybody that was also working from home or just the 80 that...

Laura Joudrey:
We have a total staff of around 80 to 84 people and he contacted every person. He touched base with every person. And then as a senior leadership team, we met every single day. We kept in touch with our direct reports as well and we the communication was always there, but it was just that extra. And it does. It takes a lot of time and just sitting back and having the time to even just chat.

Christine Laperriere:
And I mean, we always get into this debate sometimes about, what is the impact to the bottom line? Companies are always asking if we should be putting dollars and cents into our people because what is the impact to the bottom line? If you could describe, what do you think the impact was? Even if it couldn't be measured financially, what do you think the impact of that type of practice does?

Laura Joudrey:
Well, I can tell, like just from the feedback that we got and the impact was wow. This person actually cares, not just about the job, not just about that I didn't miss a beat. I continued to answer because I was sent home at such and such a time and it wasn't even that. It was that he actually cared enough to make sure I was okay, and that everything was going fine for me. That in itself, everything... And I must also say that we have an intranet, like a forum post and he was constantly communicating with employees through the forum post, just to give how quickly things were changing and just to make sure everyone was updated. And those two things made people feel safe and they made them feel connected and they made them feel valued and cared about. And I think that that's invaluable in any way you look at it, not just the loyalty that you create but just the sense of wellbeing and the sense of family or whatever you want to call it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. That feeling that we're going to get through this together.

Laura Joudrey:
Exactly. It was always a together thing. And regardless of what obstacles may come in their path, some of it was crazy times, but we managed just fine and we managed because we had an amazing team behind us that was a coherent team that moved forward. And even with the blips that came through and whatever happened, we were moving forward as a team. And everybody was aware of what was going on. There was full transparency and you just had that feeling that things were going to be okay. Do you know what I mean?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, but if you think about it, if you're having a direct dialogue with the leader of the business, the highest leader of the business and you're able to feel comfortable, that that person sees you and cares about you and is thinking about you while they're trying to navigate this crisis, I would imagine from an employee engagement and rail standpoint, people show up for you. They want to follow you.

Laura Joudrey:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that. Any other things that you observe about Scott's leadership that are particularly different or unique?

Laura Joudrey:
I think his leadership is, and I guess, different... Just prio to working for Extend, I had worked for a lot of small businesses. And I do know, as you say, the bottom line is everything and that's what motivates people. I get the sense with Scott that that's not... Obviously the bottom line matters because you have to have a viable business in order to succeed and be profitable and employ people and do good things for them. But his motivation is to make a better life for everyone. And then that broadens out to the community as well. He's very involved in the community and we do a lot of community work. He personally does a lot of community work and along with the business, we do a lot of community work. He's just always looking for ways to increase the employee experience.

Laura Joudrey:
And in that way, it follows through to the customer experience because when you have a happy employee, who likes their job motivated to do a good job, that all goes down. So as our scores for our customers come in, they've been increasing and so is the employee side as well. And so it's all just this tiered effect that just works. But I think at the very base of the whole thing is a genuine since your desire to improve people's lives. And I really do.

Christine Laperriere:
I get a big smile when you say that because the entire reason, like the inspiration behind this show, Best Boss Ever is that I believe as leaders, we're not just responsible for the bottom line, number one. And I do believe that if I took every leader out there and somehow was able to inspire them to be a better boss, to those that they lead, we would actually improve the happiness and success ratio of everyone.

Laura Joudrey:
That's true. That's true.

Christine Laperriere:
Many of us who have worked for a bad boss know how miserable our lives can be when we're working for a bad boss. And even not a bad boss but even just how a mediocre boss, it's fine. We'll get there. But when you work for a best boss, you just see the energy and the enthusiasm of everyday people. And like you said, it improves the quality of their life.

Laura Joudrey:
It really does. It really does. And I know that even examples, like we have grown over the last few years. We grow partially by acquisition. And when we're in that spot, he'll take the senior leadership and he'll go, "Okay, this is what's on the plate. How do you feel about it? Do you think...?" It's always a dialogue. There's always a dialogue. There's always input. He takes input and suggestions from all areas and then base his decisions that everyone contribute.

Christine Laperriere:
So it sounds like he demonstrates a lot of inclusivity too.

Laura Joudrey:
Absolutely. Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Yeah. Well, I'm just curious too, when you talk about turnover being low, especially in an environment that's typically high turnover, I'm curious, has anybody ever done the math on even what that could be financially to the business? Because if you're training people constantly, you know what I mean? And you're constantly onboarding new faces, that's got to be quite a heavy, heavy load for the business.

Laura Joudrey:
And that's exactly it is. We do a turnover rate every year and we evaluate what the turnover was particularly with new hires. And I know years and years ago, when you're still growing and we had a higher turnover and we're training these people, the cost of training people and evaluating how many are lasting the three months, how many lasting six months or a year, and the cost involved of losing somebody within that space of time. So basically, for each employee, it's a good 15,000, at least in order to get them through their first three months. And that's the training and the time and their time. And then to lose them, it, it costs so much and that's what made the big difference with us.

Laura Joudrey:
It's also analyzing that and understanding the types of people that we want to hire. We were just not hiring the correct people. And when we really delved into that and getting our culture, the kind of culture, the kind of place we wanted to be, the kind of people and family atmosphere we wanted to have, and we started being more discriminating on in the sense of a cultural fit rather than other kinds of fit. And once we started doing that and then really supporting people through the training and that it was all those aspects of it as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So you're hiring more for cultural fit, which has become an improvement in the way that the whole organization functions. And then I'm also hearing, you said even stronger support in those early days when you're transferring them.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes, that's a huge part too is figuring out where the support is, figuring out why people were failing, why they weren't being successful and why they were getting frustrated or whatever the case may be. And then going from that and not even with new hires, but as you go down the road and you're putting on new clients, there's all kinds of differences between clients and the way that you would answer for them and just maintain training all the way through that when you're putting on these more difficult clients and that kind of thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is interesting because when I think back to so many different groups I've worked with, when people leave the organization, they have a tendency to blame it on the person who left.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
But what I'm hearing you say is that we actually sit down and try to figure out why that person wasn't successful. So taking accountability for the fact that maybe you didn't set them up for success in some way and that there's an opportunity there, that's some pretty big insight.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes. And that's exactly the way we look at it, that if we can't build a culture and in an environment that people are excited to come to work, are motivated to come to work, feel like they're valued and appreciated if somebody leaves, or for whatever reason, we want to know why actually we want to know way before they would ever leave to have a dialogue with them and figure it out because the real goal is to create an environment where everybody is happy to come to work, motivated to do what they do to the best of their ability, has an opportunity grow and just loves to come to work every day. We don't want people that don't want to come to work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. Yeah. And what a great way to create the cultural fabric of people who are engaged. And people forget... I always say this culture's so interesting because culture, you can't taste it or touch it, but people mirror each other. So if you have that requirement for highly engaged people, as in you're creating the environment to make sure that they feel that it's a place that they want to be highly engaged, again, that can carry a lot of weight. So just when you're seeing your team members engaged in the job and feeling good, you're so much more likely to emulate that than if everybody around you is slogging.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic. I am really enjoying this. Do you have any other insights that you'd like to share for everybody, especially as leaders are listening to this interview today and they're trying to think of how they can improve their own leadership capability??

Laura Joudrey:
I think for us, we have a great senior leadership team and we all share the same vision. We all share the same goal. And because we have that strategy and everything, I have to say from Scott, it's really a strategy that works from the top down as I think any good strategy does. I mean, you can't have it any other way where it's going to work and be effective. And I think it's something that is so rewarding. It's so, so very rewarding and fulfilling to be able to, I don't want to say, give back, but to be able to help and to make an environment where people feel that they can do a great job, the best job that they can, where they're always supported and supporting each other, and they're just working as a team, as one.

Laura Joudrey:
And it sounds difficult perhaps but I know that every single year, when you do your year end and your financials come out, we sit as a leadership team together and we go, "Oh, okay. Now what can we do this year? What can we add that's going to make it better for everyone? And it's just trying to get that aspect of everything so that we're constantly adding. And not just that, but we're getting feedback from everyone. So we're not arbitrarily adding things that perhaps people don't really even care about. We want to know what you want, what you need, what you feel is lacking, what would make it better or how we can change or any feedback you have whatsoever. That's going to make it a better place to work. And I think it's worked out well because I believe we have an exceptional place to work and a very happy workspace.

Christine Laperriere:
Now I just have to ask you one more question because you caught my attention. But when you were talking about, what do we need to add when you get that feedback from your group, I'm just curious, what things are you adding as a response to that team or what are the types of feedback that you get?

Laura Joudrey:
Usually what we are adding when we're talking about that is we're adding things that we can give back to the employees or things that we can add to the employees. By that, I would mean... So one we implemented a wellness fund. So we said, "Okay, every employee is going to get $300 a year, like some five a quarter. They can get their hair done. They can get their nails done. They can do whatever makes them go to the gym, buy that piece of equipment that they've been wanting to." So we added that one year. Another is we have a great professional development plan. So we support anyone who wants to grow. If they're doing it for professional development, that's going to enhance their job or move them up to another position, we pay for it 100%.

Laura Joudrey:
We also have a personal... So if you're a student going to university, we also have a funding for that. So you can get up to $1,000, we pay 50% of your tuition up to a thousand and books up to $1,000. If you wanted to take a pottery course, we would pay half of that, whatever you feel like, music, lesson, a music court, whatever.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Laura Joudrey:
We will support you in doing that. And other things that we've done is we've enhanced benefit programs. We've enhanced a performance bonus program. Every year, there's something that we try to add that will just enhance the culture, and health, and wellness. This year, we added a mental health program where people can access mental health providers get support. They can do an assessment. There's all kinds of mental health because that's been a huge thing as well with the remote work and the pandemic and every else. So those are the examples that-

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. Okay. So I have really enjoyed this interview. What I love hearing too, even those examples, those are real investments. I hear so many companies, they want to improve the workplace, but at no cost. So I get a lot of calls where people say, we're trying to make all these big improvements, but we don't want to spend a dime. So we're trying to do it off the side of our desk but I always say, it shows that there's not a prioritization of it. If we wouldn't put any investment to it but what I'm hearing here, I mean, every example you've stated, these are real investments. They're not just talk.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes, that's right. This was so much fun for me, especially because I have an absolute love and passion for hearing about what the best boss ever do. And I love to hear how companies are creating these really one of a kind workplace that people aspire to stay at and be happy. So thank you. This was very informative and I hope that this was great for our listeners as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank You, Laura.

Laura Joudrey:
Well, thank you very much for having me, Christine.

Episode: 26
Title: Engaging people in a non-profit organization
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Christopher Gruits 

Christine Laperriere:
All right.
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast.
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and I am thrilled that I have Christopher Gruits on today as my guest.
So really quick, just to start, I always talk about why I invited the guest on the show.
Amazingly enough, Chris Gruits and I have known each other since we were 12.
We were actually seventh grade sweethearts.
So I'm going to just start inviting all my sweethearts from the past onto the show.
The best boss ever show.
But the part that's so cool about Chris is that he has a very, very successful career in the arts, and we've been fantastic friends ever since.
What I really am excited about today is that we're going to talk about leadership in a very different industry.
Most of the time we talk corporate, but today it's going to be a bit different.
So Chris, nice to have you on and please introduce yourself.
Welcome.

Christopher Gruits:
Thank you.
It's great to see you and talk to you.
So my name is Chris Gruits.
I'm the executive and artistic director of the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, or Penn Live Arts at the University of Pennsylvania.
And so that's the second largest performing arts center in the Philly Metro.
And my career has mostly been in arts, culture and education.

Christine Laperriere:
And so I'm just going to dive in our big question of the day.
Who's your best boss ever? 

Christopher Gruits:
Well, it was interesting when you kind of tasked me with thinking about this.
I was pleasantly surprised looking back at my career, which has, you know, truthfully been in a variety of different places, geographically types of institutions.
And I was pleased to realize that I had a lot of really great bosses.
I had a lot of great leadership and a lot of great mentoring.
So I have a couple, but certainly I would say one of them was the head of marketing, somebody I worked for at a large cultural institution in New York.
I was really brought in to head up digital strategy for this institution.
And, you know, arts and culture is a kind of a unique business.
These are nonprofit business models, so they're mission driven, but they function at a very high level, at a very high level programmatically, curatorially.
They're bringing in artists from all around the world and serving audiences.
So I think in this business, you're really balancing both the kind of mission driven program with a very kind of brass tacks sales operation.
You have to sell tickets, you have to sell subscriptions, you have to get people in the door.
So it's very just like any business.
But the other component, of course, is fundraising.
So engaging donors and kind of your mission and your vision.
And so at that place, I had two bosses that were really great.
The first is the director of marketing.
And something that I always admired about how she managed was, she always really managed with context.
So if you think about transparency and management, this is obviously a big buzzword these days.
Everybody wants transparency.
And when you really consider it, you know, in my view, transparency really is about context.
How are you kind of identifying the why for the people that you manage and that team that you lead? Why are we doing this? Why are we making this decision? And I think in her case, she always identified the why and she always took the time to kind of talk it through with us.
We weren't just tasked with get this campaign out the door.
We got to hit the sales target.
That certainly was part of it.
But the reason we were doing it at that point in time or the why of doing it, it's supporting this program in this way.
We're trying to reach this audience in this way.
And that really gave us a different sense of purpose and mission in a lot of our day-to-day.
We really felt like we all understood we were all kind of buying into a larger purpose, which in a lot of ways is very important for nonprofit workers and managers.
They're all working in this industry, not for the money, but really because of the mission and because they get out of bed in the morning really excited about the mission of that organization.


Christine Laperriere:
Such a good point.
How do you engage people in getting all the heavy lifting done, especially I would imagine in your world? How do you get all that heavy lifting done when people, again, aren't getting paid the corporate dollars and they're not getting...
So how do you get them excited and motivated and engaged, right? 

Christopher Gruits:
Yeah, absolutely.
I think that what a lot of people don't realize about nonprofit management is that you're always under-resourced, right? You never have enough staff.
You never have enough resource to get things done.
People are very committed.
They're really working at an incredibly high level, managing multiple projects, multiple tasks with far less resources than a typical corporate environment.
And so I think in this case, my boss at the time really was able to kind of ignite passion in all of us.
We felt a sense of purpose.
And I think that was primarily a result of the fact that we had the context.
We understood the kind of background.
Something that she did which I thought was fantastic is as a senior manager, as basically a vice president at the institution, she would attend senior meetings and whatever she could share with her team that was not embargoed or not confidential, she would share with us.
She would give us updates about like what the big strategic conversations were.
And of course she had the blessing of CEO, but it was really about giving us the full picture.
So even some of the team that I managed as a director, kind of an email manager, for instance, they would understand why their emails were so important, why they were trying to communicate the program, what the CEO was thinking about programming for that particular week.
So the context I think really aided in a lot of our kind of bigger purpose and motivation.
I just thought that was a fantastic way to manage.


Christine Laperriere:
It makes so much sense, again, to rally people around a big vision, right? And then you said there were two of these great managers.


Christopher Gruits:
So I was really lucky to kind of grow up professionally at this place.
And I think the other person would definitely be the CEO.
This is somebody who is a mentor for me, who opened a lot of doors for me.
And I think in both of these cases, both of these bosses that I'm referencing, something as I thought about this or your podcast, something that really occurred to me is that in both cases, they really leveraged their professional networks for me and for other colleagues.
There was never this kind of position of, well, I'm the boss and I'm the only one who has access to this broader network of professionals and artists.
They were very ready to really leverage their professional network to give me resources to connect me with people who might aid in my own career trajectory.
And that made all the difference for me professionally.
They were very good about connecting me to a wide variety of people nationally and internationally that really opened a lot of doors.
So I would say in this case, the CEO of the institution where I worked, he was just a really remarkable driven visionary for our industry.
And getting back to this idea of context and transparency in a lot of strategic discussions with him when we were talking about institutional strategy or in these institutions, you're presenting programs for the public, performance programs, you're bringing your artists and working with them.
And a lot of it was he really led through asking questions through curiosity, I would say, why are you thinking that? How can we do this better? It wasn't necessarily we're going to be doing this and this is happening at this date.
It was more about what are we considering here? What are all of the facets that we can consider as a collaborative group? At the end of the day, he would make the decision, but it was really about walking us through a process of curiosity, of discovery and really collaborating to come up with what we thought was the best approach.

Christine Laperriere:
And that curiosity piece, I mean, it's so interesting how that creates like a more level playing field when you're trying to collaborate.

Christopher Gruits:
It's really true.
You certainly know with a CEO, a leader, they're in charge, they're the boss, obviously.
But we never felt like our perspective was taken for granted or we didn't have a say, if that makes sense.
It felt like we really were contributing that we all were kind of playing our part on really every level of the organization.
And I think that when you think about senior management and large institutions or companies and the CEO, of course, as you know, sets the tone, he or she sets the kind of culture in a lot of ways with that leadership team.
And I always thought it was so impressive that that really trickled down to the director level, the managerial level, that we really felt like, hey, we actually have helped make this decision or at the very least, we know why this decision has been made.
We know why these programs are going out the door next month or why we're scheduling things in this particular way.

Christine Laperriere:
So if I was a fly on the wall in a meeting with this particular CEO, can you just give me some play by play of what a meeting would look like? 

Christopher Gruits:
Sure.
So we would a lot of times be talking about curatorial decisions.
And so this CEO is also the artistic director.
And in my business, that really means they're the person that curates the season.
So it invites world-class artists and performers to the stages to perform for the public.
And so the quality of those artists, the types of artists are really at the highest level internationally.
And so that's a very interesting and very challenging business.
It's very tough to get artists to come to your venue to perform.
A lot of the time, you're managing tours.
A lot of the time, you're really always trying to stay ahead of the curve, right? It would be similar to a corporate setting where you're trying to do R&D to come up with that next product line to stay ahead of the curve for your customer segment.
And so in a lot of ways, he would walk us through curatorial decisions.
He would frame a decision and say, we're going to approach a festival, let's say next year, and it's going to be focused on this composer, on this artist, for example.
And a lot of the challenge was how can we best communicate that to the audience or what are some ideas or approaches we should consider for the paying audience? How do we best frame it for them? And then he would kind of task us with this challenge.
And as we would talk through that idea, for example, how do we best communicate this composer or how do we structure this festival? He would really ask so many questions and you would really be in a meeting where it's like, oh gosh, really, are there more questions, you know? But what I realized is that those questions really drew out a lot of different fantastic ideas and they weren't necessarily direct kind of straight ahead questions at the start.
He would kind of ask them from different angles, you know, well, okay, we're thinking about this composer, why is this important, for example? Why would an audience think this is important or why is this time of year optimal within the broader context of the season? And so that kind of questioning really, I think brought out a different level of consideration.
It really gave us just a broader view of why we were doing something and it led the team to feel like they had really considered and thought deeply about that particular program, project or initiative.

Christine Laperriere:
That is amazing.
Now I'm kind of curious when you think of any other people, first of all, that have shaped your leadership, even outside of let's say bosses, like is there anyone else that comes to mind? Because you've met, you know, world-class musicians from literally all over the world.
You've just worked with an incredible pedigree of people.
So I'm curious when you think of other people that have influenced your leadership, I'm curious who comes to mind.

Christopher Gruits:
So there are several people.
I guess I would generalize to start to say that the leaders that I've admired have always really clearly defined the future.
And so the examples I just gave you, that was more about context and curiosity and leading through collaboration and discovery, really having teams understand the why.
But ultimately all of those leaders and so many bosses that I've had have always defined the future.
They've really always defined for us where we're going and why we're going there and then communicate it over and over and over and over again, right? I mean, so many of us know, you know, in leading teams, like how much you have to communicate to that team to constantly remind them.
And I think as a manager and as a leader, you might feel often that you're just repeating yourself or you're beating a dead horse.
Oh my gosh, I'm telling them again what we're doing.
But I don't think you can ever communicate enough.
And when we're talking about organizational strategy or corporate strategy, departmental strategy, it really is about defining that future for folks so that they are operating under really clear guidelines and ideas about where we're all going.
Because it really, I feel in so many ways, empowers your team to make decisions based on that broader strategy that everybody's bought into.
So the best bosses I've had have always really defined that future and constantly brought us back to evaluating where we were.
I remember another institution that I worked at in Michigan.
We had an organizational strategic plan that everyone had put together and it was a five-year strategic plan.
And so often strategic plans are created with a board of directors and the executive staff and the team.
And then they're kind of just, you know, put away.
They're filed away and you've got a nice fancy report that you paid a lot of money for.
But they don't necessarily revisit it.
And in this case, what I thought was so impressive is the executive team and the organization set up a website that really was structured for both the board and the staff that had kind of a very kind of quantitative approach to our strategic goals.
So we would have goals listed by area, marketing, for example, or education or whatever.
And they would have kind of a red, green, or yellow process light around that goal.
So that at any point in time, and this sounds so silly to relate it now because it's so simple, right? You could, as a staff member, as a board member who is supporting the institution, really just dip in and see, well, where are we on that goal of increasing educational customers by 100% or whatever it was? Oh, we're at green.
We've accomplished that.
And here's how we accomplished it, right? With the brief summary.
And then when we would get to all staff meetings a couple of times a year, we would revisit these larger strategic goals from the plan and kind of look at the metrics and look at that yellow, green, red to see, well, yeah, we did.
And oh, by the way, here are a few that are in that yellow category that we really haven't moved the needle on.
Let's really revisit this and refocus on this.
And so I think that goes back to this idea of setting the direction, right? We've all collaborated to say, here's the direction we're going.
But then really communicating over and over where we are in that journey.
And as a manager myself and as a CEO now myself, I really have learned that that is so vital for teams to really understand where you are in that process.
So definitely bosses who did that effectively, the one in Michigan that I referenced was really a really fantastic experience.

Christine Laperriere:
That's such a smart idea.
Like that idea of having a place where everybody can go back and see the strategic goals.
The red, yellow, green is so simple.
It's like our brains, we want the quick answer, right? Like are we on or are we off? That's what most of us really wanna understand.
To your point, I see a lot of my clients do that where there's big, heavy strategic goals and then they kind of get tucked away and we just get busy doing tactical execution.
And a year later, everybody kind of looks back and goes, oh, I might've hit the mark on one or two but not quite so many, right? 

Christopher Gruits:
And I feel like it's a great point because I feel like so often, I would say particularly in the corporate world, but it also happens at nonprofits, we're really focused on our quantitative measurements.
What was our revenue? Right, what are our numbers? We're having our quarterly meeting.
What's our expense budget look like? What is our revenue looking like? We're really good at keeping track of those but tying them back to those broader strategic efforts, I think a lot of companies miss, a lot of organizations miss.
So I think if we can be good and kind of regimented around looking at our number goals, our sales goals, our engagement goals, et cetera, we have to tie those back to that larger strategy and really say at those times, take 15 minutes in your quarterly check-in with the sales department or whomever to say, okay, and how does this tie back to your department strategic goals? Where are you on those? And that connection between those two levels, I find a lot of bosses don't do but the bosses who do do that, I think just lead through much greater transparency.
They are giving you, they're reminding you of this direction in defining that future that you're headed toward.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm just curious, when you think of the not best bosses you've worked for, that's always my favorite question.
Right, I've never had any of those.
You've never had a not great boss, so we know that but just let's say from other people's stories.

But no, it's just kind of interesting.
What are some of the traits that you've seen that for you personally were disengaging or the toughest traits for you to work for? 

Christopher Gruits:
It's a great question.
So I think that we all have had kind of the micromanager supervisor or boss who just really wants to control everything down to every last detail.
And so I think, of course, those are tough circumstances to work under, particularly if you're operating at a high level or you're achieving the goals in your job.
It's one thing if you're not doing your job and the manager has to step in, of course.
But so I think that kind of approach to kind of micromanagement is really challenging but something that I've always found with bosses, the bosses who are very protective of hierarchy and very protective of networks.
So you as kind of a 20 something assistant, for example, or manager trying to learn and trying to grow, those folks who really didn't want you in the room, who really kind of leaned on that hierarchy to kind of not bring people together, not bring them in, not let them have access to their professional network.
I always found that really challenging because of course you're not setting up an environment where a person can learn and grow and do better at their job.
And so that was always, I think, the more challenging type of aspects from the not great bosses.
Something else I thought about in thinking about the best bosses was my boss in New York, the head of marketing that I mentioned, she would always bring in guest speakers for us.
She would bring in people from outside of our organization who worked in the same industry to come talk to us to do like a coffee chat about what they were working on or some best practice that they were talking about or referencing.
And that provided so much outside expertise and influence.
And it not only was saying, hey, she was humble enough to say, there's people who know more than me in this particular area.
So I'm gonna bring them in and have them talk to you about what we're trying to achieve.
So it kind of, it was a great degree of humility in that sense, but also it gave us kind of a broader view or a wider view of our industry, which I think a lot of people forget when they're working in a big company or a big organization.
But certainly to answer your bad boss question, it was those folks who were the opposite of that, who didn't want you in the room, who didn't wanna connect you and really were very, very focused on the hierarchy and like who works for who.


Christine Laperriere:
When I hear that, it makes me feel like you're always being sent to the kids' table.


It's like you can't eat at the adult table.
You gotta go sit at the kids' table.
And you're always like, but really I'm not a kid.
Right, yeah, and I wanna learn.
I can handle what you're gonna talk about or whatever.
It's really interesting when you mention that too, because I can see where, even the protective with networks, as you introduce people to your network, it's a sign of confidence and trust and credibility.
And so it's very emotionally confirming that that person sees you as credible and sees you as valuable.
Whereas when they're hiding you in the closet, it's like, I don't feel very valued right now.

It's like, please, please you're not allowed to see the front of house kind of a thing.
So I think that's a great, great example.
Just to bring this to close, if you had to teach or advise future leaders on something, I mean, I hear your big points today around context and I really like your point around defining the future.
Can you give me a really tactical tip that you would give somebody who's really aspiring to be a best boss? 

Christopher Gruits:
That's a great question.
I think when you're managing a team, whether it's a department or a small team, even if it's one or two people, I think in whatever functional area that you're operating in, I think it's really important to take time and to reflect on how you fit within the larger picture.
So I think we're very task oriented in America.
This is something that's just part of our business culture.
It's like, you gotta get your tasks done.
You gotta move on.
And I think as a manager, certainly managers are always trying to balance task-based work and leaders are trying to move, certainly at a top leadership level, away from tasks and more managing other people's work and focusing on strategic decisions and partnerships, for example.
But I think if you're managing any team, you really have to step back and say, why are we doing this? How does this connect to the company's overall strategy? What's our piece of it? And why is that piece important? And if you don't take time to do that, people are just working in a vacuum.
They're just doing their tasks.
They're just completing and they may be getting them done, but they're not gonna be motivated over the long term to kind of deliver for you.
So I think that would be something that I feel is really important as managers.
You're connecting back to that bigger picture and again, communicating it over and over.
I also think of course, as managers, our job really is to help our employees grow.
The best outcome for you as a manager is your employee that's been working for you, that they're doing a phenomenal job.
You've connected them to your own professional network and help them leverage informational interviews and other opportunities.
And if they leave, that's not ideal for your day-to-day business in the short term, but it means that if they're going on to something better, you've really done your job as a manager.
And I think that I referenced my earlier CEO in New York, so many of the people that I worked with at the institution are now leading other institutions around the country.
And that's really a result of his mentorship and his investment in all of us.
So I think that that investment, after setting the direction, defining the context, really that investment in your people, of course, is the most important thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Just to kind of wrap this up, it makes me think when you're talking, I obviously work with over a hundred leaders a year and one of the things that we get really good at is teaching leaders how to coach and develop.
And the reason that that skill becomes important is because you might have turnover as people's careers advance, but if you love the teaching development and growing of your people, you really are never gonna have a problem.
It's your insurance policy.
So if you're just good at cultivating talent, you don't have to be scared if your talent goes on.
And the other thing is, is that then you start playing a long game.
So you're now influencing an industry and your reach is now all the way across an industry versus being just myopic and in your four walls.
And I think we gotta get leaders to think much bigger because just like you said, that great CEO you worked for who is busy connecting you to people outside of, in his network, you obviously have since moved on to another organization, but his reach is still there, right? And I'm sure your loyalty to him is gonna be there forever, right? 

Christopher Gruits:
Absolutely.
I think that's such a great point, Christine.
I think so much of that obviously is contingent on doing a good job, right? So let's preface the whole idea with, as an employee, you need to be doing an outstanding job and you need to deliver on your job.
But if you are and you have that type of boss or leader, you're absolutely right.
It's gonna pay dividends down the road and you're really gonna see more of an industry-wide impact over time.
Because yeah, leaders connecting their employees to their broader network can make all the difference for people as they develop their career, absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, thank you so much for coming on the show.
This was awesome.
And I know for a fact that my audience is gonna love this.
So thank you, Chris.
Thank you, Christine.
It's been great.

Title: Confidence and decisiveness attracts top talent
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Laura Todd

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome back to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and today I am speaking with Laura Todd. I'm really excited to have Laura on the show because this is one of my favorite versions of how we create a guest. Laura reached out after hearing the show and she said, I have a best boss that I'd really love to talk about. And so for me, this is the perfect way to use this platform is to shine a light on fantastic bosses that are creating a difference. So Laura, thank you so much for coming on the show and I'll give you a chance to introduce yourself. 

Laura Todd:
Yeah, thank you for having me. My name is Laura Todd. I work for Baxter Corporation. And like Christine said, I had actually heard the show from a referral and it really hit me because I'm just kind of stepping into senior leadership and I'm always looking at how I can be that best boss. And so it's interesting to hear different perspectives. So I think this is a resource that we need and I think it will be really helpful for others to hear different perspectives and what drives everybody else. 

Christine Laperriere:
Who sent you the show? 

Laura Todd:
Yeah, so my best boss ever, Fiona, actually sent me the show and she is always sharing different resources with me, which I think kind of feeds into our mentorship relationship. And once she sent it to me and I started listening, the irony was kind of killing me because I thought, well, I think Fiona's that for me. And so I'd love to share kind of my experience with Fiona and just how, how she really inspired me. 

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. So do tell us more. Obviously my first question is always, who's your best boss? Sounds like we have her identified. Tell us a little bit more about Fiona. What is it like to work with her and what are some of the things that really make her a best boss? 

Laura Todd:
I can remember my interview with Fiona. Like it was yesterday. I remember she kind of walked into the room, started a casual conversation with me. I think she asked me maybe two to three questions with some open dialogue in between. And within about three to four hours after that meeting, I had a job offer presented to me. And so my upfront kind of interaction with her showed her decisiveness and her bias for action. And I think that oftentimes we see kind of the slow bureaucratic movement of, of how things can go and her ability to really push things forward and, and know when she's kind of had that connection was a really great first impression. And then the next great impression I had was when I met the team. So I remember going in and they had a weekly meeting where it was kind of the operations leadership team and they all had did round table and they had an agenda. And I remember looking around the room and thinking, Oh man, these people are smart. And I I'm sure people have heard it, but you never want to be the smartest person in the room. If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. And I felt like I was just surrounded by the most high functioning team. And I think that's a really important tribute to their leader because she ultimately kind of assembled that team and made them and motivated them into who they were. She showed that you can bring a diverse group together and that doesn't mean it's always going to succeed. And so I think it's a, it's, it's definitely a tribute to her leadership in that sense. 

Christine Laperriere:
And that right there speaks volumes, you know, but it's not just her leadership, you know, a lot of people shine a light on their best boss, but what I think is really interesting is when you're looking around at the people that you're working with, they're performing at a pretty incredible level. And so that's, that's also pretty, like you said, very impressive because she assembled that and created that. 

Laura Todd:
Absolutely. Yeah. I think that that's kind of her, I would say, I think she would actually attest to that as well, that her legacy is always her high functioning teams and that she wants to assemble those high functioning teams and she wants to be the leader that takes them to that next level. And it was just clear right off the bat. It was clear the way they work together. It was clear the way they challenged each other. There was always respectful challenges. People willing to question each other, ask uncomfortable questions. And I think that you need to have an environment that that feels safe. And that's not always the case. And so again, just kind of a tribute to, to how she led the team was visible right off the bat. 

Christine Laperriere:
If we could, I mean, obviously she's not here right this moment, but if we could pick her brain on how she procures those people for the team, do you have any thoughts now that you've kind of watched her in action? 

Laura Todd:
So when she's talking to people, she truly listens. And I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's really easy to always be kind of thinking of what's coming next and not being present in the moment and she, she listens to people she observes and she trusts her network and that's, I guess, another aspect of this is that a lot of her team came through referrals through other members of her team. And when you, and when you trust the people that you've brought in, they like working for you and they want to bring in other high performing talent. And so it's almost like a magnet. And I think that Fiona has created a little bit of a magnetic field around her where she attracts good people because she's good to work for. 

Christine Laperriere:
See, that's incredible. So I'm always looking for what is the real needy benefit of having a best boss. Obviously I'm working with leaders who are trying to aspire to be best bosses and it's always a trick of what is the, the metric, right? What is the financial benefit to the business by having a best boss versus just a good one, right? But, but when you say that immediately, it just gets me excited because it's such a perfect example that her being a best boss is such a huge talent attraction. So then that team by nature is going to perform head and shoulders above. 

Laura Todd:
Yeah. And, and to your point, I mean, I think oftentimes the P and L reflects the leadership style. And so if you can create that strong team that is directly reflected both qualitatively and quantitatively, cause you're going to see it at your bottom line. And the other thing is, is that the financial aspect of companies isn't just their success, but their predictability. And that's another aspect of Fiona that she was really strong with is she always knew what was going on with her business at all times because she wasn't afraid to get into the details. And so if I felt like I had something that was on the horizon or something that she should be privy to her door was always open. She was always willing to listen. And I know that it's easy when you, as you move up into senior leadership to forget that the people below you see things you don't see. And so you need to be able to trust her team to guide you. And she always trusted her team to guide her towards what was happening next. And I think that was reflected in her P and L being predictable and, and trustworthy. There was no big swings up and down. There was, there was predictability and preparation, which is, which is huge for a business. 

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that's fantastic. I love the business case behind what the real benefit, right? There's real, meaningful, right? You know, as we were doing a little bit of prep, of course, it caught my ear about how she has supported your career, given the fact that you also have had two children. 

Laura Todd:
Yeah, absolutely. I think this is the biggest thing that I will always respect and remember about Fiona and something that I will carry with me throughout my career. I found out that I was expecting my first child a week after I started with Baxter. And so I had this huge opportunity. I was so excited to join Baxter. And I also was so excited to start my family, but my excitement was almost overshadowed by a little bit of guilt around the timing. I was just jumping into this goal and I felt like I was disappointing the organization and my leader. And so it was very conflicting. And I remember when I got to the point where I was, I was ready to tell Fiona, this is kind of what's going on. And I walked into her office and we just started chatting and I, and I told her, and I had this lump in my throat, like, like almost like when you're a kid, you feel like you're going to get in trouble. And I remember she just looked at me with a completely straight face after congratulating me and just said, Laura, women have babies. Women have babies that should not impact your career. And you should never be concerned about what that's going to do to your career. It's not something that we can control. And it's a beautiful part of life. And that was that. And she never treated me different after that point. And with that being said, I worked really hard for her. I mean, she knew she was going to get nine months out of me. And I wanted to spend those nine months doing the best that I could do for the organization and three weeks prior to going on maternity leave, she actually presented me with a promotion. And so it actually went into effect while I was on maternity leave, which is fairly unheard of. And it really puts some emphasis behind her words. They weren't empty words. They weren't just kind of a stock congratulations. She truly meant it. And she showed me that just because you're going to start a family and just because you need to kind of sit on the bench for a year doesn't mean that you're going to be held back or that your work is not going to be acknowledged. And I, and that really changed my life. And it was huge for me going into leadership, understanding that, like she said, women have babies and we need to find a way to support them. And we need to find a way to make sure that they don't miss out on opportunities because of that part of life. 

Christine Laperriere:
It's so true. And I mean, men are fathering babies. But it's interesting how their wife gets pregnant and they're not having the lump in their throat or they're not feeling sheepish when they walk into their boss's office to deliver the news. And so it's just such an interesting problem with the equality issue that we face because, you know, as women, I know for me, I started with an apology and I had had a horrific time getting pregnant. So it was just so ironic to be ashamed of getting pregnant. And thankfully, I was talked out of that pretty fast. A couple of great, great leaders that I work alongside who were just like, this is reason for celebration. And I'm like, it is. That's all I really want to do is celebrate. But meanwhile, you know, I feel it's hard to not be worried that the perception of you somehow changes. 

Laura Todd:
Oh, totally. And I think the big thing to remember is you do change when you become a parent. And that was, I think, another area that Fiona really helped me learn, because she's a mother herself. And when when I was coming back from maternity leave, I had no idea kind of what that was going to feel like. I am extremely career driven. I love working. I love my career. And I remember coming back from maternity leave thinking, I can't do this. I can't leave my little one. It's this is going to kill me. And the way she supported me kind of through that transition, she got me excited about work again without feeling like I was dropping the ball with my son. And as someone who's heading into leadership and who is now moving into managing bigger teams, I didn't understand that. I managed moms and I and I knew woman to woman. Hey, we have to they can't five o'clock meetings are right in the middle of dinner. Six o'clock is bath time. And so this is so I knew that, but I didn't know it until I lived it. And so I think not only her being so graceful with me and her walking me through that through me living it, I now have such a different empathy and support for women as a leader. And I think that it was just it fundamentally changed me. And I think she was really the one to attribute to that. 

Christine Laperriere:
It's amazing. Any other things that you want to add to that about kind of her leadership and kind of the power of some of the great things that she does? 

Laura Todd:
Yeah, I think honestly, I think the way she empowers her team to do really hard things is done so by understanding who everyone is. So the thing I have to remember is when she was kind of changing my life by promoting me and supporting me through this, there were 20 other people on her team that she had to manage that all felt that same support. And so they weren't necessarily going on maternity leave at that time. They weren't necessarily navigate. They were navigating completely different life challenges because as much as it's easy to forget, there's life outside of work. And so her team satisfaction showed that she wasn't just doing that for me. She was doing it for everyone on her team. And that takes her ability to stop and listen to her team and understand what's important to who and when and learn how to honor everybody in a different way. That makes them feel like they're a valuable member of her team. 

Christine Laperriere:
How does she do that? Like, how does she like, is it through flexibility? Is it through like how to tell me a little bit more about how she makes 21 of you all feel valued when you're all so different? 

Laura Todd:
I think she respects our differences as opposed to trying to make us all be one. And I think it's really easy to try and kind of lump your team together. So for me, what was important to me was that I had fairly strict work hours for drop off and pick up at daycare. And I wasn't willing to sacrifice that unless it really had to be done. And so she never scheduled meetings outside of those hours with me. She knew that if she were going to send me an email at 7 p.m., which she really did, that she would know that I would get back to her the next morning with other people. They they maybe needed to work from home a couple more days a week because of a different she was flexible. She she understood that if your job was getting done, it doesn't really matter how it gets done. And so if somebody works really well from four to 7 p.m., why are we forcing them to be online in a meeting from eight to 11? And so I think I think she just enlisted various tools of understanding what everybody needed and being flexible to those needs. And of course, there was we all had to work together and find a common ground. But she found a way to to make a team work well together in all different ways. 

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. Very cool. Just out of curiosity, when you think of you're not best bosses, maybe you've never had one. But what have you experienced in your career that really didn't work well for you? 

Laura Todd:
I can't say that I have a singular kind of worst boss that jumps out. I mean, but there are aspects of different bosses that I have had that are things that I've kind of filed in the back of my head as I'm not going to do that. And so kind of a couple of examples of that is you need to be willing to get your hands dirty. And so the biggest thing is you can't ask your team to do anything that you wouldn't do yourself. And so I've definitely worked for some leaders that that aren't interested in the details. They're not interested in kind of how we got here. They want the Coles notes and the Coles notes only I can give that to anybody who needs that. But at the end of the day, if you only have the Coles notes, you're not understanding how you got there and you're not understanding how you take your team to the next level. And so one thing that's always kind of been important to me and that I still value is I'll get my I'll get into Excel and I'll throw together spreadsheets and I'll do the analysis myself if my team needs that. I'll I'll jump into the tactical side of things, because if you're asking your team to do something that you that you're not willing to do, that is extremely demotivating. And so that's kind of I would say the big one that jumps out of me. The other one is just treating people like a number. Another name on a page. Like I said, it's really easy to forget that we're people. There's more outside of this work. And I think I think it's important to say, you don't need to ask me. You need to tell me what's going on. And so that was another area that Fiona was very good at is don't ask me if you can make a doctor's appointment. You tell me, hey, look, I'm going to the doctor's on Wednesday 12 to two. I'll be offline. And you need to trust that your team is is getting what they need to get done within the parameters that they have set and being supportive of that, because because kind of as we touched on, everyone's going through something different. Some have small children that they need to be available for. Some have ailing parents that they need to be available. There's things all over. And so listen to your team and respect your team as people, not just as workers. 

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I absolutely agree. And I think to your point, it's easy when you're just trying to chase metrics and results to forget to slow down enough to acknowledge each person. 

Laura Todd:
For sure. And that's and that's actually some feedback that I have definitely kind of had to learn throughout my time. I'm I'm fast. What I when I work, I get things done quickly. And I think there has been times in my past where I I forget to bring people along with me. And so Fiona did a really good job sometimes just being like, Laura, stop. Just stop and think about the big picture here. And how are you going to bring people along? Because it doesn't matter if you have the best idea, if no one's willing to execute it with you. And so that's another aspect is you don't always have to be the first one with the best answer. You need to be the person who can get the group to get the job done and do it together. 

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. We already talked about metrics, which I think you did a fantastic job of kind of explaining what that force field can look like when you're attracting in great talent and you're able to retain them and get them to really be these high performing teams for you. I think you've really answered that question for me. So I'm just going to come to, you know, kind of one of my closing questions, which is if you had to teach or advise future leaders on how to be a best boss, give me some really tactical advice. Like, how could they implement this in a very useful way? 

Laura Todd:
Get to know your team. So make sure you take time to talk with everyone on your team in a way that's not we have an objective to this meeting. So if it's a 15 minute touch point with your team, do it. It will always be worth it. And pay attention to what's important to them. That's kind of the first thing for me, I would say. And then the other thing is, is don't forget the details. That's going to reflect on your P&L. You need to be able to speak intelligently about your numbers. And you also need to understand what your team's going through. So I understand that not everybody can get into all the details all the time. That's why you have your teams, but know what's going on. Have your eyes on on what's going on at all different levels and make sure that you can speak intelligently to what what the numbers are saying so that you know where you need to focus extra energy and where you may have kind of risks and opportunities in your P&L. 

Christine Laperriere:
And then, you know what, I'm going to throw in one last question, too. I was just thinking about this. What, from a leadership perspective, have you or Fiona or, you know, again, kind of what have you noticed has been so mission critical as you've had to lead through COVID? 

Laura Todd:
That's a good question. So the biggest thing I would say is the virtual world is not working for everybody. I think it's offering a lot of flexibility that we were maybe missing in our lives. Baxter is already a fairly flexible organization, so not a huge impact there. But people are trying to balance being moms, dads, teachers, full time employees, therapists. They're they're trying to balance so many hats and they're being asked to do the impossible. And so understanding how in this virtual world you can still connect with your team. One thing I did last year was we had a weekly meeting with my direct reports. And instead of it being business related whatsoever, it was 30 minutes weekly. We picked a random challenge. You basically played a game and joked around on a Zoom for 30 minutes. You got points and whoever had the most points got a gift card. And it seems so trivial, but it was probably 30 minutes a week where I saw a large group of people laugh together that I wasn't seeing anywhere else. 

Christine Laperriere:
Right. What kind of what kind of challenge? I mean, tell me. I love this idea. 

Laura Todd:
So we did there's it's called like draw something online. So we would that was one week where we were all on a different like whiteboard and you'd have to draw a different picture. And then everyone's guessing it. And whoever gets it right gets the point there. And so that was like one week's game. Another one, we did a work from home scavenger hunt. So there was like a bingo card and whoever went and got their item first came back and had that item and they got the point. And so it was just like silly things that you're trying to navigate. Hey, how do we still have team building virtually? And we would laugh so hard. And like I said, like they're you're not getting together with groups outside of work. You're you're isolated. And the first time where you'd see 10 people all laughing together. And so it was just a really nice kind of midday break that everyone needed. I'm sure it was outside of some people's comfort zones, but it ended up being really great for everybody. 

Christine Laperriere:
You know, I love stories like that, though, because what we're missing is all the small talk and all the the little tiny bits of coffee and one of the things that I talk about a lot when I'm working with, you know, high potential talent is like relatability matters. So like if I can anticipate you and I understand you and I see you as relatable, it's easier for me to anticipate how to work for you and how to get things done. So like if you think of a team on a on a field, they're all trying to anticipate each other, right? They're trying like, are you throwing me the ball or are you not throwing me the ball? Like, you know, it's kind of we're trying to figure out, oh, does the coach want me to grab the ball? Not, you know. And so we're a lot of things are happening silently through anticipation. And a lot of that happens through the relationships that we build that make people relatable. Right. And so, you know, it's just interesting when you talk about this, because the idea of, quote unquote, what might be perceived as wasting a half hour is, in my opinion, actually putting all the glue into the tiny little cracks of the team, you know, that might otherwise kind of wear over time. 

Laura Todd:
Absolutely. And it's tough. Like, I don't doubt. I mean, my normal day was eight hours of meetings. And so it's tough to make time for that, but it's worth it in the end. 

Christine Laperriere:
And like you said, I do think also at this time with all the mental health, we really do have a true mental health crisis happening. I think you've got people laughing and connecting and feeling connected to a group. I think that's probably some of the best the best thing that you can create for people right now. 

Laura Todd:
Absolutely. And I just kind of one closing point, I think the big piece that COVID has has challenged as well is a big thing with office dynamics is you look at kind of impact versus intent. And so when you're emailing or you're instant messaging all the time, I know I can speak for myself. You're very direct. Your emails don't have small talk in them. They don't have that quick chat walking by somebody's office. And so I think sometimes you lose a little bit of your personability that you wouldn't necessarily have lost if you were in the office. And so that's been another challenge navigating that I think people naturally get better at. They'll find better ways to interact virtually. And they'll be more intentional kind of when they are chatting with people and just trying to remember that, hey, there's a there's a person behind there. And we've got to take a step back and always remember that when we're sitting in front of a screen. 

Christine Laperriere:
It's true. And even, you know, again, going back to your team building piece, like when you're trying to deal with conflict, if we're dealing with it over email and or the only time that you have a Zoom meeting is because there's something difficult. It can be, again, very, very tough for people to actually navigate tough conversations. But if you've more recently had a laugh, a giggle, a joke, you can start those tough conversations with like, by the way, that was the best cat drawing I've ever seen. And, you know, warm up the room a little bit and again, feel like you've got some relatability and then you can kind of tackle a tough conversation with a little more emotional intelligence. Right. 

Laura Todd:
Absolutely. Yeah. And it's and it's a lot easier when you can just walk by somebody's office and pop your head in. And so it's just remembering how to do that when that's not your opportunity. 

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Laura, anything else you want to add as we bring this to close? 

Laura Todd:
No way. I think just thank you for the resource that you've provided. I think it's going to be kind of invaluable to those who are looking to further their leadership skills. And I hope it gets shared with more people so that we can continue to hear everybody else's different perspectives and experiences. 

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. It's my pleasure. And this is truly passionate, like a passion project for me. I'm not kidding when I say that when I see the opportunity to interview people like you about your stories, I you know, it makes my day. It fires me up. So it's just fun to do something that naturally is quite enjoyable for me selfishly. Yeah. And then it also happens to be a great resource for you. And so, like I said, that's that's the magic at the win all the way around. 

Laura Todd:
Perfect. Well, thank you so much for having me on. And I appreciate all that you're doing.

Welcome back to the Best Boss Ever podcast.
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and today I have Bea Lozinski with me from Magna.
I always invite guests that I either really admire their leadership or I look up to them or I've had some really great interaction with them and I've had the opportunity to work with Bea on an event at Magna and I just really admired her leadership.
I could see her style was very magnetizing.
So I'm thrilled that you joined me, Bea, and I will hand it over to you to do a quick introduction.

Bea Lozinski:
Thank you, Christine.
Hi everybody, my name is Bea Lozinski.
I'm Vice President of Talent and Total Rewards at Magna.
I've been here five years, but prior to Magna, I actually came from the mining industry.
I was in the mining industry for 15 years and prior to that, I spent a tour in the software industry.
So I am very fortunate over the course of my career that I've had some wonderful leaders that I've worked for and worked with that have made a significant impression on me and my career.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
It's so fun to have you here.
So I'm gonna dive into our famous question.
When you look back, I mean, you've covered now automotive mining software.
That's a pretty big reach.
When you think back to the leaders that you'd call maybe your best bosses ever, just tell us a bit about who they are and why you would call them that

Bea Lozinski:
You know, like I said, I'm fortunate.
So it kind of, you have this flash of all these different faces coming up, but it may be the best way for me to start is when I think of the people that I've had exposure to or worked for, there was things specifically that really stood out for me about them.
And I think impressed me and engaged me.
First and foremost, I think they were very good at engaging their employees and galvanizing them to drive business strategies, to create a work environment that would attract and retain the best people possible.
I think the second thing is they were very good at driving results.
And I think that was very influential for me because I remember, you know, as I started out my career, I was probably a little less focused and more exploratory than I am these days.
So it was great to watch people in action and how they actually drove results for company.
The third thing I would say is they were really good at making decisions in a timely manner.
You know, I think one of the things people find really frustrating with leaders is that there's too much, you know, oh, we've got to, which is frustrating because you've got a bunch of people sitting there waiting to figure out what are we supposed to do?
You know, how do we make the business better?
So that's probably the third area.
And then I think most importantly, and this is probably still rings true today, is the ones who really focus on innovation and stretching the way you think and the way you look at the world.
And so when you ask me, well, you know, does anyone stand out for you?
Yeah, there's one person that stands out for me.
I think he stands out for all the people that work for him because we're all still, you know, fairly tight-knit community.
But I worked back in the 90s, I worked for a small software startup.
It was a Dutch-based company and it was owned by two brothers.
And he was such an, the CEO, his name's Jan Van, he was such an inspiring individual.
I mean, this was a gentleman who worked for years in the construction industry.
And when his company went south, all he had left, he told us, was his mainframes.
So he decided to take advantage of keeping them and do something, you know, with software.
And it's interesting when he used to, like, storytell because it was amazing how he would sort of capture our imaginations and just, you know, engage us in his journey and was very, you know, I think focused on helping us figure out our journeys because of what he had been through.
So, I mean, that's a tall order for someone who's trying to run a company, build a startup, ramp us up really quickly.
But he did an outstanding job.
I think the other thing, when I think about him, that stands out, and I still keep in touch with him to this day when I see him post things on LinkedIn, one of the most authentic people I have ever met.
You know, he was very driven to be successful, but not at the expense of others.
I think he was one of these people that wanted to, you know, capture the hearts and minds of his employees and bring them along on the journey.
And I mean, you know, he always drove, you know, this motto that, you know, his success is our success, not just his, which I think everyone appreciated.
But one of the other things that I think everybody loved about him are the culture we had in that organization.
I can honestly say I've never experienced since then.
And we had a motto or there's sort of the three values that drove everything that we did in that organization.
First one being taking initiative.
Second was operating with integrity.
And the third was innovation, which was the three like innovate, innovate, innovate.
And I remember one time being in his office, you know, fairly, I think that was only there a couple of years, and we were sort of growing the market in North America.
And I remember he called me and he said, you know, you're doing a good job, got like really good feedback on the projects that you've been working on, because I was the project manager at the time.
So I said, well, I'm really glad.
And I was so eager because, you know, my mind was like, well, you know, I know this business is coming up.
I wouldn't mind being the project manager on that.
And here's what I think I'd like to do.
And, you know, he was like, okay, B, you got to slow down.
He said, I want you to do a great job.
He goes, but that's not the reason that I wanted to talk to you.
And I'm thinking to myself, okay, what did you want to talk to me about?
So he asked me, he goes, what do you think is your biggest value to our organization?
And I was thinking in terms of, oh, it's my technical knowledge, it's my ability to deliver projects.
And he said to me, no, he goes, your biggest value to the company is your ability to dream and innovate.
He goes, because you're seeing things out there.
He goes that we who are in offices are never going to be able to see.
He goes, so I want to absorb as much as I can from you, you know, and understand sort of what you're seeing and what your perspective is, because that will help us with, you know, future plans for software.
And I was actually so surprised because I thought, geez, you know, I didn't even think you cared about what I thought.
I was more like, I just thought you cared about my delivering projects and making sure that I did them within scope, schedule, and budget.
But he was very, very unique that way.
And I mean, you know, they, the other thing, talk about developing people.
When I worked for that organization, I worked on some of the largest client base that they had, which I think for him was somewhat taking a bit of a risk, because it wasn't like I was an expert in the software industry, but I had good common sense and I had some pretty good business skills because of the jobs I'd done prior to getting into this industry.
But, you know, he was so focused on making sure we were getting, you know, development opportunities and moving through the ranks.
And at one point, he actually appointed a female CEO, which was a big turning point for the company.
But, you know, when I look back, I started with that organization.
I was employee number six, you know, by the time, yeah, and it was three, under three million in revenue.
And by the time I left, it was, you know, I was there like eight years.
I probably would have stayed there the rest of my life if things hadn't changed for the company.
But, you know, it was like, what, eight years, almost a billion dollars in revenue, which was quite a bit back in that, yeah, for how fast it happened.
It's a big company.
Yeah, well, Ian, you know what the thing is, we IPO'd the company in, what, three years.
I mean, just having all those experiences, like, you know, at that stage in my career, and in such a short time, you normally don't get that type of exposure of someone, you know, who's gonna sort of take an interest in his employees.
And it's true.
When the company's small, you get to do that.
As a company gets larger, it's a little bit more difficult.
But I think the thing that's important is, you know, you have to stay focused on, you know, developing your people, engaging your people, and I would say, you know, foremost, making sure that you have a culture that, you know, retains them and they wanna be a part of.

Christine Laperriere:
I love this example, though.
I mean, I'm thinking about the CEO that you worked for, and you were talking about, you know, innovation.
Tell me, what does it look like when you work for a company that, I mean, I hear, first of all, I absolutely loved the conversation that he had with you about what's your real value.
Like, what a mind shift right there, right?
For you personally thinking, what is my value here, right?
But then also, like, tell me more, like, what does it look like when you're working for a company that is able to really harness innovation as a cultural priority?


Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, well, I think back then, I would have said one of the things that was very interesting to me about how they went about doing this.
I mean, we had hierarchies in terms of operating, you know, how we ran the business.
But when it came to solving problems or thinking about the next wave of what we were gonna put in our software, the organization was extremely flat, like, and very networked.
So, you know, and we got so good at self-organizing, which is fascinating that this was in the 90s.
Yeah, because you just worked with people that loved working together.
And so, you know, if there was an issue about, well, we're thinking about doing this for this industry, because we started to split our software into industry solutions.
I mean, everyone knew, okay, go talk to her.
You know, this person about product design, go talk about this, go get this person.
He'll get you, you know, sort of product marketing intel to do this.
Talk to these people about, who've done the implementation work and have seen, you know, the pain out there.
Bring this team all together.
And so we'd have like these, you know, visioning sessions where you'd come in and it's, and you know, here's the business issue that we're trying to resolve.
You know, these are some of the key challenges.
What do we need to do together, you know, to figure out how we're gonna solve this?
So it wasn't just, you know, software developers and product people.
It was like an array of people from, you know, like a good cross section of the organization.
And, you know, I mean, although I think we had like a methodology for how we would do this, the innovation was in the fact that, you know, when people shared ideas, there was no judgment, no criticism.
Like nothing was, you know, taboo.
Yeah, everybody really appreciated everybody's input.
And I think even when the ideas were far out, you know, rather than someone telling you, but stupid and making you feel bad.
We all kind of, you know, poke fun at ourselves and people would laugh.
It would be like, yeah, I guess that is kind of, you know, probably not gonna work.
Okay, move on, let's go, you know.
And that was interesting was that when we got to the end of making a decision or a recommendation about something, you know, everyone stacked hands on the document and it would be, okay, if it fails, we're all taking accountability.
If it, you know, winds up lending well and we're gonna proceed, then it's shared, you know, recognition and reward, which I think is, you know, part of the, I would say the roots of what made that company so great.
You know, people just knew how to work together and how to kind of push forward.
But I mean, I don't, I can't remember in my work history that I ever had fun to the degree that I did when I was working there.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And what I'm hearing too, it's just interesting when you're talking about the organization being flat, I just hear kind of the evaporation of silos.

Bea Lozinski:
Oh yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Like, which is really actually one of the biggest challenges in the world of innovation is like we throw things back and forth over the wall, which really isn't innovation.

Bea Lozinski:
No, no, that's more, I would say that sounds a little bit more like strategic execution sometimes, you know, cause you're kind of passing the baton.
In this case, it's almost like baking a cake where everyone's throwing in the ingredients and stirring the batter together.
Yeah, it makes a big difference.
But you know, the funny part is when I think back, I mean, I worked with a team probably of in North America, I would say my inner team was probably, my network was probably a couple of hundred people that I used to interface with regularly.
And I haven't worked for that company in over 20 years.
I would say our network and our sort of appreciation for each other is as strong today as it was back then when we were working together, we all keep in touch.
They're a group of people that I can honestly say if I have a business issue or a challenge that I haven't had before, because I know what many of them are doing, I can easily pick up the phone and say, hey, I have a problem, can you help me out with this?
And everybody does.
And I don't know too many companies that leave that kind of a mark on you professionally as well as personally.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, I think that's pretty special actually to say, you know, this is like a family that you still keep in touch with, right?

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's a family, it's part of your network.
I think it's interesting because a lot of the people I've worked with have since retired and some are doing freelance work.
But, you know, it's interesting when we get together, when we start talking about sort of some of the challenges that we deal with professionally now, like we automatically still go into brainstorming mode in terms of, you know, well, how would you handle that?
Oh geez, have you seen that before?
Like, what do you think, you know?
And it's just a really nice network of people to have in your environment professionally.

Christine Laperriere:
So how did the organization get that, you know, how did you guys learn that?
Like, was that happening between those two brothers that were at the top of the organization?
Who led that?

Bea Lozinski:
Well, I- Because you were young, right?

Christine Laperriere:
How did you know to do that?

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, well, I was, yeah, I mean, based on where I am today, yes, I was young.

Christine Laperriere:
It's okay.

Bea Lozinski:
It's okay.
It was 20 years ago.
For those of you that can't see us- 20 years younger than you are today.
Yes, exactly, of course.
No, it was, I think they led by example.
I think they demonstrated the behaviors.
And I would say in the early days, they were very much engaged with, you know, showing us and talking to us about how they wanted the company to operate.
They had a very low tolerance policy for, I'll call it, you know, bad behavior or people that didn't align with the values of the company.
I mean, in a company like that, you wouldn't have lasted long.
You probably would have self-selected before they would fire you.
They would never have that kind of company.
But yeah, they did a really good job.
I can remember, you know, we'd have team meetings and he did this too at a lot of the industry presentations he used to do.
You could tell his passion by the way he talked.
So, I mean, you know, that engaged you to begin with.
But I can remember where he'd be showing, you know, different parts of the software on the screen and he would take this pen and start writing on the software.
And I'm like going, geez, I'm pretty good with technology.
So are half of us.
And we're all kind of leaning over, you know, there's a row of chairs and we're sitting and watching him in action and going, oh my God, like, look, like, you know, he's talking, he's writing.
He's like so passionate about what he's doing.
But that was what he brought to the table and I think taught us all how to do.
It's like, where's your passion?
You know, let's talk about where we wanna be taking this product.
Gave all of us a voice.
Never once did I ever hear him say, oh, that's stupid or that's a bad idea.
Nothing, like none of that, you know?
It was just really inspiring and empowering I think are the two words I would probably use.

Christine Laperriere:
Nice.
So I always love to ask, what's the business impact of having a best boss?
Because obviously in my world, I'm always being challenged with if I spend money on my leaders, what's the return on investment?
So I'm curious, could, I mean, I heard that they grew phenomenally in that eight years.

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, I would say the big one is you will find people will galvanize and really push themselves to do their best for the organization.
Cause they know if they do their best for the organization, that's probably gonna mean good things for them.
You know, whether it's, you know, compensatory, whether it's, you know, professionally, moving your career through the ranks.
Like I started, as I said, when I started with them, I was doing training and project management.
You know, I wound up being the VP of consulting by the time I was finished my tour there, you know, I'd spent time in Europe.
I lived in the Netherlands for a couple of years.
Like it was just a phenomenal experience.
So I would say, you know, when you talk about the return, probably three things, you know, from results and performance, our revenue, we had exponential growth very, very quickly, you know, which allowed us to IPO in three years, which is fairly fast for an IPO.
The second thing I would say is our turnover was very low and we had a very strong employer brand.
And you know, at that, back in that day, we were sort of one, it was like, you know, SAP, Oracle and Bond were the three sort of big enterprise players.
And we never had problems attracting people.
We never had, we had very low turnover for the most part, but we always had good leaders.
Like, I mean, I even found, you know, when Jan sort of stepped aside and wasn't the CEO, he brought on in this woman, Amal Johnson, similar characteristics, very well accomplished, extremely good leadership skills.
Like, she was pretty amazing.
I mean, you can imagine, like back then, you know, nobody talked about, you know, diversity and inclusion.
It would have been, yeah, early to the table.
Exactly, to bring a woman CEO in, but she was so well liked and respected.
Everybody just thought the world of her and, you know, everybody gave it, you know, their best and it showed.
So I think that was the second thing that I would say.
And then I would say generally, the leadership brand of that company, like permeated down, you know, so everybody knew this is what was expected.
And I can remember, you know, when I went to Europe, they actually asked me to be part of starting up a business IT school.
Cause back then, you know, software was taking off, but the availability of people to actually, you know, consult and support this stuff was quite low.
So we opened up this sort of Academy in Europe and this beautiful like castle or chateau thing in the Netherlands.
It was great.
Oh yeah, yeah.
It was really quite interesting.
And so we'd bring people over for a 10 week accelerator program so that they could go out where they learned the product, also learned some really good consulting skills and then go back out, whether it was, you know, our company or a partner of our company and go and do the consulting.
And I remember when I was actually facilitating some of the stuff and I kind of did the overall coordination for selecting the people to come in and I used to facilitate that.
And every time people left the program, you know, the one impression that was always made upon them was just how fantastic all the leaders were, you know, that they actually cared about their progress, that they actually cared about, you know, where they were gonna work and help facilitate, you know, a smooth transition and that they were great like teachers.
But, you know, we were, you know, back in those days, like, you know, you'd do your job during the day and when you had a program like this, you'd spend as much time as you could outside of work socializing with these people to kind of get to know who they are, get to know, you know, their backgrounds and their stories because in that organization, you know, it was felt as being a beneficial thing for helping them figure out, you know, sort of their path through the company.
Those are, you know, some of the things that I would say for me from a, and you know, there's like quantitative and qualitative, but at the end of the day, you know, the numbers will only happen if the other things, you know, are there as a foundation to make the company successful.
Actually, I don't think that's changed over all the different jobs that I've had.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's consistent across the board.

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, it is, it is.
And you see it in a lot of companies.
I mean, I've worked for some companies where, you know, we had great leadership and then there was a change at the top because the board decided that's what they wanted.
And the pendulum shift was, I think, more than the company could handle.
And so you'd start to see, you know, people turning over like self-select believing, and then you start to see, you know, the trickle-down effect of that, you know?
And so I think for most leaders, you know, coming into those types of senior roles now, you know, you need to be, I mean, you have to sort of change your leadership style far more than, you know, you had to in the past, I'd say.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Bea Lozinski:
And I don't know, I'm not always sure that I think people understand that.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, no, it's a big, it's a moving target right now.
We have a lot of, these generations have very different upbringings and expectations.
And, you know, again, it's a massive time of change, right?

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, well, I think, you know, I mean, when I look at sort of some of the challenges I'm dealing with now, because, you know, I've had, honestly, I've had quite a few people exit the organization, you know, they're looking for something different, you know, and I think, you know, given the fact that everyone's working remote now, and I mean, there's some, for automotive, there's some big challenges in terms of, you know, competing with some of these other companies.
But, you know, when you kind of listen to what people say at the end of the day, you know, whether it's this industry or any other industry, because I read the research, I'm sure like you do and many others do, you know, I think we're coming back to this world where, you know, employees really want to align with the values of the company, work for a culture that appreciates them and makes them feel like they're valued, you know, not just remains to an end.
I think, you know, they wanna have a voice and know that their voice is being heard and that they have input in terms of whatever their span of control is.
This is not a generation that's like, you know, tell me what the task is and I'll get it done.
This is a generation who really wants to understand why am I doing this?
What value does it add?
And then I'll tell you whether I wanna do it or not.
You know, so it's been an interesting shift from that perspective.
But yeah, these things are, I think, a big challenge for leaders nowadays.

Christine Laperriere:
Last question for you, maybe second to last, we'll see how we do on time.
But when you think of things, not maybe your worst boss ever, but what you would say is a criteria or something that you could see just repelled people and really didn't work, right?
Like in your career, I mean, you've been obviously into so many different industries.
If you had to nail down one or two things that you know are probably the worst boss ever traits, what would you say?

Bea Lozinski:
I haven't had too many.
I've had a couple that probably stand out for me.
One earlier in my career and one later on, let's say, I wouldn't say quite midpoint, but you know, a little bit later on.
And I think there's two things that they had in common that for me just, I would say disappointing and to some degree, you know, even devastating, especially when you're younger in your career.
But I would say those that sort of had their own agenda, I think in some cases, the ones that are demoralizing and treat people in a way that's inappropriate.
I mean, I've always believed, if you want people to treat you well, how you treat them is gonna be a reflection of what they're gonna do for you and how they're gonna treat you.
And I think in both the instances that I mentioned, I would say these two individuals didn't really care what their employees thought of them, didn't really care how they felt.
It was more about like getting the job done and you know, how do I maneuver my way through this organization?
You know, what do I need to get accomplished in order to move ahead?
And I would say they had their own interests ahead of the people that work for them, which I don't think you can do and be successful.
So yeah, those are probably qualities that I would say, you know, I would stay away from.

Christine Laperriere:
After you left that company, what happened?

Bea Lozinski:
So, you know, it was really tough because, you know, I spent eight, nine years working for, you know, a set of leaders that operated in a certain way.
And then I came out and the next job I took, you know, I had a bar, an expectation of the leaders that was so high based on what I experienced.
And the most of the people that were leading, their bar was much lower.
And for me, that was such a shock and such an adjustment because it was like, okay, I either have to meet them halfway and can I deal with that?
Like, can I not get frustrated?
Can I learn to accept those leaders for who they are?
And I think I tried, but you know, I was always one of these people, you know, that pushed, it's like, if you want 150% from me, then I should at least be able to expect 100 or 110% from you.
And I think for some, it was a real stretch.
And because I'm pretty tenacious, I think some people used to get really frustrated, you know, and others were like, yeah, you know, I didn't like when you were like that, but you know, it actually wasn't a bad thing for me.
So, you know, it's tough, like when you start to realize those things, because it's then, you know, how do you pivot?
And you don't wanna be just hopping from job to job because that's not gonna be good for you professionally long-term.
But yeah, it was a challenge, I will say.

Christine Laperriere:
I think having a high bar in leadership is, it's a good thing, but it sounds like it also poses a bit of a problem at times.

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, I mean, you know, I think over time, I started to learn to lower my bar.
And I think what most of us figured out was that we probably won't experience something like that again.
You know, but the good thing was we all had each other to sort of pick up the phone and say, okay, how do you handle this?
You know, cause some of the people that I knew and worked with, I would say they were probably back then a little more politically savvier than I was.
So it was good to have them as mentors, you know, to lean on to help me sort of weather that.
And look, you know, I think when you start your career and you're growing your career, would I say I was the world's best leader all the time?
Yeah, you know, it's people do experience that stuff and it's very real and it definitely impacts their ability to perform.
Dust yourself off and get back on the horse.
But I think, you know, when I look at the people I've been, I've influenced most heavily and how successful they've become, I'm like, okay, I must've got it right somewhere along the way.
Because normally when people ask me to describe myself when I'm interviewing them, I tell them all the time, yeah, I think if you talk to most people that work for me, they tell you I'm tough, but I'm fair.
And that I do care about people in general.
But you know, I think I sort of followed that approach because what I started to realize was most of the people that worked for me as years passed, they actually were really successful.
Some even exceeded, you know, my level of success, which I'm really proud of because I'm happy for.
You know, and to me that's a mark of, you know, how well did I do when you talk about metrics, you know, how do you metric your own leadership like results?
And so it's not just what you do for the companies that you work for, but it's those people that worked for you and really, you know, gave it their all did they get the right return?
And I would like to think in most cases, the people that worked for me that I invested in and they invested in me, yeah, they've done really well.
So it's a good thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, yeah.
And it is, that's a great metric of, you know, the impact that you're making, you know, above and beyond the results, right?
To me that's, and even if you get out of bed one day and you have to reflect on your career and like, you know, did you matter?
I feel like you mattered to all those people.

Bea Lozinski:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.
And I think, you know, if you're not thinking like that, then I would say, I don't know, maybe you'll miss out something in life, you know, that will be billing for you.
Cause I know when I decide, you know, I'm done professionally, I'm not gonna look at all the numbers and the things that I did and how many projects that got successful and you know, how much service right over you did I generate or, you know, how much trading dollars did I save a company or any of that?
I mean, that's all great stuff, but it's a snapshot in time.
The thing that endures and that's over the whole course of your career is, you know, the people that you impacted, did you leave a leadership legacy to be proud of?
Do people, have their lives been better or enriched or have their careers been better enriched by working for you or having a relationship with you?
That to me is I think more important than the other stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I think that is a perfect close.
So I'm gonna just say thank you so much.
That was a fantastic interview.
I'm very sure you've made that impact.
I can tell just seeing people around you.
So like I said, this was fantastic and we're so glad that you came out and shared your story today.

Bea Lozinski:
Thanks very much for having me, Christine.
I appreciate it.

Episode: 29
Title: Pretend you have done this 100 times
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Omnia Helba

Christine Laperriere:
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and with me today, I have Omnia Helba.
Thank you, Omnia, for joining me.

Omnia Helba:
Thanks for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
So really quick, before we get started, just give a 30-second introduction, Omnia, so everybody knows who you are.

Omnia Helba:
Sure.
My name is Omnia Helba, and I have worked in talent and organizational development for the last approximately 15 years.
I'm currently with the Ministry of Attorney General and leading a high-performing team focused on all things people-centered.

Christine Laperriere:
And I was so glad to invite you onto the show because we had the opportunity to work together on diversity, inclusion, and equity at Sobeys.
And so we actually got a chance to do some great work there together.
And I genuinely enjoyed working with you.
So it was great to reach out and invite you onto the show.
Thank you.
I'm going to just dive in.
Who is your best boss ever and why?
Tell us.

Omnia Helba:
OK, so I'm going to tackle this one a little bit differently.
Christine, because I've had a lot of really great bosses and I have to really talk about what the theme has been throughout my entire career.
And I'll say that the best bosses I've had have just had this unwavering trust in me and in my ability before I did, truthfully.
So they're the ones who really saw my potential and trusted me to bring it out.
Early on in my career, quite frankly, I probably wasn't actually that confident.
So when I think about my very first real job opportunity after completing my master's, it was at the YWCA with a great woman named Denise Doyle, who just loves to empower women.
And I was so nervous, I'd never facilitated anything before.
And I was about to facilitate something to the leadership team.
And she said to me, you know what, Omnia, you've never done this before.
She said, I know that and you know that, but no one else knows that.
And she was like, so just go out there and pretend you've done this a hundred times.
And it's exactly what I did.
And nobody could tell.
And it was just it was so empowering.
Like it was just in, you know, you're fresh out of school, 23 years old.
And it was just such an awesome experience.
And that's been the theme throughout my career.
And I would say, like, I'm happy to share more examples.
But I would say that that was kind of the the first opportunity I had to see what it was like to really have a great boss.

Christine Laperriere:
So what did that do for your confidence?

Omnia Helba:
It skyrocketed like Christine.
She that's what I was saying.
She believed in me before I believed in myself.
And I just think that that to me spoke volumes about the impact a leader can have on their employee.
You really are in a position where you can make your employee feel that, you know, sky's the limit.
They've got all this potential.
Or she could have turned around and said, OK, maybe you're not ready for this yet.
Let me do this.
Right.
And I've seen bosses do that as well.
And just by choosing that approach to take the risk on me.
And I mean, it was obviously a minor risk, but, you know, she took the risk.
She said, it's fine.
Worst case scenario, you mess this up.
It's OK.
Nothing.
You know, the world's not going to end.
And it did.
It really helped to boost my confidence, for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Omnia Helba:
And she gave you all that power at 23 years old.

Christine Laperriere:
She did.

Omnia Helba:
She saw something I didn't, clearly.
But I'm so grateful to her for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Omnia Helba:
And then so you said there's a theme and there's numerous bosses that have done similar things.
So tell me more about those.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Omnia Helba:
So when I went over to Walmart, I had a boss named Stephanie Hardman.
And she was over.
She's over at McDonald's now leading their HR function.
And we went into it.
We were going into a meeting.
I was going to present employee engagement results to the chief operating officer.
My understanding is that she would present it.
I'd be there in case he had questions.
Again, not very senior in my career.
And we're sitting outside his office and she turns to me and she says, you know what, Amia, you've got this.
And I stopped.
I was like, got what?
She was like, you have this.
She's like, you're going to present this and I'll be there in case you need me.
And at this point, I'm obviously so nervous.
I barely had any meetings with this individual.
We walk in and I presented it.
It went extremely well.
You know, and she was just she was literally just sitting there in case I needed her.
And again, she trusted me before I trusted myself.
And it just it helped me go into that meeting with full confidence that I could do it.
And after that, I mean, I could present in front of anyone at any time and never be nervous again.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
Because the stakes were so high.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's great because and I'll even just share personally, when I get really nervous and I'm going in front of a big group or I'm going to a big meeting, I use the mantra, you've got this.
I don't know where I got it from.
Somebody said it one time and I thought, what a great confidence boosting mantra.
And so sometimes I'll feel myself.
I'm like, my palms are sweaty and I feel kind of sick to my stomach because I'm getting ready to do, you know, a big speech or I'm getting ready to kick off a big program.
And I'll just keep telling myself, listen, you got this.
Like, this is not, you know, this is not the last day of your career.
As we know it.

Omnia Helba:
Right.
It's like we got this.
You know, I mean, those are the stories we tell ourselves.
Right.
And when you have a boss that's helping you realize those stories that you tell yourself about your own ability, I mean, that's life changing.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And somebody's validating that to you, which is so powerful.
And they're putting that faith in you.
OK, so those are good ones.
Keep going.
What else do you have?

Omnia Helba:
Yeah.
Well, let me share one you actually know.
So Heather de Blas over at Sobey's, by far one of my favorite bosses, like just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader.
You know, when I started with her, we were kind of building equity, diversity, inclusion from the ground up at Sobey's.
It was, you know, brand new function.
It wasn't side of desk.
It was an actual team.
She gave me full creative power.
You know, she said, you know, help me design this from start to finish.
I told her I really love strategy.
She said, great, let me get you involved in the strategy, building of a strategy, said, you know, I really love facilitation.
She said, great, I'm going to put you right in there with facilitation and facilitating sessions.
I really love working with women.
Great.
We're going to build, you know, the first women's employee resource group for Sobey's and you can lead that work.
And so she really said I could design my dream job.
She really gave me full bandwidth to do exactly what I wanted to do.
And she believed that I could do it again.
It was just that trust that I told her I like to do something.
I told her I was good at it and she just trusted me.
She said, great, let's do it without making me second guess myself.
And just, you know, I think that, again, just brings out so much out of an employee where they feel like, you know what, I can go to work every day, I can feel confident, I can feel happy and I can do what I want to do.
Right.
And it's rare.
It's rare to find bosses like that.
I've been fortunate that I've had, you know, a few of them.
But those, I would say, are probably the ones that are the highlights of my career.
Excellent.
And I just hear this reoccurring theme, like you said, this unwavering trust for people extending the trust before you knew for sure you could do it or before you were proven yet.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.
You know, I really I think that's important because that's a different flavor to trust.
That's not just I trust you can get the job done.
All right.
You know what I mean?
It's not just I know you're not going to, you know, throw me under the bus.
That's a different type of trust.
It's almost like I'm going to I'm going to throw you enough rope that I'm, you know, and I know you're going to succeed.
I'm going to help you swim.

Omnia Helba:
No, it's true.
And you know what, Christine, as a woman in hijab, I mean, I'm I'm very visibly different.
Right.
And it's not often that individuals from marginalized communities find sponsors in their career, especially so early on.
Right.
It's like so many individuals that I know have had to prove themselves time and time and time and time again before they're finally given opportunity.
And I would say that, you know, I'm fortunate.
It's definitely a privilege of mine that I haven't had to experience that multiple times in my career.
But these individuals knew they knew I was up against something different and they really wanted to make sure I was successful.
And just by being there and being so supportive, you know, it helped remove a lot of roadblocks for me.
Right.
They gave me that executive access.
They gave me the sponsorship.
They spoke highly of me behind closed doors and rooms where there was likely no one who looked like me.
And that was really powerful as well.

Christine Laperriere:
What is it like to work for these large organizations and probably not see a lot of people that look like you?

Omnia Helba:
You know, I would say early on in my career, it probably bothered me a little bit more.
You know, not seeing myself reflected in leadership was certainly a bit of a glass ceiling, like more than a glass ceiling.
You just couldn't see myself ever getting there.
You know, and I wanted to get there.
Like I was driven from my first job that I wanted to one day just be a really, you know, senior executive and not seeing that was definitely a flag to me to say, probably not going to get there.
Right.
That's kind of the message that was being sent to me.
I would say as I kind of grew more in myself and in my own confidence and my own capabilities, I stopped relying on that mindset.
I shifted towards, well, you know what?
I'll just be the first.
I'll be the first and I'll pave the way for others.
Right.
And I'm not the first.
And I'm so thankful now that there are more people who look like me in leadership.
And I'm so happy that that, you know, that's not going to be hopefully the same experience for others.
But, you know, for me, it was it was a shift to just say, OK, well, I'm going to have to make it through.
And again, if I didn't have those bosses, I didn't have those, you know, fantastic leaders.
I don't think I would have ever gotten to a point where I said, OK, I'll be the first.
Right.
Like they gave me that confidence, truthfully.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
That's powerful.
When you reach those senior executive levels, what are some of the things that you'll advocate for to make sure that people like you coming into an organization feel valued and acknowledged like what would be some of the things that you can think of given your experience?

Omnia Helba:
So there's a few challenges.
That's a kind of a bit of a, you know, peel the onion kind of question because there's lots of layers involved.
So one, I think just even that redistribution of power and having individuals who are marginalized in those senior leadership positions already does something without actually having to act.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
So that's the first step, I think, is representation and that shift of power to individuals.
I think for me, and it's something I've always done throughout my career.
Anyway, it's also about giving people opportunity, right?
Opening the doors for them, seeing the roadblocks and removing them for individuals, extending the hand sponsorship.
Sponsorship is so huge, Christine, like I can't even emphasize how much more powerful it is even than mentorship.
Mentorship is great for a personal development piece, but that sponsorship to get people up the corporate ladder is just something else.
You know, and we want to pretend it doesn't exist.
We want to pretend that it only, you know, people move up just based on merit.
But the reality is, if people don't know who you are, you're probably not going to get that opportunity.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
So that's a big one as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
And then, of course, the mentorship, we've just launched a mentorship program where I am now for Black, Indigenous and racialized individuals in their career.
And more than just career coaching, it's also about that shared experience, like, you know, hearing from leaders how they got through some challenges.
And I just think that that has been powerful.
I'm mentoring someone now.
And, you know, she hasn't come to me a whole lot with, you know, your typical career questions, but more so of those challenges that she's facing and trying to get through.
And, you know, that's I think that's very enriching as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
Thank you so much for letting me pick your brain on that.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah, of course.

Christine Laperriere:
And so I'm going to ask you one more question.
I know you had a child during COVID.
And so now you have a very large family of four children.
Tell me a little bit about what it is like to be a woman with such a large family, also trying to navigate a career.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah, it's tough.
Well, you know, add COVID and kids being home and online schooling and all of that fun stuff and getting home sent home for two weeks at a time.
It's been extremely difficult, Christine.
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
It's probably been two of the hardest years of my life.
I also did start a new job with another fantastic boss, Naila Ibrahim.
And her support has been just incredible in terms of that flexibility to say, listen, I need to do pick up today for the kids.
I'm going to be offline from this time to this time.
You know, this kid's got a doctor's appointment.
I've got to go and I'll be back.
Right.
And just I think that recognition of being human.
And I think that's something we all need to do for one another right now is just recognize we're all just human and struggling is huge.
You know, as a woman as well, I would say for me, my husband and I are really good partners.
He's just, you know, he takes on a lot of load, a lot of the caregiver load.
And I was reflecting on that earlier today.
And I thought, you know, as a child growing up, my mom played, I would say, 100 percent role of a caregiver.
Right.
And my kids are growing up very differently.
My husband cooks, we share responsibility, we, you know, have to outsource some things.
And so they actually see us kind of as a split caregivers for them.
And I think that's helped quite a bit.
If I didn't have a partner who was so supportive, I don't know that I would have I would have been able to have such a large family and it's something we both wanted.
So, yeah, I think it's that that partnership has been really important.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And I mean, from a to me, that's that speaks a lot about just the shifting perception of, you know, how we split responsibility.
You're able to have this great career.
And, you know, like you said, you're in a true partnership.
So that's fantastic.
And then I also think when you see organizations with, again, more moms and dads in the organization, I think it's it's where you start to see leadership, make those decisions to be flexible and supportive and understand that that's that's an important part of enabling somebody to be successful right now.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah.
And I think COVID, I mean, with all of its negativity, the one thing it's done is it's I mean, it's brought our personal lives into our work lives, right?
And we now have integration between the two.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, yeah, before.
Right.

Omnia Helba:
And now I'm not shy to tell someone, I'm sorry.
I don't I can't meet with you at that time.
I have to do pick up or I'm sorry.
I have to do drop off.
Whereas before, I probably would have been a little more hesitant to do that and would have, you know, just said, I'm sorry.
I have a conflict without openly sharing exactly why I can't make it at that time and in meetings with senior leaders.
And they're on the phone and we're going to go pick up my kid from school or I have to walk my dog at lunch or, you know, and I think it's changed, changed the culture quite a bit in organizations.
Excellent.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely.
So I'm just going to circle back to one or two more questions on the best boss.
So, you know, we talked about trust, and I appreciate this added element of flexibility in there.
You know, organizations are always asking why should they invest in creating best bosses, right?
Why why put dollars and cents against it?
And I mean, you know, from DEI initiatives, right?
Those are all costly initiatives, right?
So if you could identify what's the impact on the business.
I mean, I know this isn't an easy question, but in your experience, what have you seen as the impact on the business when you have great leadership?

Omnia Helba:
Well, definitely we see engagement levels rise, right?
And we know that engagement leads to productivity and people are more invested in their work.
You're able to get a little bit more of that discretionary effort.
So, you know, you're paying them nine to five, but if something needs to get done and they're highly engaged, they're going to work a little bit extra to get it done.
Right.
So that that I think has a deep dollar value associated with it.
We also see less absenteeism, lower turnover.
Like those are all things that that we've seen studies that demonstrate having a highly engaged workforce will impact.
So, you know, they're not necessarily you're not going to have exact dollar to dollar.
But I think when you have a highly engaged workforce with good bosses and good leadership, you're going to see a lot more productivity.
And that's, I think, the bottom line for a lot of organizations.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
I agree completely.
And so my last question for you is, have you ever had a not so great boss?
You don't have to name them or shame them.
But, you know, what was the impact on that like for you?
Like, what was the impact of their leadership on you and what were some of the things that you could identify that were not great practices?

Omnia Helba:
Yeah, you know, I've been fortunate.
I only have one boss that I didn't enjoy working for.
She just had the complete opposite of my other bosses in terms of lack of flexibility.
This individual experienced what I think was hardship early in their career.
And they didn't extend the olive branch and make it easier on the next person.
They, in fact, made it more difficult by, you know, for example, when I would come in 15 minutes late to work because my kid was sick and I had to do drop off and all these sort of things.
The expectation is I would stay 15 minutes behind, right, to make up for those 15 minutes.
And it was just that micromanagement.
And it really took away any motivation.
I had to do anything above and extra like above and beyond.
And I was fortunate to recognize that that wasn't a workforce that I wanted to be in.
And I left very quickly.
But I know a lot of people don't have the opportunity to leave and go somewhere else.
And they're stuck in situations for me.
It really demonstrated for me what I didn't want to do with my teams.
Right.
And so now when I lead, I think about the whole person.
I think about, you know, what else they have going on in their lives.
And people are going to have good days and bad days.
And they're going to have things that happen in their personal lives that we have to accommodate for.
And it really demonstrated to me what I didn't want.
And so I think it was good.
I think it was good for me to go through it because it made me really appreciate the good passes that I had after.
And I think it also made me a stronger leader because I am so careful not to do what was done to me.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that's a great answer.
And I hear that a lot.
It's the micromanagement.
It's, you know, to me, focusing on how many minutes you're in the office is just so irrelevant to real productivity and engagement and accomplishment.
You know, like we're not in the industrial age where you're, you know, if you're putting parts on a car, for example, then those 15 minutes matter.
Right.
But if you're.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah.
And I think also just the recognition that people are like, there are times, right, there are times where leaders do need to micromanage more than they want to because individuals simply aren't performing.
And that does happen.
Right.
That should be the exception to the rule and not your main.
That shouldn't be the rule that you apply to everyone.
It should be almost a last resort when you have to performance manage someone.
Unfortunately, I think leaders do the opposite.
They start with the assumption that, you know, employees need to do it.
And then they have to, you know, they have to earn their trust.
And I think that's just a really negative way to build a relationship.

Christine Laperriere:
Very backwards.
Excellent.
And then if you have any final tips, I mean, I have a fantastic audience of people who are out there trying to be excellent leaders.
So share any last words of wisdom or areas of focus that you would encourage people to really think about as they're trying to be their best boss.

Omnia Helba:
I think think about the whole person.
And, you know, we do a lot of this diversity and inclusion work right now.
And we tell people to bring their full selves to work, but then we don't treat them as a whole person.
So for those of us who want to be better leaders, I think we need to think in the context of what else is going on in their lives.
What else might they might they need support with?
What else can I do to facilitate them actually bringing their best selves to work and reaching their potential and also recognizing them?
You know, I didn't talk about that today, but recognition is huge.
And just, you know, it can be as minor as actually thanking your employees for a job well done, you know, but really giving them that recognition and ask them how they want to be recognized, how they prefer to be recognized.
And then I think even just those two things, if you're really focused on those two things, I think you'll have a stronger, more productive team.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
I appreciate it so much.
Again, thank you for your time today.

Omnia Helba:
Thanks so much, Christine.
This was great.Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast

Title: Having a seat at the table
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Stephanie Wolfe

Christine Laperriere:
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and this week I have on Stephanie Wolf.
So Steph, thank you for joining me, and I'm just going to say really quick, I invited you onto the show because, first of all, I have an incredible amount of admiration for the work that you're doing as a financial counselor for women in finance, but also that you have now joined BMO Private Wealth.
So your career, you also, you know, you worked at quite a few different financial institutions, and so your career has really, you've moved through a lot of different areas and organizations, and I think you're a great one to talk about this today.

Stephanie Wolfe:
Awesome.
Well, I'm very excited to be here, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
Anything you wanted to share with the group just as they're getting a chance to know you better?

Stephanie Wolfe:
So yes, as you noted, my career has taken many changes over the last few years.
I am a strategic business leader, entrepreneur, I'm a financial literacy advocate, and formal financial marketing executive.
So really, my passion is for empowering women to invest and really support them as they move through their careers.

Christine Laperriere:
That is why I am one of your biggest fans.
So thank you so much for joining me.
So we're just going to dive in.
I know you're going to answer this in a little bit of a unique way, but who is your best boss ever and why?

Stephanie Wolfe:
Very unique way to answer this because as I reflected on this question, I realized that there wasn't just one boss that I could touch on.
Over the course of my career, there was actually four that really stood out to me.
And the reason there's four is because different parts in my career, I was at different areas of growth.
So each of these leaders really took an opportunity to guide me and coach me in ways that I needed at that particular time in my career.
And so they all have added tremendous value and maybe I'm just lucky or one of the lucky few, but I think I've just had phenomenal leaders to support me on my journey.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
So this is perfect.
I mean, it's such a good topic that we're going to dive into today around how best bosses, you know, the type of coaching that they give you is very relevant at different ages and stages of your career.
And I think that's kind of an interesting insight that, you know, an aha moment that I'm having, having done so many of these interviews.
So can you walk us through those four different leaders and how they were different?
Take us back to the beginning of your career.

Stephanie Wolfe:
Oh, the very beginning, Linda Watson is her name.
And actually she just recently retired, phenomenal woman in consumer packaged goods led the way for revision as they launched their brand of eyewear around the world.
But Linda was really my first ever boss and she was, I like to call my confidence builder.
She was willing to sort of put me in the positions that I had never, never been in before and she trusted me.
So I remember the very first time actually we were going through a brand and marketing session.
It was my first time meeting with a big group, a big branding marketing group, and I was at the table and I was obviously the youngest one there.
I was probably three months into the job and, you know, they were presenting a very robust brand presentation to Linda and the CEO of this new company in that room.
I'll never forget.
She, she paused and she said, well, I think we haven't heard from everybody as they were getting feedback.
And she said, Stephanie, do you have anything else that you would like to add to this after the presentation was done?
And you know, that asking for my opinion at such a young age and, and ensuring that I had a seat at the table was something that stuck with me and something that I have actually carried forward when I've had younger team members working with me is to give them that confidence that they can speak and they can have a seat at that table and don't hold back.
You might be learning, but everything that you're adding is adding value.

Christine Laperriere:
That's incredible.
And it's such an important piece around inclusion, right?
She didn't decide that your age determined whether or not you were, you had something valid to add.
And I think that is powerful.
That's really demonstrating excellent, inclusive leadership in addition to being a great supporter of yours.

Stephanie Wolfe:
Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, I could have just sat at that table and, you know, stayed quiet and let it, let it pass through, but then I wouldn't have built that growth opportunity there to speak up and learn that I did have a seat at the table.
I was able to speak up.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's great.
I hear companies hire young kids out of school and they do that because they have this fresh perspective, but then they never asked for that perspective.
So I just appreciate that she was living, living that trait.
So that's excellent.
So after Linda, then what happened?

Stephanie Wolfe:
Well, that's when I transitioned into financial services.
So taking all of those amazing marketing skills that Linda instilled in me, honestly, I had such a great training background with her.
I moved on to Franklin Templeton Investments, where actually I reported to a man called Matthew Snair, Matt Snair, who is actually somebody to this day that I still keep in touch with.
He's fantastic mentor and somebody who I really respected.
You know, Matt, at the time was, and still to this day, he's somebody that I said was a heart centered leader before that term even existed.
And the reason I say that is because there was a particular moment where it had been a really rough week.
It was around the 2008 financial crisis.
Things had really imploded.
People were very emotional, but Matt took the time to speak to everybody on the team.
He put aside everything else just to make sure that we were comfortable.
And I said in this meeting with him, Matt, like, how do you, how do you do this, right?
Like how, how do you put others first like this?
He said, I do it because I care.
And those words stuck with me because it showed that just because you're in this working environment and he's a boss, people have emotions.
We're all human and we've all got challenges.
So he's, he's honestly somebody who showed me how to lead.
And I say this because he said that his job was always to take the stuff from the top and filter it out so that I could focus on my job and not worry.
And that was really important for me to hear as well.
So, I mean, I reported to Matt for several years and that was the biggest leadership skill that he instilled in me was that he was the buffer and his job was to make sure I had the emotional and mental capacity to do my job well.
That's such a good point.
His job is to take the stuff from the top, filter it out so that you don't have to worry and give you, you know, the most relevant information that you need to do the best job without taking, you know, taking on any new worry.
And I think that makes so much sense in 2008.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, it seemed like anybody working anywhere was filled with worry because nobody knew what was going to happen next.
So I can see why that must've felt stabilizing.

Stephanie Wolfe:
Very stabilizing.
That is the type of leader he is and still somebody who I see as rock solid, honestly, great, a great support over the years.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Okay.
Wow.
These are two really good ones.
So, okay, you have more?

Stephanie Wolfe:
I do.
I do.

Christine Laperriere:
You are lucky.

Stephanie Wolfe:
And I have been very blessed to have fantastic leaders.
So it's interesting too, because I was thinking there's one other common thread is that many of the environments that I was working in were very entrepreneurial based.
And I wonder if this may have been what gave me the tools that I needed when I launched my own business as well, right?
So, you know, honestly, you asking me this question is really allowed for a lot of reflection and to really think about why I am where I am today and who these leaders are and what they did for me.
So my next great boss ever was Rohit Mehta.
Now he was, I call him the visionary and he was great at challenging me.
And so I was probably more than mid-career at this point on track for my next role, which was executive level, you know, it was a very small company that I was working for with him and we had a very small budget and of course he was, he was a natural salesman.
I was a natural marketer.
And so, you know, he constantly challenged me to think bigger and push me outside of my comfort zone.
And so I loved it.
When I say he was a visionary, he really would, you know, continue.
He saw what I wanted to do, but as a great salesman, he knew what he wanted as well.
And so there was a constant compromise and a lot of learning that happened as I saw how to think bigger with a very smaller company and how, where, where they wanted to go and how could I help them get there in the non-traditional marketing way, right?
What could I add value to as a, as a marketer for this firm to get them to where they wanted to go, really bootstrapping our way there.
So it was a fantastic opportunity to work with Rohit.
He's really good at building businesses and he's a great salesman.
Tell me about that challenging part though.
Help me understand.
What does that look like?
Cause it doesn't sound fun when you say it.
So one of our biggest challenges was to actually communicate to investment advisors, the value of the products that we were offering.
So what I wanted to do was the traditional marketing group, you know, traditional marketing campaigns, but he challenged me to think a little bit more about how can we talk to them directly?
And so where we ended up landing was on a contest that they could participate in and the winner who participated in this would actually be able to have a donation of, I think it was something like $20,000 go to their charity of choice.
So it was something that I would say more Garula type marketing that was kind of from the ground up.
Uh, we really got in with the advisor community.
It was a very smart play and marketing tactic that was obviously not as cost prohibitive as some of the traditional marketing routes that I could have taken.
And so I really appreciated his input in challenging me to continue to think bigger and bigger and what can we do that hasn't been done that will get attention.
And so when I say visionary, he really showed me how entrepreneurs can go big, still make sure that you're within budget.
So I absolutely, I loved working with Rohit.
He was fantastic.
I know he's still doing great things to this day.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's great.
I mean, again, just to like how much growth comes out of saying, how do we do this in a non-traditional way and to challenge you to get creative and really come out of fresh new ways of thinking.

Stephanie Wolfe:
I think that sounds really like a really neat experience and you don't get asked for that as often in certain environments.
Like I don't hear a lot of leaders challenge, you know, if anything, it's their idea, you know, but they don't, they don't challenge it.
So for them to really put the brains together, it sounds like he knew how to get more out of both of you, really innovating.
Yes.
And this is where I say like, when I reflect back and I think over the course of my career, all of the value that this would add to then what I say is the, the next role where my boss was Carrie van Bell and you know, she was somebody who, and again, I have immense respect for all of these leaders, but she was the one who really, I don't like to use the word groomed, but she understood the executive boardroom and she knew my skills and talents and she was able to make the tweaks, I guess you could say in a not so subtle way, she was very direct in telling me what I needed to do and how I needed to change, especially in bigger presentations.
So I remember one particular presentation.
I was quite nervous before I went in, but very excited about what, you know, was coming to light in this particular meeting.
And afterwards she pulled me aside and said, okay, that was great.
You did X and Y very good.
But next time I want you to do it this way and showed me exactly how I could have done the same thing, but a little better.
And so these were in the moment, very good coaching techniques that actually helped me move into that executive role that I took on.

Christine Laperriere:
My challenge as somebody who does a lot of leadership development is always the correlation or the return on investment.
So I ask every person that I interview, what do you think the return on investment is to a business when they have a best boss ever versus a very mediocre boss?

Stephanie Wolfe:
The return on investment is talent and output.
I think those are the two biggest things that they'll get because, so I think back to the opposite.
So the ones, the roles where perhaps they didn't have the best boss ever and what happened there, I didn't feel motivated.
I didn't do as great a job.
I wasn't pushed.
I didn't feel the need to really do much more than my description.
And so each of these leaders, not only did they shape who I became as a leader and who I am today in my career, but I did my best work for them because they knew what I was looking for.
And so I think the ROI is that you're just going to get a better return on the person that is working for you at that time.
And I mean, I know you've probably said this on this podcast before, but people never leave the company.
They leave like the boss.
I will say that it was very difficult for me to leave.
There was only one where she had already moved on, but for each of those other roles, it was difficult to make that decision to move on.
And it was often other circumstances have nothing to do with the leader.

Christine Laperriere:
Sure.
I mean, you're right.
Most of the time it's the leader, but not so much every time.
Right.
And I mean, it's wonderful when you can actually leave a position, look back and feel like you really got something amazing out of that besides just your salary, right?
That's interesting to that.

Stephanie Wolfe:
I'll just say that I think that that's maybe why I have been such or why I've had such an opportunity to work with great leaders is that I think it takes two, right?
You have to be also willing to share your thoughts and your growth and your challenges and what your ambitions are in order for that leader to actually effectively help you.
So I think that it plays a role too, in the person who is reporting into this boss to tell them what it is that you want to do with your career.
And so I think it works both ways.
And like I said, perhaps that's why I've been luckier than some to have these great bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's also, you know, it's a fantastic point and it's something again, we don't bring that up very often, but it sounds like you were willing to be coached.
You were willing to be invited to the table.
You were willing to lean in when, when you got invited.
It probably made those leaders have fun with the journey of working with you and seeing you grow.
What has not worked when you've seen different inexperienced, different leadership styles, like what is something that doesn't work well for you?

Stephanie Wolfe:
I just had the image come to me right now, as you asked me that question of, and I will not name names, but yelling, yelling behind a closed door out of anger, frustration to me is just a sign of weakness in a leader that if you have to yell at your employees for any reason whatsoever, that's a sign of personal weakness, not leadership.
So that for me is an instant turnoff, not going to work.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's such a great point.
You know, it's interesting.
I've coached, I coach, obviously a lot of female leaders in crying is always like the classic call that I'll get the emergency call, right?
Will be even at the president level.
It's like something's happened and I'm frustrated and I've cried.
And I'm always like, people express emotion in different ways.
And interestingly enough, yelling is one of the things we probably don't talk about that enough because I don't yell.
I might get teary eyed, but I know quite a few leaders that I've worked with who, when their emotions get the better of them, it turns into yelling, which is much more, in my opinion, a brace than somebody getting teary eyed.

Stephanie Wolfe:
Exactly.
And, and it's an automatic loss of respect in some ways for me personally, perhaps not for others, but there's a better way, I think, to approach it.
And oftentimes the, I would say the tears come more from maybe perhaps disappointment or frustration or whatever it might be.
The yelling was coming from a place of true anger.
And I think that if you're unable to control those types of anger emotions with your employees, then there might be some work that needs to be done.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, you might need some coaching.
Do you have any other stories?
I mean, you're a mom of three and you've gone through maternity leaves and I know you've had the nights where you lost sleep and all of those things while you were navigating a busy career.
Anything else that comes to mind when you think of what worked well or didn't work well as you were trying to build a family at the same time that you tried to pursue a pretty intense career?

Stephanie Wolfe:
So yes, I will say that it hasn't always been easy.
There has been a lot of sleepless nights, but you know what?
It's finding truly the people that I surrounded myself with to help me through this journey and also, you know, relying on myself.
So I would say I had some very strong mentors, one in particular, Greta Cusworth, somebody who I value her opinion to this day.
She has guided me since 2011.
We were actually connected through the women's executive network back in 2011, and she has always been there for me as I've gone through different career transitions and made different decisions as it came to my career.
And she was somebody who I truly respected because she had grown adult children at that time when we first met.
And so she understood some of the challenges that I was going through at that time.
So she was kind of my shoulder to cry on when it was difficult, but also somebody who offered sound advice throughout my career.

Christine Laperriere:
She sounds fantastic.
That's great.
Listen, Stephanie, it was so nice to talk to you.
Thank you so much for your time today.
Any words of wisdom you just want to pass on to those leaders that are listening and trying to figure out how to be the best boss.

Stephanie Wolfe:
Know that every single one of your employees is looking for guidance in some way.
You just have to find out what it is and you can help them.
Thank you so much, Christine.

Episode: 31
Title: The value of natural consequences
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jeff Barrett

Christine Laperriere:
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and today I've brought Jeff Barrett onto the show.
I'm thrilled to have Jeff because in the middle of the pandemic, I was really struggling with how to help bring my kids up in this environment that's been so challenging.
Through lots of hunting for great schools and great education options, I stumbled across the Blue Mountain Wild School, which Wild stands for Wilderness Integrated Leadership Development.
So, Jeff, thank you so much for being on the show.

Jeff Barrett:
Thank you.
Thanks so much for having me.
This is really exciting.

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I'm going to take a little different lens.
I do want to hear about your work experience and some of your leadership experience and how it shaped the way that you're leading Wild School.
But from there, I'm actually going to also pick your brain on how you're raising these to help understand a lens of leadership and kind of how you're bringing that into the programs that you're delivering at Wild School.
So it'll be kind of two parts that we're going to talk about today.
So I'm going to start with you first.
Just tell us a little bit of, yes, your background, where you've worked.
I've heard you've had lots of interesting jobs and a little bit about what you experienced from leaders in leading up till today.

Jeff Barrett:
I have had a very eclectic and storied background.
I've done some interesting things.
A bear viewing lodge in the Great Bear Rainforest for the Kirsi Khekhe people.
I've worked in Antarctica.
I've worked in the Arctic.
I've set up an eco-tourism program in Arvi at Nunavut.
I started a tourism program in the Yukon for the Karakostagish First Nation.
Worked up in Kalani up in the parks up there designing eco-lodges.
I've designed eco-lodges all over the world in Oman, O'Hamas and Antigua.
So I've had a long yandering career.
Looking back, it does make sense.
At the time, it probably made very little sense to myself and anyone watching the different directions.
But I think I've been really led by just a deep love for wild spaces and wild places and the people that live in those places as well.
And I've seen a lot of great people come out of really remote and extreme places and really their teacher has been, in many cases, has been the wilderness and the upbringings that they've had in those places.
So a lot of that has been influential in what we're building here with Wild School.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me a little bit about when the wilderness is your teacher.
You know, what does that look like?

Jeff Barrett:
My kids are in ski racing.
I came from a ski racing background.
And one of the great additives of ski racing is the clock ever lies.
And I think the wilderness is that aspect.
You can say many things, you can hide behind many excuses.
But at the end of the day, when you're on a canoe trip and you're cold and you're wet and you're miserable, there's nowhere else to hide.
You know, I always say there's there's two types of leaders in this world.
There's the people that complain about the leaky tarp and there's the people that go out and fix the tarp.
And, you know, what we're trying to do at Wild School is take those kids and show them that, you know, you got to fix the tarp.
No one's going to fix it by yourself and you can complain all you want.
But at the end of the day, it's just you and the elements.
That's amazing.

Christine Laperriere:
And, you know, and I think of coaching so many leaders, that aspect of leadership gets lost.
I think lots of people will talk about bosses that they've worked for, who, you know, are definitely not interested in fixing the tarp.
They're hoping to complain and help somebody else fix the tarp.
So I think that's brilliant.
Tell me a little bit more about the type of leaders you've had.

Jeff Barrett:
I know they've probably been all different types, but some of the things you learn not to do while you were being led by others.
I think I've had the range of bosses that were either completely laissez-faire, offering just sort of essentially throwing me to the wolves and the other one of micromanaging me to the point of exhaustion.
I had this one boss who I was working as a landscape architect, and he hired me on to be a landscape architect.
He was not a landscape architect, but he just felt like he knew everything about landscape architect, and he would sit there and he would talk and talk.
I go and ask him a simple question, and he'd talk to me for an hour and a half.
I'd have to work late into the night to finish the work because I'd spent half the day just listening to this person talk to me about absolutely nothing.
He just got to walk away.
I'm like, I can't do that.
That's insulting to a boss.
He's like, trust me.
And so I came back the next day and he was talking and talking and talking.
And I just stood up and just slowly walked out of the room and sat down at the desk.
And he followed me back to my desk.
And I just ignored him and kept working.
I think he sat there for another hour just talking to me.
I just completely ignored him and worked away at my computer.
Wow.

Christine Laperriere:
That goes to show you not so high on emotional intelligence.

Jeff Barrett:
Completely unaware.
I was used to people not listening to him.
It was ingrained in his in his DNA that that was behavior to just stand up and leave and walk away.
But you got to figure out those coping mechanisms with certain people.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
No.
And I mean, that is a good example, again, of, you know, I think there's probably a lot of people listening going, Oh, I've had I've had that boss.

Jeff Barrett:
I know that one is completely oblivious to everything all around it.
And, you know, that really became it became quite intolerable of just that lack of awareness, you know, that lack of self-awareness, lack of awareness of everything that was around them.
And it's a point of embarrassment, too, of client meetings were just missing the point completely.
He was a smart guy, you know, and very gifted in terms of attention to detail and, you know, those aspects.
But from a business perspective of understanding the client, the assignment, you know, just greatly lost on him.

Christine Laperriere:
Just, yes, lost it.
Interesting.
Anything else from your travels?

Jeff Barrett:
Some of the characters I had, I worked in Antarctica on expedition ships, taking passengers on, you know, to various excursions in Antarctica and the Arctic losses I had along the way.
And a lot of them would model themselves on famous British explorers and sort of this pop of, you know, dressing them as sir and and all the sort of the details that went on with the day to day and talk about attention to detail because you're dealing with, you know, the Arctic, you're dealing with firearms, moving engines, parts.
But the best one I had, so I had one that was just, you know, on me for every single detail, you know, made sure I was wearing a watch.
I never wore a watch before that.
You know, you can't operate without a watch.
You know, and looking at my uniform and dressing everything else.
And then and then that same expedition, I had another one that came up and he had zero.
Just let me do whatever I wanted to do.
And I remember feeling just as of, you know, much more accountability and fear for myself from the one that gave me free reigns that I had to make sure all the engines were having.
I had to make sure all these pieces were working because it was on me.
Whereas the other one, I was like, well, he's got this.
He's worried about every he's on me on the type of watch I'm wearing.
Obviously, he's got those other details covered.
So I definitely did a lot better.
I realized that at an earlier age that I liked having the frame of where to go, but being able to give a longer leash, you know, that I had to make sure that that was that I was being dressed because there was no one else to do that.
And that it popped with me.
If those engines weren't working, then there was people stuck out in the ocean.
No one was going to be looking after my shoulder except for me.
And it would come back to me because those people weren't in that boat, knew it was my responsibility in that.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
So your personal accountability.

Jeff Barrett:
Personal accountability.
Yeah.
And I think it's, you know, we talk a lot about our school's natural consequences, and it's really hard for someone in kindergarten that doesn't wear their gloves or jumps in a puddle and is freezing cold to see those connections.
But through repetition of those natural consequences, you quickly see, you know, if I do this, then that's going to happen and you can see it directly.
And again, it goes back to that analogy of in the wilderness, there's nowhere to hide.
If you forget to bring a matches on a canoe trip, you're going to be pretty cold and hungry that night.
And there's no one else, you know, no one else to be responsible except for yourself.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, it's interesting when you talk about that personal accountability, though, and how you teach that, because, like you said, all of a sudden you have more leash, but more personal accountability, which is counterintuitive to a lot of leaders.
They almost feel like if they're not there, you know, micromanaging or coaching the task, that somehow it's going to go wrong.
And I think this is amazing because it was just such a perfect example of how they actually got more value out of you by stepping away and giving you personal accountability, which was important to you.
Yeah, 100 percent.
And letting me fail.

Jeff Barrett:
I mean, I think failure is something that we, you know, we talk a lot about leadership, but we don't truly let people ultimately fail.
So worried about how it looks and how it stacks up.
And then unfortunately, I think we take that into our kids.
We certainly do in school system and we really do it badly in our parenting right now.
I have this book that I'm mulling in my head.
It's called The Art of Deadbeat Dadding.
Probably not a great term, but but you get the concept.
I love it.
Like, you know what?
Like, you know, sometimes I'm very forgetful and mindful.
And my kids have to pick up the slack.
You know, if I send them out, you know, without the right food, without the thing.
And I and we see this a lot with students where a student will come back.
My mom forgot to power my dad, forgot to pack this in line.
And did you check your bag to see if that was back?
It's not your mom's fault.
You're out here without that equipment.
Natural consequences.
And it's a hard one at a really early age, but you keep you keep repeating those things that there is no one to account but yourself.
And that's a big thing we teach at Wild is you're your own pilot.
You're driving the ship.
No one else is steering it.
You're steering it.
And that's our style of that's what we teach.
Leadership is the idea that not so much leading others yet of leading yourself.
And your parents are there for your support.
Your teachers are there for support.
But at the end of the day, you're the person that makes these decisions.
And they have consequences.
You have to make these decisions.
And we're constantly bringing that back to their individual decisions of ruddering their own ship, making them understand that they do have consequences.
And again, the wilderness is the greatest of all teachers because those consequences are so immediately shown.
You don't put enough extra gear.
You're cold.
You don't put a rain jacket on.
You're wet.
You don't put food on right food together.
You're hungry.
I mean, it's just so direct.
And we're able to tie those lessons back to them and really work on those executive functions of, well, did you prepare?
Did you lay out your stuff the night before?
Did you check your involved in making really making them understand that?
Yeah, while there's someone constantly falling around, helicoptering you around at the end of the day, if you don't if you don't check those things, then you're going to suffer those consequences.
Not your mom or dad.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's incredible.
You were just making me think of something, too.
You talked about parenting, right?
And how we're solving problems.
We're over parenting.
And to a degree, we're taking away what just like you gave the example.
It actually feels good to be personally accountable.
There's something really empowering that feels good because when it comes through at the end of the day, you know, you can own the win.
You get to own the win of that.
Yeah, that's such a great point.
If there's failure, but that's right.
But then the winning, it comes back to that.
That's a really great point.
It's yours to have.
Right.
And then the second thing that I love when I'm thinking about the wilderness as a teacher, you know, what's cool about that is it's not personal.
So when you try to raise kids who have those tough love moments and understand consequences, it looks like, you know, some parents would go, oh, God, that's so cruel.
You know, it's so cruel.
I mean, I've done it now that I'm parenting two kids in wild school.
I've done it where I've said, you know, if you don't want to put your boots on, that's fine.
Just go.
All of a sudden, they're standing outside, you know, in their socks and they're like, wait a second, wait a second.
OK, you know, I want my boots.
I want my boots.
So, you know, it's but but but it sounds so cruel, you know, as a parent to go say, sure, go to wild school with no boots on.
Knock yourself out, you know.
But but the wilderness is not doing that.
So because it has a bad day or because it's gray outside or because it's windy and rainy, it wasn't that because it was personally attacking you.
It's just that's the reality.
That's the whole ecosystem of life right there.
Right.
It's like some days are gorgeous and some days are windy and cold.
You know, I think it's that resilience and understanding that none of those things are personal.

Jeff Barrett:
They're just things that we have to navigate.
Yeah, exactly right.
And and it's a little bit of that harshness.
But at the end of the day, there's no choice.
Like you got to keep going.
Like, what are you going to do?
What other choices do you have?
You've got to get to the bottom of that river.
You've got to get across that valley.
You've got to keep going.
Yeah, I get you're wet.
I'm wet to get your cold.
Yeah, you're hungry.
But what would what is the other option here?
You have no choice but to keep going.
And we've had a lot of those moments, you know, we don't obviously we don't try to find those moments, but those moments find you.
And we've all can look back on them in life and that linking those together and looking back on those experiences and reminding our students of those experiences creates confidence.
I've done it or I got through it.
It was bad at the time.
But look at me now.
I'm stronger.
I'm more resilient.
We talk about grit.
Put your head down and keep going.
Yeah, you know, and I and I think those even those smaller lessons where one person's mountain is another person's anthill.
You know, even if it felt really insignificant to someone else, it's significant to other people.
And that's it's that's I think how you get confidence is you.
And you bring it.
You did you did it before.
You've already come this far.
You can do it again.
And looking backwards in order to go forward is really critical in creating strong and strong leadership.
So I don't know if you want to get into this, but we were talking about this earlier before about the idea of how do you prepare for something that you don't know what is coming and the idea of that?
We don't know what we don't know.
You know, there's that statistics that's thrown around 65 percent of jobs in the future don't exist yet.
I don't know how you can predict a number that you don't even know.
But anyway, right, regardless, somebody figured it out.
You have the math on that one and probably a lot smarter than I am.
But we know the world changing rapidly.
We don't know what the future brings.
We never know what the future brings.
So how do you prepare for a trip that we don't know anything about?
What do you put in your bag to go out the door when you don't even know where you're going?
So what we do at Wild School is we focus on this idea of these core competencies or core skills.
And it's the idea that you can parachute into any situation with these core competencies and core skills and you're prepared for it.
So it's the idea of things like resiliency, grit, perseverance, creativity, adaptability and the ability to, you know, I just landed on Mars and my spaceship's broken and the food processor's not working.
What's the solution?
And so our hope is that our students will be able to sit down and say, OK, guys, group up.
Let's go here.
Here's what we know.
Here's what we don't know.
Here are the tools that we have here, the skills.
Let's get to work and solve that problem.
And, you know, and again, it comes back to the dart leaking.
What are the how do we solve this problem?
And, you know, there's obviously this core skills of not tying in ropes and tarps and the actual the physical aspect.
But it's just the ability to solve any problem and to deal with the adversity that happens and to keep pushing.
I just think that is such an incredibly powerful point because I get involved in a lot of conversations with leaders who struggle to lead in ambiguous, complex situations that don't have clear black and white right answers.
Because leadership is that right.
It's just this I guess that's probably what I love about it is it's a mix of left brain, right brain skills like it's kind of like, you know, you might know the path to a more profitable outcome, but you also know that it's going to beat up people and you're going to lose people on the path if you go to the you know.
So you're trying to figure out how do I navigate these multiple layers of the problem at the same time?
And ambiguity is definitely where I'd say most leaders fall down.
It's just like when they can't find the right or wrong.
And what you're talking about is packing a bag for the unknown.
You know, it's like that.
And really, I mean, I just love that.
Just even that thought around how do we teach, you know, kids as they grow older to pack a bag for the unknown?
How can they have confidence in the moment in which it is the unknown?
Because that's the other thing.
I see a lot of people kind of fall down when it's not a textbook situation.
And I think being confident and knowing how to roll up your sleeves and problem solve when there is no playbook.
I mean, jeez, COVID did that to almost every leader I coach.
It's like, here's the unknown.
You've arrived.
You know, nobody knew how to navigate that.
And some did really well with it.
And others, you know, it was a it was a much bigger struggle.
There's always going to be adversity.
There's always going to be problems.
And I think that the the people that find success in those moments can have that confidence again to fall back on those core competencies.
And it doesn't matter what it is.
It can be anything.
It can be life.
It can be, you know, the death of a family member getting fired.
It can be, you know, an acquisition in a company.
It can be a change in leadership.
But you can trust back on that aspect of everything's changing, always changing, everything's always in flux.
That's that's the story of the world.
Like nothing stays the same.
Nature doesn't stay the same.
Nature is always changing.
We need to be always changing as well to keep up for that.
That's a hard thing for a lot of people.
And I think as we get older, adults are the worst in this.
Right.
We build these walls.
We build these.
This is what I do.
This is where I live.
This is where I go back to at night.
This is the thread counter sheet that I have.
This is my morning routine.
This is success and this is comfort.
And I think we get older and older and older and our world gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and more predictable.
I think some of the greatest minds of our world are able to just constantly just shred it all down.
I was listening to Elon Musk the other day and he was talking about when he lived in a tiny house.
The guy, I mean, think about like his net value per square foot of what he owned was like was an outrageous number.
But it was such an interesting fact that he just shredded everything he had because he was too complacent comfort.
He needed to be uncomfortable.
And in through that uncomfortableness and that like, I don't know, this just doesn't feel right.
That's where greatness comes from.
Think about your kids when they when they come back and they say my favorite thing these days is when my kids come back and they say, I'm bored.
Tell me, how do you deal with an I'm bored?
I want to hear it.
Creative is coming down the pipe.

Christine Laperriere:
I can't wait to see what you're going to come up.
You know, and they roll their eyes and walk away.
But we we so badly want to fix that for our kids right now.
We're like, OK, well, have you how about a device?
How about this?
How about that?
We're trying to fix it instead of just like, I got nothing.
Yeah.
Oh, and I can't wait to see what you come up with.
What is going to come up with?
And I've seen some, you know, on the weekend, they invented this game where they were called Don't Step on the Poop.
They had found this like these little like blobs and they were putting it around the room and then they were blindfolding each other and they were trying to memorize a course of not stepping.
I mean, it was so creative in such a small space.
And I think that we were talking about early, but like, how do you solve the world?
We need to be able to have leaders that can create something from nothing.
That's the key of everything, right?
Like, you know, that's why I'm just I'm so blown away.
Back to Elon Musk for a second, like the ability to create something from nothing that doesn't exist, you know, in terms of the way we think is how we will, you know, eventually evolve at a higher rate to creating new ideas for energy and travel and economies that that ideas that don't even exist yet.
But we need to be able to provide that space and that confidence.
And it's those uncertain moments, boredom, fear.
You know, this isn't right.
I've never been in this space anymore to jump off that cliff.
The natural world is not a comfortable place at times.
Anyone slept out in the rain, you know, slept in a ditch, slept on a beach and been cold and wet and miserable knows that feeling intimately of like, you know, it's not comfortable sometimes.
But if you can rip it all away, take it all away, take that house, take the car, what are you left with?
And that person is an ability to stand on the platform of your inners, your core, your confidence, your core competencies, your values set to solve and have that confidence.
Get about it.
Those leaders are going to change the face of this planet.
I love it.
This is just amazing to me, because I'm so excited as someone who works with all of the adult leaders.
I'm just so excited about the concept of bringing kids up with this at the start, like instead of waiting to try to teach it to somebody who, you know, has had all the great schools and has kind of had an insular life.
And then they're, you know, trying to navigate corporate.
Like, why couldn't we start early?
And build this into the way kids are raised versus it being something that they have to learn in business school, hypothetically, which they don't.
Nobody learns it in business school.
You know, one other thing I want to add to this.
So one thing that I've noticed, first of all, I've noticed personal accountability, I have to say, as my six year old begged to stay up late last night to finish her homework, begged.
I'm like, I'm torn.
I'm like, you're going to get you're going to be short on sleep, but you really want to finish this.
She's like, Mom, I got to finish this before bed.
I'm like, all right, you know what, I'm going to let this go.
But, you know, personal accountability, like she was really feeling like, you know, she would not sleep at night if she couldn't get that done.
The other thing that I've been really impressed with that I've picked up from the teachers in both of my children's classes is this concept of teaching inclusion.
And I don't even know if people are really like, I'd love to hear your point of view on it, because I feel like I'm not hearing a lot of anti bullying or trying to teach kids not to do things.
I'm hearing more proactive teaching about the kind of culture that is going to work for everyone and teaching kids how to be, you know, inclusive, like I'm noticing that, you know, I'm hearing, you know, we're not letting kids like sit by themselves or we're not letting kids kind of we're just kind of teaching them to really act as a pack in a family, you know, kind of regardless of their differences.
So I'm just curious, like, was that on purpose?
Is that just kind of an offset of the way that things are?
What are your thoughts?
Yeah, I mean, it definitely hits towards our core, some of our core values.
We teach a lot about empathy and, you know, just in that is self-awareness and understanding, you know, beyond yourself, getting out of your own emotions, getting out of your own world and seeing other lenses.
And I think once you could do that, then you can see things a lot more clear.
You know, the students sitting by themselves eating lunch, you're outside of yourself.
You're seeing that.
So it's a difficult thing to teach, especially to younger students.
But we just we do it just by repetition, just constantly flipping things around.
You know, the teacher saying, you know, the student outbursts and not listening, flipping that around me.
How is that what you're doing right now making me feel and really trying to get an answer, not the like, not good, you know, but like we like if you were talking right now and I wasn't listening to you, how would that make you feel in that situation?
And also, what about your neighbor here?
That person is listening and they can't concentrate.
How would that make you feel and driving that point quite deeply in and really getting them to understand that, again, that those actions have implications, not just on yourself, but on other people, that there's there's more to their community, to their class than just their own experience of it.
And that is a is a big aha moment for us, you know, early on in formulating this is, you know, the beyond yourself that you're we often kind of walk around through this tunnel lens that everything's about yourself and not about the community, the other individuals and your teacher.
Like how how is are you making your teacher feel?
You know, sometimes I worry it gets a little into like you're listening to them, but it's not.
It's really just asking difficult questions.
And we do a lot of that.
We ask a lot of difficult questions and then push it harder, you know, press it a little bit.
What do you mean by that?
What is and not looking for that canned response of not good.
What would you do you mean by not good?
Like, what are those emotions and trying to label emotions, too?
You know, that's something I think that we've come along.
We've evolved as society is, you know, when I was growing up, mental health was like an other thing.
And it's like, yeah, how do you didn't?
There was no degrees of mental health.
There's certainly not like you work on like your physical health.
And, you know, emotions were pushed down.
You know, are you hurt?
Why are you crying in ambulance?
You know, tough enough.
Yeah.
Versus like, you know, how do you actually feel?
Where do you feel that?
And the idea of trying to, you know, looking at emotions and talking about them so that they aren't becoming another thing that they're discussed.
And it's OK to discuss.
I mean, listening to some of our other students, the way they talk about, you know, in situations where I'm feeling that the way they express themselves, sometimes I'm I'm worrying we're creating monsters of, you know, you see the interaction between some of our grade five and six students is quite mind blowing.
But but they can they can identify exactly how they feel and how that those actions are making them feel.
And then in those conversations, they can actually flip it back and be like, I hear how you're feeling.
And this makes me feel you're making me feel sad right now.
You're making me feel sad.
And I don't like how this is going.
And I don't think I'm going to be the best version of myself after this encounter.
You know, I hope we've also given them, you know, the those some of those aspects of like grit and perseverance and adaptability that, you know, they can take that and figure out, you know, maybe expressing my emotions to the bully is not a good idea.
But I can go and express my emotions to my friend or my parents and get it off my off my chest out there and not being internalized and coming up in therapy.
Yeah, exactly.
And I mean, to your point, I mean, I think that that would build stronger teams in the future.
I think, you know, having individuals who know how to communicate when something's frustrating and get it, you know, move past it and having leaders that know how to accept that, hear it, understand it and move past it.
Like those are ironically, you know, big stumbling box today for a lot of people.
So, you know, what you're talking about, there's some huge upside.
They might sound kind of simple, but they don't exist in everyday, you know, working environments.
I guess that's right.
And I think also is that learning that there is no one fit all leader, too.
We teach leadership in these core values of our leader that any style of leadership could bounce off of, but that they, you know, you come back to again, again, listening, engaging, empathy, active listening, respect.
You know, just these sort of these key core values that you could be a hegemonic leader, you could be a servant leader, you could be any type of leadership style you want.
But you need to come back to these kind of these core values.
We're teaching that there's lots of different styles of leadership and that different styles of skills of working as a team.
And they're starting to understand so well that they're quite in sync of like, this person is really good at this.
But that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they can do.
But we can rely on them for that one thing and that you need to understand your people really well to get them for them to each to be the best individual that they can be.
Right.
So I love that.
I mean, again, that theme around really self leadership is what I'm hearing are self led individuals that kind of understand some core leadership value.
You know, again, that sets them up for anything.
Like you said, if they want to be good talkers and they want to be good listeners and they want to be good followers or, you know, any version of it, we don't we don't need to make the assumption that they're all going to stand in front of a large audience and drag them along with them.
You know, it doesn't have to be that that's their future.
But these are core values that work whether they're going to go on to be artists or go on to work in the Arctic or if they're going to go on and work in, you know, corporate environments like those those core values, they hold true everywhere.
There is that idea that leadership is that it's it's that word has become quite loaded, the idea of like you're leading others and therefore you're changing others.
And it's almost like a bit of a power over, you know, that that hegemonic is charging out and everybody follow me and all these different styles.
But I think that the idea of, you know, leadership, what we look at it is more that you be the best version of yourself pilot of own self that we can be.
And, you know, and then decide how you want that style to emerge as you grow and develop.
But it's it's we're giving them a platform that they can jump off of in whatever they want to do.
I think that that that idea of that the one eyes fits all.
Don't know what we don't know.
We don't know what these kids are going to do.
We don't know where they can go.
So the only thing you can do is sort of providing a key foundation of those those core competencies to give them that strength and confidence to let them jump.

Christine Laperriere:

Title: Fostering the next generation of leaders
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Cindy Diogo, Dawn Jardine, Cher Timmins and Catherine Marchand

Christine Laperriere:
On today's show, I am bringing in a panel of fantastic female leaders.
It began with a conversation I had with Cindy.
You're going to meet her soon.
She was sharing with me a little bit of her experience with her best boss ever, but then it started to become clear that she knew lots of other leaders in her organization that had also had some best boss ever experiences.
We decided today to do something a little different, and we're actually going to bring in a panel of great leaders to share their stories.
Cindy, thank you so much.
I'll ask you just to introduce yourself and the panel that we're going to talk to today.

Cindy Diogo:
Absolutely.
I'm so excited to be here.
I'm going to first introduce myself.
I'm Cindy Diogon, the head of talent acquisition here for Wrangle.
When we first had a conversation, I thought it would be a brilliant opportunity for me to bring in some of the most wonderful women that I work with currently.
They're exceptional.
They're leaders in their craft as well.
I'll make an introduction.
I'll start with Dawn Jardin.
She is our Director of Agile Quality here at Wrangle.
I've worked with her in the past as well.
I know her working style.
Then we have Cher Timmons.
I report into Cher.
She is our Chief of Staff and SVP of Operations.
She's been here for about four, almost five years, I believe.
Also, really well connected and just an exceptional leader.
Then last, I have Catherine CMarchand.
She is our Director of People and Culture.
She's also been here for about four to five years at Wrangle and oversees our people and culture and all of our people initiatives as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I love that we have so many people leaders.
This topic is obviously near and dear to all of our hearts.
Absolutely.
Cindy, can I pick on you first, before I bring everybody else in?
When I brought up the topic of who's the best boss you've worked for and why, I know you had some thoughts.
I'd love to hear them.

Cindy Diogo:
Yeah, this is a really interesting topic.
We've been recently thinking a lot about talent acquisition.
I know that in the community, especially, this is the hot topic in attraction.
One of the things that we've been talking about is psychological safety and the ability for leaders and people managers to really create that atmosphere.
When you and I were first having our initial conversation, I actually thought of one particular manager or leader that I had early on.
She really embodied this for me.
Moving into technology, being a little bit younger in my career, she really stood out as a really influential leader because she created the atmosphere for me to be authentic and to be myself, which is something that resonated with me.
I know that we have a lot of those stories, but it really came down to having that and creating that environment where you feel safe and you feel like you can be yourself.
In those situations, when a leader does that for you, it really enables you to flourish and develop your career.

Christine Laperriere:
How does a leader create psychological safety or how did you see this leader do that?

Cindy Diogo:
It really came down to her being quite authentic and who she was as well.
What I really loved about this particular leader is she was just who she was.
She's wonderful.
She was just actually a little bit rough around the edges as well, which I really loved about this particular leader because it just made me feel as though I could be myself.
I had worked previously in a lot of really large corporations who you did have to put on a little bit of a mask.
For me, it was pretending I was a bit more polished than I actually am, especially moving into very large corporations.
You did have to put on that professional persona.
She allowed me the space to just really come in and be myself.
I think being her authentic self and acknowledging that she necessarily wasn't 100% polished herself created that space that I felt really comfortable to be myself as well.
What I really liked about her too is that she was just, I know everyone's talking about this, but she really embodied radical candor.
Really exceptional at just being blunt with me about my blind spots in a way that was really polite but very direct.
I think early on in your career while you're navigating, especially as a woman in the technology world and working in tech, having that ability to have somebody be really direct and forward with you and help you to be like, here's what it is.
Here's what you need to change and shape, I think is something that you need when you're starting off your career as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay, so Shara, I'm going to pick on you second.
Tell me about your best boss.

Cher Timmins:
Yeah, I found that really to be hard to best boss ever, but there's pieces of bosses I've taken.
The best type of boss I've had were those people who had the leadership style of transformational.
They brought you along.
You're in it together.
You're more of a partnership than a boss direct report.
That makes sense.
They give you all the context.
They give you the space to do it in a way that's creative and innovative.
It fosters loyalty and you understand how you support the organizational goals, right?
You could just do this.
And especially for my career, I come from an admin background.
We're not often given those opportunities to be creative or innovative.
So my best boss, I would say if I had to pick one, is the one that has given me the most opportunity in the space to be creative.
And I'll give you one story about that is in COVID times when we were given a department and I've never done it before.
I've never run HR in any sort of sense and given the opportunity to do it my way because I understood the values of the organization and the trust that that boss gave me.
And that I have grown more in these past two, almost three years than I have my entire career.
And it's because I was brought along.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And give me some detail of that.
Just walk me through.
What does a day in the life look like when you're kind of under that type of influence?

Cher Timmins:
Right.
I think this is a buzzword, but I'm going to actually say it.
It's the green field.
It's waking up and coming to this desk, which is a couple steps away from my bedroom because we're working remotely, and being creative, being able to do things that actually value, that impact employees in a positive way.
It's not doing some things, the old mental models, old models of how you run HR.
It's let's do, let's care about people.
Let's believe in our values.
Let's action those values and do something for our employees that they'll love, that positively impact not only their day to day, but their lives.
And that's what that feels like.
It's growth.
And sometimes it's hard.
And sometimes it takes all that relationship capital and moves things forward to influence people.
But at the end of the day, I think when I close down my computer at night, I think, wow, we've done something.
Even if it's just for one person, but we've done something great.
And I think that's what gets me really excited.
And that goes back to that more growth in the last two plus years than ever.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
That is so cool.
Catherine, I'd love to hear from you.
What's your experience of a best boss?

Catherine Marchand: 
Hello.
I also reported to Cher and I can say that Cher definitely walks the talk.
All of the things that she said there, she also does for us.
And I so appreciate that.

Cindy Diogo:
Thank you.

Catherine Marchand: 
But I think like you, Cher, I've also had, I can't really pick one boss.
You know, it's different qualities from different either bosses or other leaders that I've worked with or alongside.
One thing that I think makes a huge, huge impression on me anyway, is a leader who meets you where you are.
Not everybody can do this.
Listening and receiving the information that you're sharing from a place of empathy where you're at, whether that's where you're at in your role and your expertise and your growth in that role, or where your role sits in the organization and the level of influence that you may or may not have, whether or not you're able to unblock yourself.
Yeah, that sometimes can seem sort of unimportant or, you know, a leader sits up here and you can't see me, but I'm raising my arm up here.
You may be down there.
And so your reality is so different and challenges that you have as an employee can just kind of look not as important to other folks who look at very things from a different altitude.
And so, I don't know, really being able to kind of help you navigate these things, but also be with you at the same level in these conversations is not a dynamic that every leader is able to kind of get to.
So I really, really appreciate that.
There's so many other things that we could talk about.
I also come from a bit of a generalist background with, you know, a long time I spent doing admin work, coordination, leading to project management, so on and so forth.
But when you're in these types of roles, sometimes you can feel like you're not really getting to any kind of place of expertise, right?
Like you're kind of maybe spinning in a thousand different directions.
Yes, you're kind of covering a lot of ground laterally, but you're not really digging deep into a vertical that will kind of allow you to take that expertise to your next gig.
And I find a really good boss can help you kind of identify what these strengths are and really clarify for you and help you discover these strengths that you may not even know that you already have.
That's something that I try to do very much in my practice.
And that's helped me a lot, especially earlier in my career, I think.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And then Dawn, let's hear your perspective on this one.

Dawn Jardine:
Yeah, I'm similar to what Shira had said and Catherine and Cindy.
You know, I've worked with several people that have left a lasting impression on me.
And so it's difficult to single out just one, but I can think of two women in my career that early on kind of pushed me into a position of leadership.
I didn't feel like I was ready, but they believed in me.
So I think the trust and the belief in my ability and they had confidence that I had what it took to get the job done.
So that was super important to me.
And they were really open and listening to my ideas.
But at the same time, they had the courage to tell me when I wasn't being realistic.
I was part of projects that were large, big clients, and they had expectations to deliver.
It put some fear in me because I was like, oh, how am I going to do this?
But they really believed in me and helped me along when I had questions and always felt like I could go to them to ask them those questions.
So they didn't feel like I had to know it all.
And I think that's super important.
And that as a leader myself, those are those things that I find are really helpful for my team as well.
Just, you know, I don't know it all, but I'll help you through it.

Christine Laperriere:
So it's like they pushed you out there and let you take that big leap.
But then they were like, I've got your back, right?
You know, I'm going to work with you.
I'm not leaving you out there to hang yourself.
We're going to make sure that you're successful too.
Also, I mean, I'm just kind of curious, do any of you have stories where you think of a not great boss?
Like, what are some of the examples of things that you've seen in your career that really didn't work?
They really limited or stumbled, you know, how it has slowed down your progress.
I'm kind of curious.
What were those like?

Cindy Diogo:
When I went up through, went up through the ranks, so to speak, it was a very different time, very different professional environment than we are in now.
So I think what you, what you tolerated as your younger self to what you would tolerate now is quite different.
Now it's a, it's an environment of, you know, inclusivity of empathy, of trust, of authenticity, all the things we're saying around here now.
But you know, when I was learning how to be a leader or learning how to be employed, it was quite different.
And I think it's there, there's something about that power dynamic to what Catherine said about, I'm holding, raising my hand the levels of where you're at, the legitimate power a title has, the respect you have to give to elders, to people with those titles.
You know, it was never a sense of you're in it together.
It was, you do a job for me and you have to do it really well, or I'm going to tell you in front of a whole bunch of people.
So I always think to myself, what I learned from that is I want to be the leader I needed all those years ago.
And that as a leader that I try to be now, you know, empathetic, meeting people where they're at, bringing people along, hopefully not oversharing sometimes and, and freaking anybody out.
But I think that's the leader I always wanted and the leader I hadn't gotten until very recently.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, it's a very good example.
Yeah.
And the hierarchical piece, you know, and the do as I say, and not as I do, it's just, it's out.
Nobody's, it's still out there and exists today.
But the fortunate thing is, is that in the war for talent right now that we're seeing, that's definitely not going to build your top talent team.
Yeah.

Cindy Diogo:
And it fosters zero growth, zero culture, zero everything.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Dawn, I'm just curious when you think of, you know, what, what hasn't worked well that you've seen?

Dawn Jardine:
Well, I think in your working life, eventually you're going to come across those bosses that, that you might not work as well with.
I've had a few.
I think similar to what Cher says, bosses that we always said beat with a stick had that attitude of like, do what I say.
It just doesn't work well because it makes you feel like you're at a disadvantage.
I've raised two sons and one of the things that I learned as a mom, and I know, you know, it's a different job, but at the same time you're taking care of people, right?
People leader.
And one of the things that seemed to work better was when I listened to them and instead of telling them what to do, listen to what they wanted and understanding having that conversation saying, well, this is what we need to do and making suggestions or making recommendations.
And you can do that with your team as well.
And that just seems to go over much better than, than, you know, this is what you need to do.
I think it goes better with just making recommendations and suggestions and listening to them.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
I have this argument that I think for every hour of parenting that you've done, that should count as some type of hour of leadership training.
And, and I'm not even, I'm only part way into my parenting journey.
And I can already tell you that I've learned more in the last, you know, six years that I have probably in, you know, 15 years of change management before that, because kids keep you on your toes, right?
And you do, you have to come up with creative ways because you get a chance to see that, that that's not progressing, right?
Or you try an approach and all of a sudden you see that you're not getting a very, you know, big result and you care so much that you're, you're willing to change again and try a new approach, right?
So I think that's such a great example.
Cindy, when you think of your not so best boss, I'm just kind of curious, what kind of traits come to mind?

Cindy Diogo:
I tend to learn from the, the negatives, like what not to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Cindy Diogo:
And so something that came up when we had talked about and something that I'm really an advocate for, especially here at Rangel, as well as when women don't advocate for other women.
And so I remember the initial conversation that you and I had that the scenario that came to mind was when I was actually pregnant and I was coming back to work from my maternity leave.
And I remember the leader, there had been a number of transitions while I was on maternity leave and, and the leader, I was up for promotion and the leader told me very upfront that she didn't think that I was qualified for the position because I had a son and the role required travel.
This was pretty devastating.
And I think something that came up to me was, ah, this is still happening.
So there was a little bit of an aha moment, but I think part of my passion and moving forward and what I've learned to take away from that is to be an advocate within the space and especially with young women or women in general, you know, moving into STEM and technology is exponentially more difficult when, when you're a woman.
And, you know, these things like this really affect your career.
And so it was devastating to realize that these things still unfortunately happen to women and there's barriers.
And it's another thing when it's coming from another woman.
So I think the thing that I definitely took away from that story and that scenario was be an advocate in this space and, and encourage women, advocate for them, make sure that they, we're holding space for women and women, especially with children, important because we get stuff done just because we have little ones doesn't mean that we're not and can't be successful in our roles.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, in that message, I hear too, you know, just provide the opportunity and empower someone else to make the choice that's best for them.
Right.
Even if you decided that you didn't want to travel at that age with a young child at home, like let you make that choice about your career and your family and else, you know, whereas we try to make the decision for you.

Cindy Diogo:
Yeah, absolutely.
And with a little toddler, I would have welcomed travel at that point.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
I understand that completely.
So Catherine, I'm curious when you think of those same, now you've heard quite a gamut of traits that didn't work.
What, what crosses your mind?

Catherine Marchand:
This is a tricky one.
This is not about a specific bad boss per se.
I loved working with this person, but I think nonetheless, you know, things happen sometimes and they're a bit of a head scratcher looking back.
Why?
Why?
But I'll share this story, which I'm laughing about now.
Probably didn't laugh about it that much back then.
So we're talking like 10 to 15 years ago, right?
My boss asked me to join them in a meeting with their boss, position this as, I guess, a shadowing slash growth opportunity.
And little did I know, my boss came clean afterwards.
My presence was actually used as kind of a buffer, right?
To change the dynamic of that conversation.
My boss thought and knew in fact they were going to be in trouble with their boss in that meeting.
Brought me in here to avoid, I guess, some sort of explosion.
At the time, I don't think I really kind of grasp, I guess, the severity of how bonkers that kind of behaviors can be, especially for me as the employee having to live with their boss on a daily basis, seeing them in the changed, right?
For that person, was I complicit in this kind of weird approach?
Did I know?
Did I not know?
Do I not care?
All of these questions kind of come rushing after the fact.
And it's just, I could never, and I don't think anyone on this call would ever consider doing this.
I laugh about it now, obviously, and all is good.
But yeah, that really came to mind after hearing everyone's stories.
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
It just goes to show you that there was definitely not a best boss ever in the room somewhere in that conversation.
Because anytime that you're so scared of a discussion that you need to bring another employee in to keep maybe from getting yelled at or whatever your concern is, that tells me that there's not a lot of psychological safety in the house.

Catherine Marchand:
I would agree with that, yeah.
That's a great observation.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
I think that's amazing.
And then I'm curious, as women in leadership, are there any unique challenges that each of you notice or each of you face?
I'm just curious.
You brought up a great point earlier about, you know, kind of women advocating for other women.

Cindy Diogo
We could talk about women in tech, the male dominated industry.
But it's changing over the years.
But I remember when I first started, I think I was one out of 40 guys.
That dynamic was interesting.
But, you know, I learned to navigate that landscape.
And it's challenging at times, especially if you feel like perhaps you have something to say.
But maybe you're in a room full of guys that are talkers.
And that's challenging.
So I've had circumstances where I've had to speak up, you know, hold my own sort of thing.
Yeah, in tech it's a different dynamics there.
But we can support one another if there's another woman in the room.
I think it's really important to support one another and kind of bring them to the forefront as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Make sure they get a seat at the table to talk.
Any other ones that you can think of?
I'm just curious.

Cher Timmins:
This is maybe not the answer to the question.
But I've seen it when it hasn't worked, and we haven't been supportive.
And perhaps that comes out in a I guess, when the focus is on appearance or certain things and not skill or craft or value.
I have seen that throughout my career, actually, which is really unfortunate because I think to what Cindy had said earlier, we have a really special opportunity to create those, perhaps safe haven is too strong and dramatic of a word to use.
But I think there's an opportunity to foster that next generation of leaders and to hold that space for them and share.
And I think to what Dawn said about being in meetings and as maybe the only woman or a few of the women is piggybacking onto what they're saying and saying yes to that.
And this is what my point is.
And I have learned to really speak up more forcefully than I would normally in meeting because you have to.
You just have to.
And I think that is a lesson that I've learned the hard way so many times.
And I'm like, I had that idea.
Or perhaps, you know, I thought of that.
Or that's what I was going to say.
And I always kick myself after that meeting like, why didn't I say that?
So now I say it.
But it's really out of my comfort zone to be aggressive.
But I think you need to start and then you could release the aggression to be heard, if that makes sense.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
And one of the practices you're reminding me of a practice that we've talked about in some different corporate culture pieces around it's shine and rise.
And it's this idea of somebody contributes a point of view that maybe doesn't have a loud voice at the table.
Often it's women and minorities that kind of get lost sometimes.
And you would shine a light on the point that was just made again and elevate how much you appreciate at that point.
And just like you said, it's just kind of reiterating it so that that voice gets heard at the table with an equal presence of some sort.

Cher Timmins:
100%.
And I think everyone around here, we do that for each other, which shows up in various forms.
So I'm really appreciative of this group around here for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And then I'm going to bring us to the one of my favorite questions to ask.
In the world that I'm in, obviously organizations are investing in their people and they're investing in building great leaders.
But obviously everybody wants to know what's that return on investment?
How do we how do we prove that it actually impacts the business?
And so I love to ask each person from their perspective, you know, what's the real impact of having best bosses or bosses that have those great qualities versus having the not best bosses?
I'm curious, when you think of the value, could you explain it to me?
And Dawn, I'll pick on you maybe first.

Dawn Jardine:
That's an interesting question.
When I think of bosses that I've had and the difference there, they they always thought what was best for the business.
But even though their name wasn't on the building, they they thought about the business and how it was important to, they weren't focused on themselves, but it was for the good of the company.
And when I say company, I mean the people as a whole.
You know, if if we're all working towards the goal, the vision of the company, it's not about dollars and cents, but what's good for the people.
Because when people are happy and feel good about what they're doing and they feel like they're a part of something, then your business is going to thrive.
It's going to, because you feel like you you've got a part of that vision.
I know at Rangel, that's that's what we do.
We we we know what the vision is.
We know what we need to do as a business.
And we're all involved, like even with the OKRs, like with my team, we sit around together and think about what's our objectives and how does that lead up into what the business wants to do.
And just understanding that so that you feel like you're a part of what's happening and that in turn will, you know, they're going to treat clients well and they're going to do what needs to be done for the business.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
It impacts your entire client experience from there.
Right.
And like you said, if the primary focus in each meeting is the benefit to the business and not the benefit to the individual, how much more productive are we?
We're getting a lot more done.
If I was CEO of that business, I'd feel a lot I'd be sleeping a lot better at night.
That's a great point.
Cher, can I pick on you?

Cher Timmins:
It's a really hard question to answer.
It's an intangible to a tangible.
And I think the impact that I think it brings is a strong culture.
If people feel more engaged, that people care about their well-being and their growth, they're going to be more loyal.
There's going to be more communication, less mistakes.
You can be more creative and innovative.
You have teams that it fosters that organizational citizenship behavior.
I'll show up for you because you're showing up for me and we're going to make something awesome.
So it's that feeling where, you know, and even if you need to pivot, even if your company is going this way, was going to go this way, that's going this way now, all those teams are ready to mobilize.
They're ready to change and they're ready because they'll follow you anywhere because they care about their teams and the people that they work beside.
And although that's probably not a tangible, but what it does is accelerates the growth of the company.
You know, it ups your bottom line and then you attract more people, more of those specialized people, those talented people and you learn more and it's just sort of the snowball effect that happens at a company.
And I think that's one of the things that I see here that at Wrangle now is that those ready to mobilize teams, that everyone's in it together, they're cohesive, they're learning from each other, communicating and we can do anything.
That's the intangible that has tangible bits later, but that feeling.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
Perfect.
Catherine, what do you think?

Catherine Marchand:
You know, my answer is a great kind of follow through after all the beautiful things that Cher just said.
I think to me, regardless of craft or what your expertise might be as a leader, having that authenticity is kind of, I don't even know what the right term to use is, but that's really what's going to carry you through and help you make these connections and when your leadership is authentic in an organization, for sure you'll have a much easier time managing issues when change might be a little bit sticky or difficult or uncomfortable, I don't know, pandemics.
Hello.
It's been a time, you know, these authentic leaders really help you kind of build and maintain that longevity over other companies where that doesn't exist.
I think that really helps people want to stay with you and weather these difficult moments and I mean, looking at really, really small teams, you know, your ability to retain these people and to not have them take off at the first kind of bump can be really critical.
So many teams are small and lean and when a person goes, you really feel the impact of that and depending on who that team is serving and the organization that has a ripple effects that are pretty significant sometimes.

Christine Laperriere:
Yep, absolutely.
All right, Cindy, what are your thoughts?

Cindy Diogo:
I agree with all of it.
I put on my talent acquisition on my recruiter hat for this question.
I think the ultimate ROI if you're thinking about recruitment and you're thinking about such an aggressive talent market is retention and attraction and best bosses are really great leadership have the impact to really make or break teams.
So from an attraction perspective, it's not uncommon for us to hear that people are interested in joining an organization because they know of that leader.
You know, they've worked with them in the past.
I had a situation specifically with Don.
I've worked with her in the past recruited someone over who knew of Don and so from an ROI perspective, of course, the people are what let you iterate on your product or let you iterate on your vision.
So being able to attract is really one of those big ROIs and then retention as Katherine mentioned as well is also very important.
Retaining that great talent ensures that, of course, you're bringing in people that can creatively look at problems or projects, think of something creative, offer a different offering to clients and really increase the value of the product that you might be presenting to your clients as well.
So I think that's one of the biggest tangibles for me in talent acquisition and recruitment is that that attraction component and then of course, retaining that top talent.

Christine Laperriere:
I love what you just said there.
I mean, I couldn't agree more.
I see that all the time.
Sure, some of us leave jobs for the, you know, other opportunities and bigger opportunities.
But I know from having talked to a lot of people, they don't leave their job.
They leave their leader.
You know, it's it's kind of an, you know, age old adage, right?
And just to your point about, you know, you can fill the seats, but if you don't engage those seats, you're just not getting the most efficiency out of that team.
You know, we're always trying to figure out how to drive more efficiency.
But a lot of its mindset and how people feel about the work they're doing and the contribution they're making.
Last words of wisdom.
I'll just kind of give me a ping if, if you think so, but last words of wisdom for any leader out there who's really trying to make a great impact.

Catherine Marchand:
I would just say very simply, just make the time and show up for the hard conversations.
Even if you have no idea what you're going to say, just show up.
Nobody expects you to have all the answers.
It's all good.

Cindy Diogo:
I would say to make sure that you're creating the conditions that all of your people that you manage or you lead feel safe and they have that opportunity to be really authentic.
I know that there's lots of data and lots of stats out there to say that when people do feel as though they belong in a culture and they feel really that psychological safety.
I know that's another buzzword, but they really do great things.
And of course they impact your bottom line.
They think of new tooling.
They think of new innovative ways to do things and they really do progress your organization.
So being able to create that environment where people feel safe, they can be their authentic self really does impact the organization and the success of an organization.

Christine Laperriere:
All right.

Title: Sending me on a new career path
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Mary Shannon

Christine Laperriere:
Today I invited Mary Shannon onto the show because when I worked alongside you at Vanguard Investments, I was so impressed with how much talent and enthusiasm and the mindset that you brought to the environment.
So it was a pleasure getting a chance to train you and coach you and work with you because so many of us could see that you just were a shining star and kind of on your way to big things.
So I am thrilled that you took me up on my offer to talk about your best boss.
So please introduce yourself a little bit more.

Mary Shannon:
Sure.
Thanks, Christine, for that intro.
My name is Mary Shannon.
I am the ISM or Insight sales manager at Manulife Investments.
To explain the accent, I came from Ireland 12 years ago, for those who don't know me on here.
I was a high school teacher and did a complete U-turn into the finance industry.
Since coming to Canada, I've worked in a number of global investment firms in various sales facing and coaching roles in both the mutual fund and ETF retail space, and most recently in the position of the Insight sales manager in Manulife for the last three years.
In the last 12 years, I've experienced a lot of changes in terms of aspects like the sales role itself, product evolution, and also the role of females in the And I'm very excited to come here because the leaders that have been above me have had a very significant role to play in my journey throughout those 12 years.
And so, yeah, I'm really excited to talk to that.
Amazing.

Christine Laperriere:
So when I ask the question, who's your best boss ever and why, what's the first thought that comes to mind?

Mary Shannon:
Well, I've definitely had a lot of great leaders above me in my time in the industry, and I probably speak to a number of those as we have this conversation, but one that really stands out to me is Jasmina Jihouti, now Jasmina Garbus.
We're still very close today.
And honestly, I wish everyone could get a chance to work with this woman because she is truly inspirational and has really impacted the lives of those that have gotten the chance to work with her.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Tell me more about her.
I'm just so curious.

Mary Shannon:
So Jasmina herself, she's just, when you think about Jasmina, she's such a hard worker, she's very much, you know, lead by example, tough, but fair.
And she really empowered myself and a lot of those around me and gave us the tools that we needed to succeed in our own merit.
So, you know, when I think of Jasmina, what her real strength was that she recognized the strengths in others that they might not even see themselves.
You know, my story coming over here, I knew three people coming to Canada.
I was a teacher, you know, it was going to be very difficult to get into that industry.
I took a chance and met with Jasmina about an administrative role in this small investment firm.
And basically, she gave me the role straight away, no questions asked.
I was shy.
It was a new environment.
It was a new industry.
I was quite introverted, I would say, all those years ago.
And she saw the potential.
And basically within a couple of months, she took me into her office and said, Mary, I really think that you're made for more than this role.
I see a sales trade in you and I think that you'd be really successful in trying that aspect out.
How do you feel about going into the sales side of things?
And so, you know, I took a leap of faith, you know, she really just how she positioned things to me throughout the years has really been, you know, give it a try.
If you fail, it's OK.
But, you know, anything's possible if you put your mind to it and if you work hard.
And that was a mentality that I already had, you know, the work hard and just put your head down.
But she gave me that opportunity and it has really led me onto the track of, you know, sales progression that I've had ever since.
And you never saw yourself in sales before that?
I never even considered it because I was on a different career path at home.
You know, I had come here for one year with my then boyfriend, now husband, saying, we'll do a bit of travel before I settle down into the high school role.
You know, once you get into one, you have to cling on to it with both hands.

Christine Laperriere:
So you were going to be a high school teacher, right?

Mary Shannon:
Right.
That was my track teaching music and geography.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
Yeah, and civics.
So really, it was just she kind of made that U-turn for me.
The reason why I'm still in Canada, we were supposed to be coming back.
And ultimately, I fell in love with the role, the industry and the family that was built in this company.
It was a very small company.
We were very close knit.
And she, I would say it was a huge part, if not the primary part of creating that culture.
She was very much having fun.
She would come to the pit every morning, tell a story, have some banter, get us all excited to get on the phones or go out and meet clients.
And we, you know, essentially we're work hard, play hard environment together.
So that's what I fell in love with.
If I'm to get even more personal, you know, I had a challenges with my visa to stay after two years.
And she stepped up, sponsored me through the company and actually was the reason why I'm still here today.

Christine Laperriere:
She sponsored you to stay in Canada.

Mary Shannon:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
So that's amazing.
Like, she really helped you remove some pretty big obstacles to.

Mary Shannon:
She shaped my life, basically.
Amazing.

Christine Laperriere:
Tell me what the morning was like.
You know, you mentioned that experience.
So she'd bring the sales team together into the pit.
Tell me a little bit about that.

Mary Shannon:
Well, you know, being in a sales role, you have to be very kind of vocal.
You have to be very charismatic.
She wanted to create that storytelling culture.
And since then, you know, as I progress in different companies, I've done courses on how to tell stories.
This was her roots version or from the ground up version of that, just teaching us, showing us how to tell stories, but also doing it in a way that created team camaraderie and really brought us all together.
So, you know, nobody was talking through this.
Nobody was on the phone while she was standing there.
We were all very present and we were all chiming in as well.
She encouraged everybody else to speak up.
So it's really her natural way of training you to take that risk, share your stories, share your personality, but also then preparing us for the phones.
It's a bit of a Wolf of Wall Street moment.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Right.

Mary Shannon:
Only in a slightly different way.

Christine Laperriere:
Sure.

Mary Shannon:
But she's getting you warmed up and she's kind of getting the, you know, everybody's heading the game for work and getting them excited about the day ahead.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Mary Shannon:
And I will say that at the start, you know, it's it's quite intimidating to be part of that and you're you're having this inner conversation saying, well, I'm not going to speak off.
You know, I'm just here.
I'm very green.
I'm very new and nobody wants to hear what I want to say.
But ultimately, she was encouraging you to get past that and really, you know, speak up, empowering all of us to do that.
And another maybe conversation I was having was that I was one girl among a bunch of guys in the sales role.
You know, back in the day, there wasn't that many females doing this.
And while we had a number of women who were empowered in our company, and I would say she built that as well, she was very much an advocate of women and where we needed to go or where we belonged and built us up.
And I would say I was probably, you know, there was a majority of men around me in the sales side.
When you had a female leader that you could look up to, what do you think that did for you personally, given that there was all men around you?
I think it made me brave and it really gave me the voice to speak out be confident and make an impact, not just within the company and among the team, but to our clients as well.
So it was really important for me to be able to be comfortable in those conversations, take the reins almost.
You don't want to be on the phone to somebody who's trying to partner with you, sell you something.
And they're second guessing themselves.
She gave me a strong voice and you nearly take that from her.
Like she was a very strong woman.
Sometimes she'd have all of the sales guys terrified of her.
Not in a bad way.
You know, there are those bosses that are leading with fear.
She's not doing that, but she just had this presence about her.
And she wanted all of us to have that as well.
So it was really trickling down effect of be confident, speak up for what you believe in.
And ultimately, it led to me having more conviction around what I was speaking of on the phone to our clients.
I had confidence.
I had conviction in what we were doing and what we were bringing to them.

Christine Laperriere:
That is very interesting to me.
That's such a good example of I always say culture is this interesting thing where it's like we replicate each other's behavior.
That's what culture is.
You know, there's this we don't know why, but subconsciously we kind of pick up other behaviors.
So when she's being confident and she's having conviction, you know, so much conviction that she's even, you know, people are kind of standing back and going, whoa, that to me, you know, like you said, she's instilling that and the rest of the team.
And that's really powerful.
That's an example of really good leadership and culture building.

Mary Shannon:
And culture is the reason why I'm at a company.
It's the reason why I stay.
And I think that is the case for a lot of people, if not more now, you know, people are more selective today, having gone through COVID, having gone through work from home about what the company does for them.
And if you have a really great culture and somebody who's going to stick their neck out for you as well, which is what she was constantly doing for us.
You know, she she was emotionally invested in our development and what we did and how we progressed.
And I can say that for sure, because she kept it up right, you know, even after I left the firm.
And that just brings a loyalty that money can't buy.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it's amazing.
So now my question for you is I get challenged repeatedly about the impact of a great boss financially, if you're investing in your people, like what is the return on investment?
So can you think of the impact that her leadership had to the bottom line?

Mary Shannon:
For sure.
And I think, you know, what I was saying kind of alludes to that as well is that it brings a commitment from your people and it motivates you to really lean into your strengths and work hard.
You know, like I was working for Jasmina in my mind, you know, and a lot of us would say that it wasn't just I wasn't me in a silo.
I would say a lot of us were doing this for a person versus a thing.
You know, like it brings it to life and it keeps you engaged.
It gives you purpose as well, which is something that I read in the book about the All Blacks and legacy.
So they talk about purpose being very important for what you're building towards.
And if you have the right leader at the top, then they're communicating that in a way that is tangible and engaging and nothing can drive people stronger than that, I think.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm just curious, then, would you say numerically that that also drove a financial end result?
I would say yes.
And you know what?
I'm thinking of a very specific story when I think about that.
You know, when I came in, I didn't know anything about the industry.
I was literally starting from zero.
I didn't even do economics in school.
And so, you know, she really did take a chance on me.
But ultimately, I remember a I was taking the CSC, first of all, to get up to speed in the book sense.
But I just clearly remember just Mina and a wholesaler sitting down in the boardroom and literally going through what a bond was to me.
So so this is a woman who's running operations, marketing and sales all at once.
And then she's still making the time to sit down and teach me about, you know, the very fundamental basics of investments.
And it really went a long way in terms of a building up my knowledge, preparing me for the role, you know, that coaching didn't stop there.
She was constantly guiding, talking about messaging.
Every sales meeting we had, we were either brainstorming together as a group or pitching, you know, working on our message.
And of course, that's going to lead to results.
You know, if you're confident, if you're ready on the phone or in your meetings, that's going to lead to dollars in the door.
People are going to want to do business with you.
And so 100 percent, she was at the helm of that.

Christine Laperriere:
Now, when you think of bosses that were not the best.
And so I, you know, it doesn't have to be a worst boss, but I'm just kind of curious, like, what have you learned from the bosses that maybe you didn't try to replicate their style, but you saw things that didn't work for you?

Mary Shannon:
Well, I think in what I've shared so far about just Mina was the loyalty, the family feel and just everybody in it together.
And I didn't have a worst boss as such, or I wouldn't label anybody I've come across as a bad boss, but there were moments where I felt discouraged, disengaged in a conversation with a leader.
And one that sticks out in my mind was a certain period where I had gone for a role.
I didn't get the role that had opened up within internally in the company.
And I went to this leader and asked, what do I need to do to get there?
This is where I want to be.
What do I have to work on?
What are the gaps?
And ultimately, the leader, first thing they said was, have you considered looking outside of the company for the role?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Mary Shannon:
And in reflecting back on that moment, first of all, it was a glaring sign to me.
OK, well, this person, I'm not sure if this is going to happen for me here.
And the conversation went farther along and there was practical steps and the usual kind of this is this is what I would do.
But in reflecting further on that moment, I think it was genuinely the best advice that they thought I should hear.
It was a smaller company.
They weighed up the reality and the situation and thought this can't happen here.
But if I were you, this is what I do.
I genuinely think it was, you know, genuine advice.
And whereas I was maybe a little demotivated in that moment, I think others would see that as a no brainer.
Yes, that was the thing to do.
And that's exactly what I needed to hear.
And I think basically it depends on the stage you're at in your career and your mindset.
And ultimately, I've been at other points of my career where someone has advised me, a leader has advised me, you know, do always have the conversation.
If somebody approaches you for always have the conversation.
And I heard that completely different, essentially the same advice in this moment.
And so what I would say is a strong leader knows where the person is at, knows what speaks to that person, maybe resonates with them and what doesn't.
That's kind of where I'm at with that one.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's an interesting question.
But it's got to be very demotivating when you hear, you know, have you thought about looking outside the company?
You know, that's basically not what any of us, I guess, want to hear when you're actively pursuing something, you know, that you're passionate about.
What advice would you give?
So there's lots of people listening into this show.
The many of them are either individual contributors or their leaders, and they're trying to think of how to be better and more effective leaders.
What kind of advice would you have for them?

Mary Shannon:
So in terms of advice, I think it depends on what stage you're at of leadership or getting to leadership.
You know, depending on that stage, I would give different advice.
But in thinking about great advice that I got at the beginning of leadership, I was told I was coming in, I was reading every leadership book.
I was trying to, you know, talk to everybody I knew that was a good or great leader, trying to get tips.
And ultimately, it's very hard to put it in words.
And that's what I noticed when I was looking for advice.
And the best way it was put was forget about the rest.
Just get to know your team.
Just cut out the noise and take the time to really get to know them.
It will take time.
It might take longer than you expect.
But ultimately, once you do that, you will be able to navigate things a lot more.
You'll have their trust, you'll have their open honesty.
And the only way that you can succeed as a leader is excellent communication between you and everybody else.
And so I find that to be just simple, but very effective advice coming into it.
I think that's brilliant advice, especially given that so many people kind of skip that step.
They sort of assume they're going to get to know their team over time, but then they're trying to navigate complicated issues without really understanding people at their core.
And so I think that's, like you said, simple, brilliant, you know, easier said than done advice.
It actually takes being intentional to to accomplish that.
Just to comment on that, you know, as you go into the role, it gets busier and busier and you're pulled in all these different directions.
And so if you can do that from the very beginning, it will make all the difference.
But it also lays the foundation for you to always put them first.
So no matter what else is going on and what other initiatives you're being pulled towards that might take you away from your team or just bring you that bit further away.
I think that I have always put them first because I know them, I know what they need.
And ultimately, I think that's what a great leader does.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Right.
That's amazing.

Mary Shannon:
You are a phenomenal relationship builder.
I really admire that about you because you are amazing at staying in touch with people and being thoughtful and staying connected.
We've had a couple of years now where we might not see each other all the time, but you you do a phenomenal job.
Do you have any systems or ways of staying organized that you help helps you keep those touch points with so many people that you've interacted with?

Mary Shannon:
I mean, there's part of me that puts names on a spreadsheet and maybe gently keeps an eye on that.
But ultimately, it's really that something reminds me of a person I want to reach out or when I come across a person that has an impact on my life, like yourself, Christine, I have really appreciated our conversations over the years and being able to work with you as well.
Those people just stay in my mind and I want to keep those relationships up.
They're really important to me.
And I find that the more that you do that, there's no downside to that, right?
Both personally and professionally.
I think that it's great to have that Rolodex, you know, or that gentle spreadsheet, but I don't really have a solid process around it.
I just, yeah, it just kind of comes naturally in the way.
Is that terrible to say?

Christine Laperriere:
Not terrible at all.
It's brilliant.
I just am so impressed because I'm like you, where I meet wonderful people that blow my mind and I want to stay in touch with.

Christine Laperriere:
I get into that, you know, too busy kind of thing.
So that sometimes I come back and I'm like, OK, I need to go reconnect.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And so again, you know, I'll see something on LinkedIn or I'll see, you know, someone's name come across the announcement of your son.
OK, great.
There's a great reason to connect or a great reason to, you know, like you said, remember that person.
But I was just wondering because I'm like, you are so masterful at it.
It's wonderful.

Mary Shannon:
What I will say is, you know, I say that it comes naturally, but in terms of even you have sparked a memory in my mind of my current boss, Trevor Archer, who is amazing.
Another really inspirational person who has, you know, he he truly embodies that we're in this together.
You know, he really empowers you.
He lets you make those high stakes decisions and asks for your input is so genuine about, you know, let's figure this out together.
But in that conversation, you know, we're always talking about work.
We're always down to business.
It's extremely busy environment, but he still makes the time to talk about that networking conversation.
And manual life is such a big place.
It's not natural there.
You don't just bump into people in the hall, especially in the last two years.
It has to be an effort.
So when I talk about the spreadsheet, that is definitely where I I bring that out a little bit more and get systematic around it.
And so when I talk to him about my development, where I want to go to next, he's the one pulling names from his head, saying, well, let's let's have a conversation started with this person, or can I connect you with X, Y and Z?
So in that way, it is more planned out and systematic in terms of tracking what I do next, the follow up.
But ultimately, the conversations are all those getting to know you and just building that rapport, just like those personal ones that kind of we've we've built up.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
That's a great, you know, so there's a bit of strategic.
Sometimes it's kind of coincidental.
Sometimes there might be that gentle list.
But I even love the fact that Trevor does give you good coaching on reminding you who to reach out to.
So it sounds like he's also very thoughtful about relationships.
And so it makes it easier to, you know, brainstorm who should we be talking to?

Mary Shannon:
It's so true.
And in terms of that aspect, I think that's a neglected aspect for a lot of people that being mindful about your networking and actually making it happen within your career, within your company.
And I must give a shout out to Jason McIntyre, who you know well from Vanguard, you know, an old boss of mine who positioned it in a different way than I had heard it before.
You know, he put this development card in front of me, which was something that I needed to fill out for a skip level with him.
So I'm meeting with my boss's boss.
And basically, I outlined my strengths, what I wanted to work on, the next role or what I was building towards and who I needed to get in front of to get there, who I needed to impress, basically.
And so there was that whole networking aspect is built into that fourth quadrant of that conversation.
And it was a really clever way of putting it, because even women have been tarnished a lot with the whole put your head down and get your job done and not talk to people about where you want to go or not showcase what you're doing.
And so when you have a process like that, it really does bring it to life.
It makes you more cognizant of it, mindful of what you need to do to get there.
And so I've carried that on with me well beyond that conversation.
And I find it very useful today to to coach my team and and have them be mindful of those conversations and being purposeful about it.

Christine Laperriere:
This is amazing.
Thank you so much.
This was wonderful content.
And I'm sure so many people got so much out of this conversation.
So thank you so much.

Mary Shannon:
No problem.
Thanks for having me.

Title: We are family
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Rick Renaud

Christine Laperriere:
Today I have on Rick Renaud, and I'm thrilled that he reached out via LinkedIn to tell us a little bit about his best boss as he listened and reflect to the podcast.

Rick Renaud:
It's my pleasure, Christine.
I'm glad to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
And Rick, just for a quick introduction on yourself, can you share with everybody just a bit of kind of where you're calling in from?

Rick Renaud:
Well, I'm calling in just about half an hour southeast of Ottawa, nation's capital, in a small little town called Russell.
My wife and I have been here for almost 25 years, raising our two wonderful children who are no longer children, unfortunately.
My son is now 21, and my daughter will be 20 in December, so our family is pretty well all grown up.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me, I mean, you said you saw the question, I'm curious.
Tell me a little bit about that best boss that you were thinking of.

Rick Renaud:
Well, I'm going to go back in time a little bit.
I'm 53 now and this this individual came into my life in the mid 80s, so I was in my early 20s at the time, fresh out of college with a basic electronics diploma, very eager to start using that knowledge.
This man who took me on in his little electronics shop on the Quebec side of the border here in Ottawa, that town called Hull, where his father started this business in the early 60s, 1963, to be exact.
And he took it over after his father's passing.
He hired me on as a salesperson slash electronics repair individual.
During that time, people actually brought their electronic equipment in for repair.
It wasn't the throwaway society like we have today where you buy a piece of equipment and five years it stops working, you toss it out and go and buy a new one.
Back then, a VCR, you know, the average cost of a VCR was about $1,200.
I'm not even going to go into what a VCR is for the young listeners.
You can Google that.
So he hired me on.
I think I was probably 20 years old when he hired me on.
As I said, I was ready to college and right away he took me under his wing, taught me what his company does and what his store was all about, the family heritage and so forth.
But it was more than just an employer-employee relationship right off the bat.
He had a knack of drawing people in and making them feel so absolutely welcome and so individually important to the success of his business that you couldn't help but love being around this man.
I'll give you an example.
When I first started, it was right during the time that they were doing inventory at the store, and this was a store that not only sold electronic devices such as, you know, sound systems and video machines and television and so forth, but they also did repairs on all of these products.
So he also sold electronic components, printed circuits and IC boards and all kinds of different components and so forth.
So each individual component during the inventory had to be counted, obviously.
So he tasked me, one of the first tasks that I had was to count the footage of wiring that we had, the different types of wiring that we sold to people.
There I was rolling out these coils of wire that had thousands of feet of wire on them and counting every foot manually.
And he let me do this for about an hour and then him and one of the other employees came behind me and the two of them were laughing.
And I looked at them and I'm like, what's so funny?
And they said, you know what, you're going to make it well here.
I said, why is that?
He says, we don't count the wire by the foot.
He says, we just estimate the role.
So right off the bat, you know, they played a little trick on me and it made me feel accepted day one that, no, this was going to be a fun place to work.
And it never ended after that.
It was just one fun time after another and it became, it wasn't a job.
It really wasn't a job in my mind back then.
It was kind of a second home.
It was a second family and that's the way he treated every single employee he ever had under him.
He treated them just like family and his wife was identical.
They would go out of their way to accept you into their home.
We used to go out for dinner at least once or twice a week and he would always pick up the bill.
He would never let any of us pay for it.
And he wasn't, you know, he wasn't a wealthy man by any means.
He provided very well for his family.
He treated his employees with respect and consideration that you went under your way to do the most you possibly could for this man.
And I think that's why he was such a great success.
Because he treated his people with respect and dignity and gave them a sense that they were very important to the success of his business.
It was easy for his employees to do well for him.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Rick Renaud:
They had no problem going the extra mile for him.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Rick Renaud:
He was an amazing, amazing guy.
There was another time where I was going through a bit of a rough patch in my early 20s.
I had had a long-term relationship and it kind of went sour and things, you know, just didn't work out as they do at that age.
And I was feeling pretty low and pretty down.
I don't know what it was, but he just had a way of making me feel like it wasn't the end of the world.
And at the time I thought it was, okay, this is it.
I'm, you know, I'm done.
This is over.
You know, the whole dramatic, you know.

Christine Laperriere:
My heart is broken and it will never be.

Rick Renaud:
Exactly.
Yes.
I will never get over this.
We spoke on many occasions about it and he said, you know, this is only a stepping stone, Rick.
You got to take it as an experience and move on.
And yeah, it hurts and so forth, but you will get over it.
You will succeed in the end.
And that stuck with me for probably, I'm going to say 20 years after that.
He left such a lasting impression on me that I consider him a driving force in making me the person that I am today.
And I think as an individual who now owns his own business and has his own employees, to be able to say that about a person that you worked for, not somebody that was a part of your family or something like that is over and above anything that can ever be expected.
And if anybody has the opportunity to be able to work for an individual like this, there's no way that you can't benefit from it over time.
It's something that once you have it, you want to hold it and keep it as long as you possibly can because those type of people only come into your life very, very briefly.

Christine Laperriere:
And you have to take advantage of that.
What's so interesting about this too is that when you're working with somebody, you get hours of access to them.
So you have this lovely, he almost sounds like a father figure who is really supporting and rallying you on.
And you have a lot of access to him because you're spending your working hours, which to me is why a boss is so important.
I spend more time at work, sadly, than I get times with my family in a week.
So it's a question of you're getting that much access to that person.
It's lovely that you could get so much support.
You hit the nail on the head there.

Rick Renaud:
They are like family because you do spend seven, eight hours a day with them, five days a week or six days a week.
And you do develop, especially with this type of individual, you do develop a bond that is very similar to a father figure or a mentor.
And I considered him both, to be honest with you.

Christine Laperriere:
When I was hired, I guess he was in his late 30s.

Rick Renaud:
He had just turned 40, I guess, a few years after I started working for him.
And at the age of 20, I worked for him for almost five years before I moved on to something else.
And I don't know, it's just a very difficult thing to explain when somebody leaves that type of impression on you that it sticks with you for the rest of your life.
I'm going back almost 40 years.
I think of this man right now.
And it still brings joy and happiness to my day whenever I think of him.
And I try, now that I have my own employees, I'm trying to be the same type of person as he was with my employees.
And I can't see that being a detriment to anybody that works for me because the positive impact that it had on me as a young individual far outweighs any possible harm that it could do because it was an amazing experience.
And I know that I am a better person because of it and because of him.
And I kept in contact with him after I left the store.
We would talk weekly.
And I invited him to my wedding.
Him and his wife were both invited to my wedding.
Unfortunately, about three years ago, he passed away.
I went and visited him, myself, and a couple of other past employees that worked for him.
We went and visited him, I guess, about maybe a month before he passed away.
And he had changed drastically.
He was quite ill at the time.
He was suffering from a liver disorder.
And his mind has started to go.
He remembered us, but he couldn't remember that he sold his store.
He was asking questions, you know, is the store still open?

Christine Laperriere:
Who's running it now?

Rick Renaud:
The store has since closed and the building is no longer there.
It was very sad to see a man that was so influential in the development of who I became reduced to the shell that he was at that point.
It broke my heart to see him.
But every once in a while during our conversation that day, you would see a little glimpse of him appear now and then.

Christine Laperriere:
The jokester and the funny guy and the guy that always made you feel good.
And the guy that always had your back whenever you needed it.

Rick Renaud:
But it was very sad to see that he had been reduced to this state because he wasn't anything close to what he was when we were all working together.
And the day that I heard that one of the other employees had called me and said that he had passed away, Christine, that the sense of loss that I felt at that moment, the devastation that came over me was as if I had lost one of my own parents.
I knew it was going to affect me when I knew, you know, at that point we knew it was only a matter of time.
But when I finally got the word that he had passed away, it was an absolute shock.
We all went to his memorial.
No surprise that the hall that we were in was absolutely packed.
He had touched so many lives over the years.
He had so many people that, you know, adored him and looked up to him.
And it's just, it's sad to know that it's that time that people really realized what they had.
I'm sure he knew that he touched some people's lives over the years, but I don't think he realized how much of an impact he made on so many people.
And I'm just thinking about it now.
I'm getting, I'm getting choked up and I'm getting a little emotional about it because he was such an amazing, amazing individual to work with.
And I dearly, dearly miss him to this day.
Almost as much as I miss my own father who passed away almost 10 years ago.
It's a fantastic experience to have.
And I am so glad that I had the opportunity to work for such an amazing individual.
But it's, yeah, it was, it's bittersweet at the end.

Christine Laperriere:
It is, but, you know, I guess to me, maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but like what a powerful use of a life.
Like what a powerful way to make an impact.

Rick Renaud:
You know, there's, there's an old saying that I, that I've heard many, many times over the years is in a hundred years from now, it won't matter what kind of car you drive, how big a house you have, or how much money you have in your bank.
What will matter is the impact that you've had on the people around you.

Christine Laperriere:
Now, I'm imagining this is the question that's coming for you next.
But, you know, when you talk about his leadership impacting the type of leader you are, like this is where to me, these are called the butterfly effect, right?
So one person leads, they show you how it can be done and you lead the same way.
So if he had impact over all those people packed at his memorial and they all changed their behavior just a little bit as a reflection of having known him, like, wow, what a powerful impact.

Rick Renaud:
He, yeah, there's no question in my mind that the, the legacy that he left behind to the people that he worked with and the people that worked for him will stand the test of time.
In my view, there's no question about it.
He was a larger than life individual and I am a 100% better person today than I would have been if I had never met him.
The impact that he left on me and to this day, I still speak to his wife now and then, you know, she's, she's moved to Montreal to be closer to her kids and her grandkids now.
No, I try and keep in contact with her every once in a while and, you know, we'll chat through Facebook and stuff when we get a chance.
You're still family.

Christine Laperriere:
Exactly.

Rick Renaud:
That connection has never lost and even with, you know, past employees that we, that we all work together to this day, we still try and reach out to each other every once in a while to see how everybody's doing.
And, you know, when we do get a chance, we like to get together for a meal and just have a few laughs and enjoy each other's company.
But yeah, it was an amazing experience.
And I think today a lot of young people may not have that opportunity because those types of individuals are very few and far between.
And I think if you ever get a chance to work for an individual who gives you not only the opportunity, but the capacity to do things on your own and to make mistakes and to learn from them and to grow is a learning experience that you will never get in school, that you will never have anywhere else.
If you do find yourself in a situation where you're working for somebody who you may look up to or may look to for guidance, by all means cherish that relationship because you never know when it's going to end and you never know when that experience is going to benefit you later on in life.
I always try and explain to my employees that we work together as a team.
There is no hierarchy in my company.
We all have the same goal and we all have the same work to do.
And if you find yourself in a situation where you find it's too challenging or you don't have the answers, don't feel like you're a failure for reaching out to me for advice because that's what I'm here for.
And I look forward to those conversations where we can brainstorm as a team and come up with a solution to a situation.
And he was the reason why that is the way I am today because that's the way he treated us and that's the way that we work together.
And so far I think my employees are quite happy with the way things are going and I hope that everybody ever has a chance to be able to have that experience as I did.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
That's absolutely amazing.
And I guess I have one more question.
You know, in my world, obviously, I spend a lot of time hands-on with leaders trying to help them develop some best boss ever skills.
And so one of the questions that comes up every time a company makes an investment in a leader to help them grow, there's always this question around return on investment, right?
So I like to ask anybody that's worked for a best boss ever, what do you think the impact on the business was?
What was the impact on the numbers or the impact on...
You know, to me, it's not just...
I mean, not only is it this incredible feeling of the father figure that you experienced, but it's good for business too.
It's a win-win.
So I'm just curious.
Can you tell me what you think the financial impact or maybe even the benefits of the business, what did they experience?

Rick Renaud:
Well, I think the benefit to the financial aspect of things, I think, was we did work hard for him.
It was not a chore to do because we wanted to do it because he empowered us to make those decisions and to succeed.
And when the business succeeded, we succeeded because he treated us as if we were a very important part to that business.
In many cases, we were because we were the day-to-day face of that business.
The way we treated his customers reflected on him.
And we took pride in providing that customer service that was the keystone to success back then.
You got to think, this is a time before big box stores like, you know, Best Buy and so forth.
There were a number of little ma and pa shops like this in all of the national capital region.
And the only thing that differentiated you from the other was how you treated your customer and how you related to them after the sale.
It's great, you know, you go to Best Buy and you buy, you know, whatever component it is, a receiver, a TV, whatever.
As soon as you walk out that door, that transaction is over.
You're just a number to them today.
Whereas back then, your customers were part of your success.
You catered to them.
You went out of your way to go the extra mile.
You followed up with them after the sale to see if everything was well, if they had any questions.
You don't get that today.
And it wasn't a chore for us to do that because it reflected back on the company that we admired.
We were loyal to that person because he treated us as if we were part of the business's success.

Christine Laperriere:
The customer experience was bar none.

Rick Renaud:
Was the keystone of any successful retail store back then was how you treated your customer.
You know, today's world is so detached, you know, with online purchases and so far.
There's no customer connection anymore.
You buy it on Amazon.
You buy it on whatever website you can think of.
The transaction is over.
You got your product, that's it.
There's no after sales service like there was back then.
And I'm not saying that today is a bad thing.
It's just evolution.
It's just the way things progress.
But there is some aspects of that time that we may feel sorry that we don't have anymore as the future unfolds and as we, you know, progress and develop and become more autonomous in our daily lives.
But I still see right now in this world, to your point, I mean, I think an interesting conversation is I see a huge opportunity still for small business.
I, for example, have hired, you know, a landscaping company and they have been phenomenal.
And you can almost sense this really strong positive culture and they're coming out to do yard work, which, you know, I got to tell you, like, not a lot of people are excited about a job doing yard work.
It's not a very, very glamorous task.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
It's tough, right?
And but meanwhile, you just see that this team is happy and this team is high functioning and this team is, you know, they are on the ball and, you know, just again walked into the house the other day and looked around and went like, you know, all the detail work was done well and thoughtfully and it was just like, it's a different experience.
You know, I haven't interviewed them yet, but I just kind of think to myself, there's something different about that team than the experiences I've had in the past.

Rick Renaud:
It's funny you bring up that point, the landscaper.
I actually had somebody, my wife and I have a rental property as well and I had a landscaper come in and do some yard cleanup and so forth at that place and they did such a great job that I brought them over to our house to do some springtime landscaping.
They aerated and detached my lawn and I said, just do the front yard.
I said, we don't need the backyard done.
Well, he did the front yard, but he also did the backyard at no charge.
When I came out and I said, you did the backyard too.
He says, yeah.
He said, listen, you guys have been great to us.
You know, we did all that work over your other property and, you know, we appreciate the business and we appreciate the fact that you trust us that I just did it at no charge.
Don't worry about it.
You know, it's that type of service and that type of action that goes a long way in the future because if anybody in my circle of friends or family says, hey, I'm looking for somebody to do some tree pruning or something right away, I know exactly who they need.
So they're going to get repeat business from me through my network of individuals.
It's just you're paying it forward.
So you're going to get the benefit of that type of service later on.
You're going to get repeat business.
You're going to get new clients.
It's just the nature of the game.
Word of mouth is a very powerful marketing tool.
And I still think that there's an incredible demand for small business and there's an incredible, it's going to look different.
Like you said, over time, it's changed.
It is going to look very different, but those niche little stores and those niche little areas, those small towns off the beaten path, you are going to get some phenomenal customer service and some fantastic experiences.
Yeah, you might pay a little bit more, but in the long run, it's going to benefit you a lot more because you're going to have that experience and you're going to feel good about your process.
It's not going to be a faceless corporation that you're looking at.
It's going to be somebody's family business that provides them with the meals on the table and the after-school activities that the kids do.
It's very important and it's the backbone, I think, to our society.
Small business is the backbone to our economy.
Without them, our economy would collapse overnight.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
I am a giant advocate for small business.
And to your exact point, I will buy from an entrepreneur over a large company when I can, when it makes sense.
I appreciate the in-person transaction and the opportunity for something, just like you said, like I really, or I want to buy from companies also that employ best bosses that are having that impact on their people.
If I know, for example, that a large business is very thoughtful about that, it means something to me because we're not just running a business where all we care about is the stock value.
We're also running a business where we actually care about the impact the business has on the people.

Rick Renaud:
That's right.
And as an employer, there's also that level of responsibility that you have to your employees.
They rely on you for an income.
So you better make sure that you're doing the right thing to protect their income for the long haul because they're relying on you for that rent payment or that mortgage payment or that grocery bill that you do every week.
So it's a big responsibility to have employees, but you got to make sure that you're doing the right thing to your clients and your customers to be able to sustain that for the long haul.
Because if you shut down your doors tomorrow, you don't only affect your bottom line, but you affect all the bottom lines of everybody that works for you.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, listen, Rick, do you have any last words of wisdom, tips, anything that you want to share with everybody?
I mean, I hear a lot of aspiring leaders, ones who are trying to be best bosses hear this show and get some inspiration from it.
Any final thoughts for them?

Rick Renaud:
I think the only advice that I can give anybody, and this is the best advice that I can possibly offer is treat people the way you want to be treated and the sky's the limit.
You will succeed.
It's just, it's as simple as that.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
Thank you, Rick.
This has been an awesome conversation.
I really appreciate it.

Rick Renaud:
Christine, it's my pleasure and I'm glad I had the opportunity to speak with you today.

Title: Encouraging my personality to shine
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Risa Crandall

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have on the show, Risa Crandall, and I'm thrilled that I have her on the show because she saw on LinkedIn some of the great work we're doing around the best boss ever, and she reached out because it inspired a story about her best boss.
These are some of my favorite types of podcasts because somebody's thinking about that person.
As soon as they see those words, best boss ever, they're like, oh, I have one of those.
So, Risa, I'm so glad have you on the show.
Please just give a 30-second introduction so everybody knows who you are.

Risa Crandall:
That's great.
Well, thank you for having me, Christine.
I'm excited to be here as well.
Yes, my name is Risa Crandall.
I have been working in the digital marketing and media arena for over 20 years now.
Currently, I work at a Key Technologies, and I'm just enjoying the journey.
It's been a fantastic role for me, and it is one environment that has prompted me to think differently, think back to my best boss, and that's why it really sparked when I saw what you were doing.

Christine Laperriere:
Lovely.
So I'm going to dive in.
Tell us who is your best boss ever and why.

Risa Crandall:
Yeah, great.
So my best boss was Barbara Littrell.
What really made her a best boss is that she was someone who was very experienced and had grown up in the industry in a kind of a rigid formula as far as how you got started, how you got to the next spot, what you say, what you do, even what you wear.
And when I encountered working for her back over 20 years ago, she didn't embrace those things any longer or didn't, now that she was in a much higher leadership role, really decided to kind of think upon Soul Search herself to see what really made her successful and what she wanted to share with her kind of new and up-and-coming teammates, and I was one of them.
And she just really was the spark to enjoying what I do and being really passionate about my career.
That was at the New York Times when we started together.
So again, a very formal beginning, but she brought that personality and that spark to the role and again, really encouraged us to be individual and to embrace who we are, which really was a highlight of getting to know her in the early days.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me what that was like.
So, you know, like, you know, what do you say and what do you wear?
And, you know, how does it look when you have a team of people kind of their individuality versus, let's say, trying to conform?

Risa Crandall:
Yeah.
And so at that time, it was even more challenging than I feel it is today, because then there was a model, right?
As far as who would succeed and how you really, you know, went to market, you know, with a very structured, now this is back before everything was so digital.
So your presentation, for example, was built for you.
There was no flexibility in it.
So in order to create, and I remember her bringing me into her office the very first time we were going to go out on the road together.
And she was, you know, again, quite senior to me.
I was not intimidated by her because she had just this wonderful open nature about her.
But we sat down to prep for the meetings.
And again, we had this, this set presentation.
It was very stead.
There was no flexibility in it.
And when we were walking through it and kind of deciding roles and responsibilities for the share, she said to me, you know, what's really important is to bring your personality to it, Risa.
You really want to have the people that we're talking to see the passion, see why we are different, get the words off the page so that it comes to life.
And so by bringing your personality to it, you're going to be successful.
And then dovetailing with me, also a very passionate person, I'm going to take that energy forward as well.
I am going to be really highlighting things that I know will spark to these clients.
And again, bringing it off the page.
And that just gave me that early, the early confidence to do that, to not just follow a script, but bring in the personality, bring in my style.
And she always embraced that from that very first time we sat down together and planned for that trip all the way through to the six years that we worked together.
That's amazing.
So what is your personality?
Like help me out.
What do you think you were trying to bring forward that like, I'm curious, I can see how it'd be autopilot, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Those, you know, it'd just be almost like just reading a script and people would go, well, any monkey can read a script, right?

Risa Crandall:
That's right.
I've always had a big personality.
I have always had a lot of energy, a lot of passion.
I feel that what you do in life, not only in work, you should be passionate about, right?
We should embrace what we're doing.
It doesn't mean we'd like to wash the dishes, for example, but just do it with some vim and vigor, you know, just get it done with a positive attitude.
So at that time, too, at the New York Times, it was again, very traditional environment.
And she really embraced having that, that spark to the way that we present and connect with clients and go off script and really tell stories and be a rich storyteller about what we could do at the New York Times that would really help pivot their business or give them an additional opportunity to brand and move sales across.
So we sat together, we did rehearse it, but in a very loose conversational way.
So again, it had, it had some breathing space and we talked about how telling stories is going to connect much better than just following the bullet points on a slide and hoping that someone's connecting to it.
We really talked about how the storytelling piece of it was something that would be much more successful than what had been done in the past, as far as staying to a very strict script.

Christine Laperriere:
I agree completely.
I mean, I spent 10 years working on sales transformation and one of the best things you can do is help people picture value through storytelling.
It definitely doesn't conform sometimes because that story's got to be real to you.
Sometimes you can't script a story, right?
You know, it needs to be coming from the heart.
So any other stories about Barbara from that best boss perspective?

Risa Crandall:
Yeah.
So if you do one is in particular, we decided to go out to see the Hershey's clients out in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
We were granted a meeting, which wasn't easy to get.
And we said, we're going to go out there and we have this new solution.
It was all about parenting, which of course Hershey cares a lot about parents.
And we said, let's get out there and just, we've got to go in person.
That was another thing that Barbara really instilled in me is if you can be there in person rather than any other form of communication, you're going to be more successful.
So we're going to get in the car and we're going to drive on out there.
The three hours, four hour drive.
She lived two hours further than I.
So she said, but she was a very early morning person like me.
That's what we also really think.
So she said, I'm going to drive on over and pick you up.
I was living in New York City at the time.
I'm going to pick you up at four 30 in the morning.
And we're going to drive our way out there to Hershey, Pennsylvania.
We're just going to have a grand old time.
We're going to have these meetings and we're going to drive on back.
I'm going to drop you back off in the city.
And then I'm going to head out to all the way in riverhead, Long Island.
And I said, wow, that's a, that's a big day.
And I love those kind of days, but I thought, do you, would you like me to drive?
Is there anything else I could do?
Nope.
You just come and be ready.
So I got up that morning.
And what I just also marveled at too, is in that early hours that she got up to pick me up and go on this journey together, I got in her car and in the cup holder was the hot tea for me.
Cause she knew I was a tea drinker and her diet coke and in the cup holder, just sitting there without, without even words, I glanced down at the cup holder and that thoughtfulness to write, to be in her position as an SVP to me a junior salesperson.
And she prepped us for the, you know, having the morning be kind of like our routine, though it was in the car for all this time and be together.
It just set the tone.
It set the tone that it doesn't matter what your level is.
We can all do for each other.
We can all listen in and respond to each other and not to titles shouldn't get in our way, right?
From just being great human beings.
So we set off on that journey and we just, it was like a road trip of joy.
It really was talking about what we were going to do in those meetings.
And we had a set of like six meetings too.
Cause if you're going to drive all the way out there, she would say, right, we're not going there for one meeting.
Absolutely not.
And I agree.
I'm all about efficiency.
And so was she.
And so we got out there, got there early.
We got ourselves organized.
We had already, you know, really prepped on the car ride.
And we went into those meetings with our high energy cells, but very prepared and knowing what kind of, what kind of program that we were talking to them about in this parenting category, got through the meetings, got all of their feedback about what would make it happen or what would maybe get in the way.
And she took copious notes too.
Even though I was taking notes, she was taking notes for a few different things.
I sent her in the car right back.
How come you taking notes when I was taking notes?
Didn't you trust my note taking?
And she said, no, I completely trust your note taking, but I might write something down that had a different nuance than you or you, I might've caught something that while you were busy writing it down, you didn't catch.
And then that we can compare notes.
And from there, we can really look and see what this client was all about.
So again, not just relying on me to be that person in the center there, but together, it was very, very collaborative.
And we came back and we talked to the marketing team the next day, because it was a long day.
We discussed what that program was going to look like.
And again, we built it together.
And then we went back out to Hershey, Pennsylvania, two weeks later and delivered the program to them, discussed it, made it very conversational, very collaborative, and we got the program.
So that was the kind of spirit that she brought and that I've now been able to bring in my career at this point and stage in my career is roll up your sleeves and get it done.
If you can help somebody do something or you bring a different perspective or an added perspective, do it because it's only going to make the whole relationship internally even stronger.
And then what you're going to deliver to your client.
It lives with me all the time because I still am a morning person.
And I really understand and embrace kind of where she was coming from.
Another time, though, which is kind of on a different note, we decided to go down to Campbell's, down in Camden, New Jersey.
We had meetings there, very different kind of drive, but also kind of got ourselves going.
And we got there and we had a series of meetings, but one meeting was falling around just at noon.
And there was no conference rooms available and the person hadn't planned for a larger room and there was going to be a collection of people.
So the person who we were meeting with and it said, I'm going to bring the team, but what we're going to do is we're going to meet in the cafeteria.
And we thought, okay, that sounds fine.
I'm sure it's a big space because it Campbell's too based on where they're located.
There weren't a lot of convenient places for people to hop out for lunch.
So the cafeteria was really the hub.
So we said great.
And they shepherded us in there.
We got into the cafeteria and it was probably about 1145 for this 12 o'clock meeting.
The team gathers.
There's 12 of them.
And we sit down at this very long again, cafeteria style table and we pull out the flip chart.
Cause again, this is back with flip charts and we pull up a flip chart.
And just as we start to do introductions and, you know, we even pull the cover through everyone from Campbell's comes into that cafeteria for lunch.
It's lunch hour.
I will tell you exactly.
I would say Christine, it was the loudest environment.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Risa Crandall:
I could ever imagine everything from the people, the talking, the trays, the planking of the plates.
And she looked at me and I looked at her and I thought, how are we ever going to have this conversation?
Again, this is 12 people.
So they're sitting far away from us logistically.
How are we barely hear each other?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Risa Crandall:
If you were screaming, but then you're trying to have a conversation with all 12.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.

Risa Crandall:
And so we kind of gave each other this look as it to say, we're just going to dive in and we're going to project and we're going to bring our high energy.
But I could tell the was also saying, I'm here for you.
So you're literally voice is going to get tired trying to do this for a full half hour.
So I'm going to come in and I'm going to make sure that we dovetail this together and that we're successful.
I could just tell in the look what she was thinking.
I could read her thought bubble.
So I launched in and flipped over that first slide of the flip chart and did my best to project over all this crazy noise.
And then a few of the clients kind of remarked that it was loud.
And I said, you know, yes, it is, but we're going to do our best.
And if you really can't hear us, please, you know, just go like this time out and we'll do our best to kind of even project further.
But she just, she could see where I could bring that forward and then needed to pause a little bit.
And then she came in.
So it became this beautiful fluid tag teaming that was very effective for many reasons, but very effective given this challenging circumstance of presenting in this very loud environment.
And then when we left the meeting and one of the clients brought us back out to the reception area said, I don't know how you did that, but I was sitting all the way at the far end and I could hear you and you were clear and you kept your energy strong and you didn't get flustered.
You didn't, you didn't waver at all.
You both just went in with the same passion that you would have if we were in a quiet conference room on the fourth floor.
So I love this because one of the things that I think is a really interesting nuance, well, first of all, it's a great story.
It is hard to pivot that quickly on a dime.
I know I've been there and I've presented in, you know, in cafeteria spaces before so I can really understand that.
But, you know, what I think is really interesting is in the first story, I hear this example of where she's spending all this time in the car driving with you.
And I'm immediately thinking in the back of my head, full transparency, I'm thinking, oh, I'm the one that drives to the meeting alone because I want the alone time.
I want to listen to the podcast.
And if I don't have to teach anybody else, I'm thinking in the back of my head, it's my time where she took that time and instead she was coaching you and getting to know you and building rapport with you.
And then in this second example, what happens is now you two are looking at each other and you're communicating with no words.
And so you're actually able as a team to tag team each other.
And I'm just imagining all those hours of getting to know each other, driving together, spending time together.
You got to a point where you could anticipate each other.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.

Risa Crandall:
And that's a cool relationship that we don't get because and especially I think it's harder today even because we're working remote.
So like, how do you get to a point where you can you know what's coming next?
Most of us only can do that with our partners or our family members, right?
But when work environments, like when you know that person is, you know, you just make an eye contact and it's like, okay, I'm going to throw you the ball.
You're going to throw me the ball.
We got this.
We're going to, you know, and you're saying all of that without a word.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Risa Crandall:
It really is interesting.
And especially in our Zoom life, too, it does because you don't have the body language necessarily to see with your colleagues.
So, you know, with each of the members of the Aki team that I work with, and there's about 25 different salespeople.
And in my role, I'm with them very often and supporting them.
And so we each relationship is different.
I know where Caitlin's going to come in.
I know differently where Christine is going to bring a certain example to life.
I know where Marybeth is going to work, Amber.
So we've got it's about frequency too, right?
Being able to trust each other and having that frequency of cadence to know this is an opportunity that I can pop in.
Or even sometimes we might even be a little bit more overt about it.
And just the other day on a call with Amber, she said to me, Risa, can you pull up that example?
And so while she's continuing to talk, I'm pulling up the example that we know will really lock this meeting into a great place while she's talking.
We switch to my screen share, and then I can show it right on the spot.
So it's that unverbal piece of it.
But then also just being comfortable saying, could you pull that up so that we're really efficient with a client so that they don't feel like they're still wondering about something that we can really close that conversation in a positive way.
And all of those skills really came from what I learned so early on with Barbara to just be collaborative, to be cooperative, to help each other out.
And you're always going to be more successful when you can add one plus one equals six versus, you know, anybody feeling that they're kind of on an island on their own.
So I truly raise that in my role now.
And I bring so much of what she taught me to my work every day.
Oh, that's so cool.
Any other stories or examples you want to add here before I dive into any last questions for you?
Yeah, I mean, the one other that I can remember is while we were at the New York Times, she got very she was very into golf.
And I am not a golfer.
I love mini golf, but I do not like regular golf.
And so she found this opportunity for us to as a company to sponsor the LPGA.
Barbara's also very passionate about women and women in sports and women in industry, just elevating women, which I also really appreciate it.
And coming from the New York Times, which was at that time and, you know, just a very male dominated organization.
And so she found this opportunity for us to spot as a company to sponsor the LPGA and kind of dive in.
We had never done any sports marketing.
I had never done any sports marketing before.
And when it was first presented to the sales team, I remember thinking, how does what does this have to do with what we do?
You know, this is very different.
We are not adept at this.
We're going to really need to learn.
And when I asked her about it, she said, we just have to dive in.
We're going to learn as we go.
We're going to learn together and we're going to get there.
And then I felt comfortable.
There really aren't any major mistakes if you have people there to support you.
And we went out there and spoke to brands about sponsoring this LPGA event that we had.
And we were very successful very quickly in kind of round one.
And we decided to keep it a little bit more tight as far as the number of sponsors, not to overextend ourselves.
And that was her guidance as well.
And then when we hosted the event and we were up in Stratten Mountain, Vermont, and we were all kind of taking a bit of a deep breath that we had done it and it was successful.
And I said to her, how did you know this was going to really come together like this?
Because this was so different than anything we had ever done.
She said, it's really just about power, positive thinking.
I just knew we could do it.
And it just stayed with me that we pulled off something that really I don't think anybody expected us to be able to do.
Now, here were clients that we were able to spend time with again on that relationship building in a very authentic way that went on for years.
And it was just just truly gave me that understanding that anything is possible if you really put your mind to it.
And if you're also nimble and flexible that there's not only one way, right?
You might need to take a little bit of a detour over to the left and be open to that and be open to change.
And it really made a big difference in everything that I've been able to do on the side because digital is a lot about thinking one and then kind of pivoting as you go.
Brilliant.
And so when you think of the impact to the business when you work for a best boss ever.
So in my world, obviously I'm asking companies to invest in these leaders to help them be best bosses.
And the question always comes up.
What's the return on investment, Christine?
Why would I spend money on this?
So tell me, like, what do you think the impact of the business was by working with somebody like Barbara?
Yeah, I think that one of the biggest positive things that came from her approach was loyalty.
The staff did not change over.
And we all know if you have talented people, you want them to stay.
You also wanted them to be fulfilled and grow and stay with the organization not only because they're loyal, but because they're getting new career challenges.
But her approach brought loyalty.
There were many opportunities, especially in that early and mid part of my time at the New York Times where I was heavily recruited and I didn't go because I knew that the grass was right there and green and it was not going to be greener for me somewhere else.
And so I appreciated the environment I had.
I appreciated the work that I got to do and the relationship with somebody like her that I could continue learning from.
So it's really about keeping people motivated, keeping people on the team and really just having also lifelong mentors and friends in the industry that even once we both went separate ways at different companies, we've kept in touch.
And unfortunately, she passed last year and it brought back a whole flood of different emotions for me.
I had gone to see her about six years ago.
She was living in Sedona and I was so glad that I did.
But she is with me every day and that's the kind of impact she hoped to have.
And it is.
So having that kind of relationship with people and putting that effort in is a lifetime proposition.
And that's really where the reward is.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing, amazing.

Risa Crandall:
And I like to say to me this is kind of the butterfly effect of great leaders because as they influence lots of people that work for them, those people go on to be better leaders as a result.
And so I'm really passionate about this idea that it's really not just about the thing that you're doing that day.
Did you win the Hershey's business or not?
It really is not about that.
It's about leaders influenced to their surprise hundreds of people through the influence that they've had, a great leader, especially that's right.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.

Risa Crandall:
And a not so great leader can influence those people, right?
Because you can really make somebody feel awful.
And that passes along in what they think leadership is.
That's right.
And she really inspired us to be ourselves, to be who you are, be authentic.
And it's going to come through in your work and in your life.
And that was just really valuable.
And I bring that to my team.
I bring that to myself every day.
I really try to think through that, be myself.
And I will say the pandemic has also helped with that because being Zoom wise versus in person allows you even a bit more latitude to have your personality shine right through that screen.
Let people see your green kitchen.
People kind of have a little window into your life, which they didn't always have.
And I think those are really important things too.
And so just as a kind of counterbalance, when you think of a leader that did not possess all the genius that Barbara did, tell me a little bit about what that was like.
Yeah, it just felt confining.
It felt that there was this model that you needed to follow or not.
It was really it was black or white.
And I didn't fit into this person's model of how to be a sales leader, how to fit into the organization.
And unfortunately, she did nothing to help it.
She really it was just kind of her way or the highway.
And I tried to learn and adapt a bit.
And then that came to a point where I realized it's just not the right fit for me.
Like there was just too much adaptation that would have happened.
And then I would lose myself and I didn't want to do that.
So and I did reach out to Barbara during that time and asked for advice.
And she said, it's not the place for you.
You got to go.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's brilliant.
Because again, you know, I think we don't talk about this, but I'm a big advocate also on mental health.
And when you're trying to use a lot of your mental emotional real estate to conform into a box that doesn't quite fit, it's quite exhausting and it limits performance.
Right.
We never get the best performance out of people, but it's also can be very stressful and very exhausting.
It can turn into health problems and mental health problems.
So I mean, yeah, it wasn't your place, but it's just too bad that that leader couldn't have made room for you.

Risa Crandall:
Yeah, exactly.
And when it was really just a difficult time there, I went to speak to some other leaders in the organization to just ask for their advice.
What should I do?
And one, I thought very wise woman who said, you know, we really wanted you here at this company, but I think we're not ready for you.
So I don't know that we will be, but she also didn't know me as well, but just cared and could see the emotional strain it was taking on me.
And that was her way of saying you should go find something that makes you happy and that will be ready for you right now, or maybe six months.
But this is a big organization that's it's going to take a while and may never happen.
So it was the kind of the vibe I got.
I remember feeling a little disappointed, but you can't make that kind of change organizationally as one individual.
And that's really what she was saying to me, too, is go be free, go do what you do.
I wish we could value you and we do value you, but I wish we could tap into you and really.
But it's just not it's just not our time.
And I thought, well, that's also a great leader to someone who could tell you that honestly and let great talent go because it's just the synergy is not there.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, I had a very similar exit in at one point in my career.
And to be honest, it's so funny.
I kind of joked that they used to kind of hit me and say, get back in the box, get back in the box.
And then I left and started my own business.
And now I get paid very well to be out of the box.
And so it is just one of those like, you know, if you don't get too personally attached to why don't I fit, why don't I fit?
There can be such a much better road ahead.
But it is it's it's a feeling of rejection regardless of, you know, we all just feel that right.
We want to fit in and we don't want to be the one that can't fit in.

Risa Crandall:
That's right.
And that's exactly how I felt.
But then once I moved on, I was happy again.
And my skill set and my personality was fully embraced.
And, you know, it really took, you know, a few different folks to kind of have conversations with me so that I could feel comfortable with making that change and kind of controlling my destiny a little bit more than I had been during that time.
And again, a lot of it really comes down to Barbara.
And when we did get a chance to see her in Sedona and with my full family, my husband and my three kids.
And as we were leaving dinner and we sat by the red rocks and just had this fantastic dinner, my children said to me as we walked to the car in the parking lot, she's so you and you're so her.
And that just gave me the most amount of joy because to be anywhere near what Barbara is about, just that just touched my heart.

Christine Laperriere:
That's beautiful.

Risa Crandall:
What a beautiful thing to hear if your children see you as being as much as this lovely mentor was and somebody you aspired to be like.
That's, you know, you made it.
I really did.
I felt like now my wings were, you know, ready to even fly and soar higher.
And then when she did pass and I said, you know, she set me up to be who I can be.
And while I miss her, she gave me all that confidence and gave me that ability to embrace who I am and to be successful and to be positive and bring that to again, life and work.
So that was a wonderful experience to go through.
And I'm just so appreciative that I had a chance to do that and have my kids see that too, that that's what they should aspire to in their work as well is people around them that are going to be positive forces in their career and really give them those advice pieces and to support them and just give them the positive energy that's going to make them succeed in life.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, listen, this was fantastic.
Thank you so much for sharing your story.
If you have any final words of wisdom for leaders who are out there and they're trying to aspire to be a best boss, please share them.
But this has been lovely.

Risa Crandall:
Yeah, I would just say as my parting words is to just get to know people and give them that breathing room, let them be who they are.
They can be valuable members of your organization if they have their personality and they have their style.
And you could support that.
And it's a complimentary, you know, your style and their style as a boss is a compliment to each other.
They don't need to be the same.
They should be complementary to each other.
And then everybody's going to enjoy until very natural in what they do.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much, Risa.

Risa Crandall:
Thank you, Christine.

Episode: 36
Title: Inclusiveness counts
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Atul Tiwari

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I am going to interview Atul.
I'll have him introduce himself in a second.
But I'm thrilled that you accepted my invite because I worked with you at your days at Vanguard as a leader.
I got a chance to see all of the great things that you brought to that culture.
And one of the things that I always thought was impressive is when I worked at Vanguard, I always said everyone that I met was just fantastic.
There was something really unique and special about that environment.
So it made perfect sense to reach out to you and ask you if you'd be interested in coming on the show.
So thank you so much, Atul.

Atul Tiwari:
Thank you, Christine.
And I, too, really enjoyed working with you at Vanguard.
And you certainly helped us quite a bit on the sales side in terms of building a terrific sales team.
So thank you for that.
It's great to be here.
Thank you.
My background is I'm a reformed lawyer.
Started my career as a corporate securities lawyer.
And from there, went on to a number of different business roles, including starting the ETF business for Banco Montreal.
And then, as you pointed out, I was the CEO of Vanguard Canada, starting up Vanguard here.
So it's been it's been a lot of fun throughout my career.
And after Vanguard, I was thinking about what to do next.
And I'm very passionate about fine wine.
My wife is as well.
She was the head of the fine wine department at Ritchie's Auction House.
And I always knew that fine wine investing was something that was established in Europe and in Asia.
But it hadn't really been done in North America.
And so I built a business plan, reached out to the company that's the best in the world at doing this called Cult Wines.
And we set up a joint venture.
And from there in Canada and from there, I've now taken on the role of overseeing the U.S., Caribbean and Latin America as well.
So it's it's a lot of fun building a business.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm only going to tell you, I'm just slightly jealous.
So when I saw that you went into fine wine, first of all, I knew that about you as a passion.
So that felt right on brand.
And and also, I just I'm only slightly jealous because it's got to be a delicious job.

Atul Tiwari:
Yes, well, it's it's a lot of fun.
And, you know, somebody had said to me that if you can make your passion, your occupation, you'll never work another day in your life.
And I really feel that way.
It's it's just wonderful kind of marrying your interests of, in my case, fine wine and asset management.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
We're going to dive in.
Tell us about the best boss that you ever had, or even if there were a few do share with us a little bit about what your experience has been.

Atul Tiwari:
There's definitely been a few.
And I've been fortunate through my career to have some wonderful bosses and, by the way, some not so wonderful bosses, which I think will as well.
But absolutely, you know, the best part, I think, of having experienced a number of different styles and leaders is you can learn from them and you can sort of select what you're going to become as a leader.
I think early in my career, I was fortunate because I had a boss who really took a lot of time with me to to teach me.
We would spend literally hours in his office with him imparting his knowledge about the investment industry to me.
So as a lawyer, it was important because I learned a lot more about the business, which makes you a better lawyer if you understand what your clients are experiencing and doing day to day.
So absolutely, I would say mentorship and sharing knowledge.
Those are traits, I think, of great leaders and great bosses.
My best boss ever, I would say, sort of embodies all of that.
And he was a very senior leader at BMO, Nesbitt Burns, Bank of Montreal.
He just was an incredible and is an incredible human being.
Just very kind, very experienced, always had your back.
No matter what what happened, he was he was in your corner and you knew that.
So you could take some risks knowing that that he was going to stand by you sort of thing.
And he was known around the company as as a leader that everybody wanted to work for.
And so I always felt fortunate to be working for him and reporting to him.
And people would always say, oh, you're so lucky.
I wish I was working for him.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
He had that draw.
So he had actually a magnetism where people were like, you're in a coveted position if you work for this boss.

Atul Tiwari:
That's right.
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you give me some stories and examples a little bit of what you remember from that time?

Atul Tiwari:
The one that really stands out is when I moved from being a lawyer to taking on a management role, my first role was to head up the mutual fund division for Bank of Montreal in Chicago, Harris Bank.
And so, you know, it was a big step for me just transitioning into a role like that.
And it was a bit of an interesting situation in that the previous head had been terminated for the independent board, having lost confidence in him.
So I was put in essentially as a turnaround situation and getting ready for my first meeting was interesting.
I had prepared a lot and was ready to talk about how we're going to turn things around.
And when we got into the meeting, my voice was shaking.
I just thought, oh, goodness, because it was a pretty high profile, big meeting.
And I pulled it together eventually, but obviously was nervous.
And so after the meeting, I spoke to my boss and I said, sorry, you know, I don't know what happened there at the beginning.
But, you know, I did turn it around.
And, you know, he said something that really just made me feel good.
Which was, you know what, that's all you're passionate about this.
And, you know, you're not going to go into a meeting being a robot.
You know, you're a human being coming in and expressing yourself the way you did, showed that you care.
And, you know, it was that's just sort of what he was like.
He always kind of found the good in anything and made you feel good.

Christine Laperriere:
I like that because that's such a good example.
I actually it made me smile when you said that because I remember meeting you for the first time and being nervous.
And, you know, it's it's funny because I do remember how disarming you are.
You're you know, you don't give off that impression of you should be nervous.
Right.
Like, so all of a sudden, a few minutes into our conversation, it was like, OK, he doesn't he doesn't need me to be nervous right now.
I just remember that.
And when we first met, because, you know, just because of that perception of status or that nervousness that that comes.

Atul Tiwari:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
So that's neat that you bring that now to how you lead, where it's like you're a human, not a robot.

Atul Tiwari:
Absolutely.

Atul Tiwari:
And, you know, there's no need to be different at work than you are in your day to day life, I think.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
Any other things that you can think of that, you know, as you were working for this leader, I think that's a great example.
Other things that come to mind.

Atul Tiwari:
Yeah, I would just say, you know, I learned a lot from him about developing people.
And to me, again, as a great leader, that is not just something you do.
I think it's an obligation.
And so he was known for having developed a number of great leaders around BMO.
And so I think that is something that I took with me as well throughout the rest of my career, which was, you know, you really need to take an interest in the people that work with you.
You know, help coach, develop.
Those are important things.
And so I think that was another element that has influenced me, I think, over time.
The other part of it is just inclusiveness.
And I think he was inclusive before it was trendy, you know, to be inclusive.
He's, you know, a white male who's had a terrific career in life.
But, you know, he was very open in terms of the people that were around his table from a management standpoint.
And for me personally, I benefited from him bringing me into settings and surroundings that I wouldn't naturally be in.
And so when I talk about my passion for fine wine, it was Barry was a member of an ice golf club.
You know, he himself is very, very passionate about wine and very knowledgeable.
So not just working for him or with him, but also just how he included me in certain events with his wine group, for example, where you got to experience some fine wines that I had never experienced before.
And quite frankly, as a person of color, often I would be the only person of color at those events.
But, you know, that's something that I definitely also think I took from him, which was, you know, when you have the ability to include people in things that they naturally may not have been part of and to help either educate them around it or if they're interested, you know, coax their interests.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great.
That's important.
And that's so interesting because I didn't even think of that until you just said it, but that feeling of, you know, being included at a time when you didn't, you know, like you said, it probably wasn't trendy yet.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So you might not have always went to environments and felt as included.

Atul Tiwari:
That's right.
Yeah, absolutely.
And so, you know, to have somebody as a mentor who brings you along in those types of environments is important.
I mean, and that's, you know, that's something I think all leaders should pay attention to.
I think we've talked about this before as well, which is, you know, whether you're a person of color or a female, you know, you're your mentor or the people that you work for or with.
It's important that they include you in those social settings, like outside of work, because that's, you know, let's face it.
That's where a lot of discussions happen and other leaders get to know you better and then will naturally promote you along the way.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Very something interesting about what you just shared as well.
So, you know, the making connections in a social setting or in a social way, right, like building friendships.
I just remember distinctly when we were working on some of the cultural pieces.
And one of the things that scored really well on the team that that we both worked with was that the engagement question.
I have a best friend at work and that one scored incredibly high.
And I remember thinking how interesting that was, just given the fact that the culture felt so unique and different.
So it's again, very interesting to me to hear that correlation or that tie back to the fact that somebody made you feel like a friend.

Atul Tiwari:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Versus just a colleague.

Atul Tiwari:
Yes, absolutely.
It's that's a good feeling.
And quite frankly, you work harder for somebody like that because you feel like you're invested in the business and clients and success, not just for yourself, but also for your team and for your leader.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's that's huge.
So then tell me a little bit about your experiences of the not so great bosses.
Like, what did they do that that left a mark and shaped the way you think about leadership?

Atul Tiwari:
Well, it's almost the opposite of everything I just said.
And one boss in particular, and I won't say the name, was somebody who, no matter what you did, would make you feel like you did something wrong.
And even, you know, even if it was right, you squirmed because you thought, oh, boy, you know, he's going to come at me with this or that.
And you never felt like you were on the same side.
It really felt like you were being grilled for a reason.
And, you know, in particular, one of my colleagues made a call and actually made the wrong call.
And he called the entire department in and berated her for having made the call she made.
And there was an economic impact due to the call that she made.
And basically, he said, you're going to be paying that back.
And, you know, she was more of a junior person.
And so those of us who were maybe a little more senior kind of stepped in and said, come on, that's, you know, that's that's not right.
We're a team, et cetera, et cetera.
But, you know, that's the kind of thing that would happen.
And it was it was a it was essentially a toxic environment.
And you could hear him sometimes, you know, with the door closed, basically yelling at some of your colleagues.
And it was not a good environment at all.
So I would say, you know, that's sort of the exact opposite, which is rather than always feeling like your your boss has your back.
In that case, it was, you know, you were scared.
You walked around on eggshells.

Christine Laperriere:
Like you said, it's almost the opposite.
You're waiting for your boss to stab you in the back.

Atul Tiwari:
That is exactly right.

Christine Laperriere:
The look over your shoulder at all times.

Atul Tiwari:
The hard part for somebody who has a boss who's insecure is that sometimes, you know, your boss, because they're insecure and maybe don't feel confident in their position, they want more control.
And, you know, that's a difficult situation because they do like to control information.
So I had a boss, you know, she she was very much that way.
And previous to that boss, you know, had a lot of interaction with very senior people.
But then when that boss came in, she said, OK, anything you send by email or otherwise to these senior people, you got to put it through me first.
Right.
And then you kind of get the sense that obviously she's controlling the message.
Right.
And I I don't think that's a good approach.
I think no matter who you are in an organization, the channels of communication should be open.
It shouldn't be filtered.
You know, and as a leader, you want that.
You want to hear from people whether it's a good thing or not a good thing.
Because, you know, obviously, if it's not a good thing, you can work on making that better.
But if you don't hear that, you won't know.

Christine Laperriere:
I can tell you right now, there's a lot of people listening to that and they can resonate with that.
So the controlling of information is a very interesting one because it doesn't look as obvious as yelling at somebody or berating somebody.
It's a much more like you said, it's driven from insecurity.
And it's very subtle because it doesn't feel as obvious and as wrong as the example you gave earlier.
Right.
But in the same breath, I see that at a lot of people.
They feel that right.
They feel not trusted.
They don't feel valued.
They don't feel brought in as the team.
So with the controlling of information really does kind of like break down a team, but it's so much more subtle because it doesn't feel, you know, it doesn't feel as obvious.

Atul Tiwari:
That's right.
And it's not an open environment.
And I think you need to sort of foster an open environment where people feel like they can, you know, express their opinions in a constructive way.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that's great.
So, you know, one of the questions that I always love to ask leaders.
So obviously, in my business, I'm an added expense.
Right.
As I work on the culture and I work on the people and the development of leaders.
And so I always try to understand.
I get this question.
What's the return on investment?
Right.
And so what do you think the impact is to the bottom line when you're working for a best boss ever or you're working for somebody who really is aspiring to operate at that level?

Atul Tiwari:
Yeah.
Well, look, I've never thought of you as an added expense.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you.

Atul Tiwari:
You pay for your your your services and help by, you know, building much better sales teams.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And obviously does go to the bottom line.
So yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean, it's hard to say, Christine.
I mean, you know, there's a lot of intangibles there.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And it's hard to actually point to a bottom line impact of great leadership.
I mean, I think I think all of the things we've talked about just sort of make for a better environment for for people to, you know, work as a team to build a better business and service clients better.
And ultimately that translates to bottom line, I think.
So I'm not sure there's a direct you can't sort of measure it.
It's just something I think that we know it's it's an intuitive thing.
Well, now I can say that another really smart person also said the same thing, because that's I run into a similar answer where I'm always like, it's intangible, but it's felt.
And so even though we'll never be able to do a split and say, OK, here's what the business numbers would be without great leaders and here's the business numbers with great leaders, we're never going to be able to really have those two scenarios side by side.
But what I do know is just what you said.
When you build an environment that helps people perform at a much higher rate, the impact is there.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Atul Tiwari:
And you know, and you can almost make an analogy to marketing, right, which is it's a constant tension between what do you spend to build your brand versus you spend to acquire clients.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And there's no right answer to that.
It's it's just, you know, that you have to spend something to build your brand.
It's intangible.
You don't know what that return is, but you know, you have to do it.
It's felt exactly, especially when it's not there.
When there's a vacuum of it, it's very noticeable, too.
You know, so it's interesting when you mention this, because it's it's always this I feel like one day we're going to be able to analyze or understand the numbers, but it's very tricky to actually put exact dollars to these things.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.
Yeah, that's great.
So if you are going to teach or advise future leaders, the best part is that all kinds of people that I work with today listen to the show for different ideas and insights to be a better leader.
So if you were going to teach or advise them, what would be some words of wisdom or things that you would ask them to think about as we wrap this show up?

Atul Tiwari:
Well, I actually had somebody tell me early in my career that it's important to listen.
That kind of always stuck with me.
And so I think active listening is an important skill set.
Not everybody has it.
I think it kind of goes hand in hand with taking an interest in the people that you work with and understanding their motivations, understanding what drives them in life, you know, what makes them happy, what makes them unhappy.
And so I think that is an important trait to develop, you know, your active listening skills.
Sort of beyond that, I guess, you know, the other part of it that maybe goes with that is the empathy, right?
We all know that there are tough decisions that have to be made in business from time to time.
But, you know, you can always do things in an empathetic way.
And I think as we started the conversation, you know, you have to remember, look, we're all human beings.
We're all people with feelings.
And I think it's important to respect those.
And I think, you know, both of those sound both of those pieces of wisdom you just shared, they sound easy at first glance, but they're quite powerful when implemented.
That's kind of what I would say, because, you know, listening is such an interesting one.
People perceive silence is equating to listening.
It's definitely not.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Atul Tiwari:
There's a quality, right?
And look, we've all been in meetings where we've had the people who come in and talk the loudest and the longest and kind of like hearing the sound of their voice.
But I think there's there's power in listening.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Atul Tiwari:
And then that piece around empathy, too, which, you know, I think it gets lost quickly when especially I mean, you're in businesses where numbers matter.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And so you're always looking at numbers and, you know, financials and, you know, dollars and cents.
So it's trying to be able to balance the fact that the numbers are not the only story.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.
Absolutely.
Well, listen, thank you so much for giving me this time.
Do you have anything else that you want to share today just as people are listening?

Atul Tiwari:
No, I think we we covered a lot of issues in the short period of time, Christine.
So once again, just thank you for for having me.
And it's been a fun discussion.
And hopefully some of the people who listen to this may may pick up something from from what we've been talking about.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's part of the giving back and sharing your experiences.
Amazing.
And then they should go find you on LinkedIn as the CEO of Colt Wines.

Atul Tiwari:
Absolutely.
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
They want to find out more about investing in top end wine.
They should come follow you, right?

Atul Tiwari:
But it's it's the place to come, for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Atul Tiwari:
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Christine.

Title: Lift heavaily as you climb
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jennifer Laidlaw

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast.
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and today I've asked Jennifer Laidlaw to join me for an interview.
Now, Jennifer, I've got a chance to meet with you in your days at CIBC, and we had some really powerful conversations about the 30% club and the work you're doing in the diversity and inclusion space.
And I really admired your passion to changing culture and building more equitable cultures.
And so for me, it was just a natural progression to ask you if I could learn a little bit more about you in respect to what you've experienced in leadership over the years.
Thank you for joining me.
And can you introduce yourself real quick?

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yeah, thank you so much, Christine.
I am so pleased to be here.
Hello to all the listeners out there.
So currently I'm doing an executive in residence at the Toronto Metropolitan University and country head of 30% club here in Canada.
I've held several executive roles in a variety of sectors, including a large Canadian regulator, a bank, and within the Ontario Public Service.
And more recently, I've been working with leaders to leverage an understanding of what I'm calling an invisible success factor, which I say is state of mind, to transform performance and business outcomes, unlock creativity and innovation and uncover resilience.
It's been a lot of fun.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And we would definitely agree, I think state of mind is a invisible success factor.
I like the way that you phrase that.
So I'm just gonna dive right in.
So tell us a little bit about the best bosses that you've worked for and some of the experiences that you've had with them.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yeah, such a pleasure to look back over the years.
I've had some incredible leaders throughout my career.
So I'm just gonna focus on a couple of key elements of a few that really stood out for me.
They have really inspired and enabled greatness and supported me and their teams in building the conditions for our success and that of our teams and our colleagues.
And the first one that I'd like to start with is what I would call purpose driven leadership.
And I know purpose recently has gotten a lot of attention, but there are two leaders in particular that I worked with over the years that were masters at aligning the organization to purpose.
Each of them had joined their organizations and those organizations benefited significantly and surprisingly quickly from their immediate focus and sort of re-attention on their own purpose, but also uncovering and recommitting to the purpose of the organization with the entire team.
They also were then incredibly bold in leveraging purpose as a guiding light for strategy development and execution.
They made very difficult decisions that were informed by this process and made investments in key areas that were required to live out that purpose.
For both of them, status quo was not an option.
And I have to say, Christine, there was literally a buzz to the place in each organization that you could feel.
They essentially infused life back into the organizations and it was because they cared so much about the critical importance of the work that they were leading.
And I would say just, this is legacy work.
Purpose-driven work becomes legacy work.
And that's what I saw in these two leaders and it was very inspiring.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you tell me just a bit about, what did you see in their purpose?
What were they passionate about?

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Well, in each situation, they were passionate about essentially bringing attention back to what the point of the organization was.
And the impact that it would have.
And in each situation, it was not about creating purpose.
It was uncovering the original purpose of the organization and then recommitting to that purpose.
And what it did was, it created a really clear sort of decision factor.
Everything became more clear, not necessarily more easy, but certainly more clear about what was required of the organization, where the resources needed to be, where the investments needed to be had, where shifts needed to be made in order to have the impact that that organization was originally designed to have.

Christine Laperriere:
That's interesting when I think about that, uncovering the original purpose of the organization and then recommitting to what that is gonna be.
I can picture that because it seems that so many organizations kind of lose their way.
They're trying to be too many different things.
I guess you can feel that a lot of the times in the way that you even experience in organizations where it's like they're trying to be too many things or they've lost their way.
They're too focused on profit and they've lost the customer connection and they've lost the connection to people in their environment at work.
So I can really see how that in itself would be so purposeful, right?

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yes, exactly.
And in one situation, when you're working with a regulator, it's very complex, but the intention is really quite simple and it's protecting the people of the province and therefore of the country.
And so getting back to that, really clarifying.
For the bank, that particular bank, it was about the original purpose really stemmed from the fact that it was one of the first financial institution to make lending available to regular folks versus business.
And it was about how do we enable regular people, all people to have access to what they need to make the best out of their lives.

Christine Laperriere:
That is very profound.
You know, I don't think of organizations thinking of everyday people.
I can see why that would energize people, right?
Because it's probably so many people that work in the organization are those everyday people trying to make the most out of their lives.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Exactly.
And recommitting to that sense of, this is why we're doing this work.
Because it's easy to see the outcomes and it's easy to see what is talked about in media or the big deals and those kinds of things.
But those are the aspects that actually fuel the organization to be able to deliver its purpose to everyone.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow, I like that.
That's sending off some light bulbs for me.
So that's really cool.
So tell me a little bit more.
Can you think of any examples of what it's like to be in a meeting or be in a discussion or tell me like how a team solves a problem when they're in an organization working with a really wonderfully purpose-driven leader?

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yeah, I think it comes down to where you put purpose in the conversation.
And it is something that you can use as a guiding light.
And so I think when you're asking yourself, is this aligned with purpose?
It makes it, again, really clear, but not necessarily easy.
And so when you're having a conversation about how resources are to be invested in, that's a difficult conversation.
But if you keep the end in mind, are we ensuring that the organization is positioned in the best way possible to be able to deliver on what we say and what we agreed and what we've committed to with our purpose, then those hard decisions become more clear, not necessarily more easy, but they become more clear.
And it is about paving a pathway forward.

Christine Laperriere:
So it feels like it helps people when they're debating big, complicated decisions, like it helps create that center point or that referee, right?
You come back to the...

Jennifer Laidlaw:
And a couple of, again, very high level examples, but in one organization, the decision to actually invest in a strategic plan at a time when the organization had a very uncertain future, there were a lot of points of view about that.
And some were thinking that maybe an investment wasn't the right way to go.
But when we came back to purpose, the purpose was to ensure that the organization was the best positioned to be able to deliver on its purpose in whatever uncertain future it was.
And so it really was the responsible decision to make sure that we were going to be able to essentially hand off the best organization possible for whatever sort of future was determined for it by making sure that we had done the work to actually prepare the organization to go through that process.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
That makes so much sense.
And that's really, that locks in that internal alignment so you get people there faster, right?
So that's amazing.
You know, one of the questions that comes up in my world, so I work with a lot of different leaders and I'm helping them navigate a lot of different challenges and people ask, what's the return on investment when you invest in your people and you help build some of those best bosses?
So I'd love to know in your perspective, when you think of how strong these leaders were that you worked for, what do you think the return to the bottom line was?

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yeah, and you know, the leaders that I've been able to work with are quite high level and so their impact has been incredibly wide and deep.
And in two instances, they were able to show that in fact, one person can spark a huge shift in culture.
They can't do it alone, but they can certainly spark it.
And I think that, and then seeing just the feeling, the buzz in the organization completely shift from an energy perspective, it's palpable.
Like you don't need to have measurements to experience it, but obviously measurement is really important.
And I think, you know, as we've gone through what we're calling the great resignation or whatever way you prefer to reference it, the bottom line is that we're not getting engagement and resilience and trust right.
And I think that's one of the things that I would point to that leaders really need to be aware of and engaging with.
And I'll refer to an article that I think is really compelling that's out of ADP Research Institute and Marcus Buckingham's associated with a lot of that work.
And if you haven't read his book, Love and Work, it's a collaboration with Harvard Business Review.
You can also see an article in that magazine about it.
It is profoundly impactful, but they did the study in 2018 with 19,000 workers in 19 countries.
And the results are shocking.
And this was pre-pandemic.
The pandemic actually dropped scores by 2%.
So really quickly, I'll go through them.
Only 18% of workers are fully engaged, which means that, and now that's 16%, which means that there are 84% of your workforce population that are less than fully engaged.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Only 17% feel highly resilient, which means that 83% do not.
What does that matter?
That means turnover, that means absenteeism, that means hard to hire because you've got so many open spaces.
Another one that I thought was really interesting, which is 14% of these workers trusted their team leader and their senior leader, 14, which means that 86% of our workers don't trust their team leader and their senior leader, which has huge implications to innovation, to commitment to the organization, whether they'll stay, whether they'll go.
And we know that one quarter of US workers quit their jobs in 2021, which is a historic high.
So I would say, Houston, we have a problem.
Every single leader should be aware of these numbers and developing strategies to ensure they make a significant positive impact on their teams.
And best bosses are in the game.
They're great leaders.
They're developing environments and culture in which their team members are fully engaged.
They're highly resilient and they have trust in their leaders and teams.

Christine Laperriere:
I love what you're sharing because first of all, I guess I don't have the numbers, but I've always felt what you've said.
I've seen those reports with Gallup.
I've seen those reports where they have said some really upsetting numbers, very similar, and probably smaller groups.
And the other thing that I find is that on the diversity and inclusion front, when I started tackling that problem, one of the biggest challenges I saw is that organizations figured out how to recruit great diverse talent, but because they were going to work for lousy leaders, the 14% that trusted their team and their leader, right?
So that means that we've got 86% that are walking around that don't trust their leader.
What I find is that, especially in the experience that I've had working with women is that if they don't trust or feel valued by their leader, they're out the door.
So organizations were really great at figuring out how to attract the talent, bring the talent, hire the talent, meet their diversity quotas, which is exactly kind of what it was, but they didn't know how to retain them or engage them or get the most out of them.
So I felt that that part of the equation was really missing.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Absolutely.
And we know that there are a lot of employees that are out there that are paying a huge tax that have to cover when they show up in the workplace.
And that is exhausting.
It takes an incredible amount of time and attention to really recreate how you're showing up so that it is seen to be a value to the organization, which means that we're getting less of them and they're not feeling that they belong and therefore not feeling that their contributions are even valued, let alone meaningful.
And so it's a huge aspect for best bosses to really think about.
Right, excellent.

Christine Laperriere:
And then tell us a little bit about what you've experienced in a not great leader.
What have you noticed that really for you, you're like, oh, I hope I never do that.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yeah, I've been really lucky.
I've been very blessed.
I've had some phenomenal leaders.
And the ones that I tended to struggle with more tended to be more, I would say, indirect, not as transparent.
For me, it's just, it feels a bit like you're playing a game of telephone where the message gets twisted every time it's told and you're trying to figure out, read between the lines and kind of guess what they're trying to say.
And to meet up feels really risky and is also a really big waste of time.
And so I tend to gravitate towards leaders who are a little bit fired up, make it upset occasionally, but their passion and their commitment is there and they're able to just say things as it is and then we move forward.

Christine Laperriere:
I like that.
It's easy to follow somebody when you, like you said, when you just feel like you know what you're working with, right?

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Exactly, yep.

Christine Laperriere:
And so here's kind of my last thought-provoking question for you.
If you had to teach or advise future leaders on how to be a best boss, tell me more about how you would, what would you encourage them to focus on and any other tips or tricks that you've really seen in your career that help make leaders great.
Because the audience that listens to this show are people that are really sharpening the saw to be those best bosses.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
So I would, I've kind of narrowed it down to not three, which is the rule, but two, three, and then two extras.
So the first one I would say is what, exactly what we were talking about.
Create a psychologically safe environment for everyone.
Encourage people to say hard things versus just saying or doing things that make you feel good as the leader because a lot of people are telling leaders what they want to hear, which is, in my opinion, a risk gateway and a major barrier to innovation.
So that would be number one.
Number two is to intentionally create a team that is diverse and inclusive with a culture of belongingness and trust in which everybody has a unique contribution of the team and then supporting them to leverage that uniqueness in really powerful ways.
And I think that's the whole idea of a team is that we don't have all the same expertise.
We don't have the same knowledge.
We also have the same things that we love to do that really light us up when we're in the zone.
And so that's a way that a team can really learn to leverage each other.
And third, I would say to really understand and embrace the power of connection.
Creating rapport with your team, getting to know what makes them tick the things they love to do most in their current role, what they'd love to do more of.
Marcus Buckingham posed them red threads in his new book.
Gay Hendrix calls it the zone of genius.
So helping your team members to look for ways to accomplish their goals while spending more time in these flow states in which they'll be happier, they'll be more resilient, they'll be more productive, more innovative and engaged.
First bonus is really the power of a strong network.
This is, people get very focused on networking and I think the way to reframe that is to really think about a powerfully strong network.
It's not about just going at a meeting people.
It's about understanding that good leadership is a team sport and success comes from knowing who, not how.
That one for me has served powerfully.
And then the last one is to lift heavily as you climb.
Always looking for meaningful ways to pay it forward.
And I think this one I've seen more and more from what I would say are less traditional leaders who are breaking the status quo, who are being their own unique selves, who are able to be role models for others to sort of see it and be it.
And one of the things they're doing is lifting heavily as they climb.
And I think that that is the true mark of a great leader and a great boss.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is fantastic.
That's probably one of my favorite, I'm gonna steal that.
That's gonna be one of my new favorite quotes, the lift heavy as you climb.
Because it makes so much sense.
I think as we're talking about so much around leadership so often, the conversation is around that individual.
But the idea of lifting others up to me is a trait of a best boss.
It is, absolutely.
It's a powerful one to keep in mind.
And who are you lifting up?
You should be able to answer that one right off the top of your head if you're really doing it.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Yep, exactly.
And it's a great strategy for your own personal growth and development.
I know so many people who wanted to continue to grow, wanted to get to different levels in the organization and were kind of stuck because they weren't building their sort of proteges of the future.
So the more you bring people up into growth and expansion, the more likely you're going to be able to do the same.

Christine Laperriere:
That is a fantastic way to wrap this up.
I think this was fantastic talking to you.
Thank you so much.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Thank you, Christine.
And I really had a great time.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I'll encourage everyone to look you up, Jennifer Laidlaw on LinkedIn and they can follow you and learn a little bit more about you.
Thank you, Jennifer.

Jennifer Laidlaw:
Thank you, Christine.

MD Management is an amazing firm that I'll be leading.
We work with Canadian physicians and their families, which is such an important job, and I don't take that lightly.
And that is what kind of drives me in this role is the responsibility that we have at MD Management.
I've been with the firm for 16 years.
I started in Edmonton.
I worked in Vancouver and B.C.
I recently moved to Ottawa to take over the firm.
So I'm super excited about it and a little nervous.
But that's OK.
Nerves kind of mean that I still care about what I do.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that means that you're going to perform at your best.
So I'm just going to dive right in.
When I invited you to talk about some of your best bosses, I'd love to hear who came to mind.

Pam Allen:
Well, I had a number of great leaders throughout my career that I kind of took little bits of things from.
But the one story that really stood out for me for someone that I worked with for a number of years, probably 15, 20 years ago, was someone who I actually didn't work for him initially.
I worked in another role and I saw what he was doing.
The team he was building up.
And I thought, you know, he needs a certain role on his team.
So I took a risk and I met him one day and I said to him, you know, I know you're building your team up and I think you need this role.
Here's why you need this role.
And I would love to take on that role.
And initially said, oh, OK, thanks for letting me know.
And I thought, OK, well, that he didn't accept it right away.
And I'm good with that.
But a few months later, he came to me and said, Pam, you're right.
We need this role and I'd love you to take it on.
So what that meant for me was he was willing to take the risk on me.
He saw something in me.
He was curious about what I was going to bring to the role.
And again, it didn't happen right away, but he took a risk.
I took a risk.
And again, it didn't come to fruition immediately.
And that's OK.
And working with him, he allowed me to play big and he allowed me the space to build the role and build my team.
And I was telling somebody this other story a few days ago about how I went to him and said, someone on the team wants to buy pens, they want to buy 100 pens.
And I just want to know if it's OK if we go ahead and buy these pens.
And he became curious and he said to me, OK, if you do this for this person, you're going to have to do this person and this person.
And soon it kind of adds up.
I'm like, OK, I've never thought of it that way.
So just think about when you make these decisions, the ripple effect that it can have and think of all the different angles.
Again, this is just a story about pens.
It doesn't seem like a big deal.
But as it kind of grew, I realized, OK, I need to think about this.
And at the end, he said, you know, it's your decision, but really think it through again.
He allowed me he was curious.
He allowed me to play in the space.
He allowed me to play big.
And I have a story about playing big, but I'll maybe tell that a little bit later.

Christine Laperriere:
So I think this is really neat, though, because there's two sides.
Like, obviously, you felt safe enough to approach him with a completely out of the box idea, even if his decision making wasn't going to allow you right out of the gate to go forward with it, which I kind of also think is a sign of a good leader.
He took time to reflect on that.
It didn't go away just because he didn't answer it in that moment.
So I think there's something special about hearing that story.
And also kudos to you, because I work with a lot of people who feel very impatient.
And so when a leader doesn't just say yes, they're immediately like disappointed.
And so what I hear is kind of this you trusted him enough to give him some time.

Pam Allen:
Yeah.
And I believed that I took a risk.
I thought the worst that could happen is he says, no, we don't need it.
It was OK.
Like, I thought I put it out there.
It'll come back when it's ready to come back.
And I'm OK with that.
But I learned a lot from him.
And he really, again, gave me that space.
He showed a lot of curiosity, which I think is very important in a leader.
He was open to my ideas.
And it just it gave me that confidence to play big, built my team.
So when I talk about playing big, what that means is working with a great leader will give you confidence.
My son's a hockey player.
He was a hockey player.
He's older now.
He doesn't play anymore.
But when he was playing hockey, he was a goalie.
And we had a sports psychologist come and talk to his team.
And he was fascinating.
And he talked specifically about when you're a goaltender or a hockey player, when you have that confidence, you play big, you take up space.
So you're more engaged in the game.
You see the game clearer.
And when you play big, you take risks.
And again, it's that confidence and taking up the space and allows you for engagement and seeing things clearer.
I was so intrigued by this sports psychologist.
I said to him, will you talk to my leaders?
Because a lot of what you're saying translates so well into leadership.
And he did.
And it was just fascinating how it translated back and forth between.
I mean, that's not new sports psychology and leadership.
But I truly have kind of taken everything I've learned from him as a psychologist into my leadership to allow others around me to, again, take risks, play big, be confident, be engaged and see things clearer.

Christine Laperriere:
And I'm just curious, I'm going to probe into something you said, talking about taking up space.
You feel I mean, obviously, you're stepping into a CEO role.
I support lots of female leaders, and I'm just curious, like, do you feel like taking up space was instinctive to you?
Or did you need to learn how to do that?

Pam Allen:
Oh, I need to learn how to do that.
Absolutely.
In so many ways.
If you go back to me as a child, I was very shy growing up.
I was very quiet.
I didn't talk a lot and just even little things to help me get into that mindset of playing big, taking up space.
Even I was at a lunch the other day and it was a long table.
It was like a boardroom table.
And, you know, sometimes you just go and sit at the corner of the table, you kind of sit back.
I thought, no, I'm going to sit in the middle of the table and take up some space.
So it's not only mentally, it's physically.
It's like when you're a leader, you need to command that.
And don't be don't shrink.
Take up physical space as well as mental space.
So taking up space is also about giving your team that opportunity to kind of think.
I really believe leaders need to be curious.
Asking questions is one of the most important things you can do.
And sometimes it's not even asking questions.
It's just allowing them to talk it through.
So what comes to mind for me is I had a leader that worked for me.
And when he was going through something, he would come into my office and he'd say, Pam, I know you don't like me to bring you problems, only solutions, but here's something I'm dealing with.
And I just sat there and let him talk it through.
I'd ask a question every once in a while, but I just sat there.
And at the end of it, he's like, yeah, I know what I'm going to do.
And then he walked away.
And someone said to me when I told him the story, I said, they probably thought, wow, Pam really helped me through it.
When, in fact, I didn't say a lot.
I allowed him to kind of talk it through and work it through on his own.
And I felt like he owned the decision.
I'm not the subject matter expert.
He owned the decision.
He implemented it.
And that just gave him that learning.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Pam Allen:
And, you know, we don't use soft, fuzzy words about like caring and loving.
But what I always think is curiosity is the socially acceptable word that we can use, because when somebody gives you space and actually you put your full attention on them, that's what it feels like.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Pam Allen:
I feel like someone cares and really cares about you.
You know, that you matter.
I always want people that work for me to feel that they matter, that they're contributing, because when you feel that again, it's, you know, they bring their whole person to work.
So they feel better as an individual.
It's not just the job they do.
They are a person.
So if you treat your people like a whole person, they have everyone has something going on in their life, good and bad.
And just remember that at all times.

Christine Laperriere:
And then I'm just curious.
You know, I'm going to go back to that great boss that you worked for who was curious and helped you play big and instilled that confidence in you.
How does working for someone like that impact your performance?

Pam Allen:
It helps you be a top performer.
And again, it's giving you that you may take some risks.
That's OK.
When you have confidence and you feel good about what you're doing, you kind of lift up.
And again, it's that taking up space, playing big.
I knew he would always have my back as well.
I knew that I could come to him when I needed to.
I could make the decisions.
And if I made a bad decision, we would talk about it and I would learn from it.
It wasn't about being reprimanded.
It was about learning.
So going through why I did it, what was the outcome?
What did I learn from it?
How will I apply that next time?
At the end of the day, we're in financial services.
Bad decision can easily be rectified.
So it's a matter of learning and support and knowing that I'm not going to feel like, oh, he wouldn't come bring me down for something like that.
He would help lift me up and learn from that.

Christine Laperriere:
And then the question that comes up, I mean, this is in my world, is when you work for a best boss or let's say you have an organization filled with best bosses, everyone always asks, what's the ROI or what's the impact of the bottom line?
And I know that's a hard question to answer.
When I ask you that as a leader and you're looking at the financials of your business, what comes to mind?

Pam Allen:
It is about people like looking, having a clear vision of the organization and caring about the art.
When you care about the organization, we talk often at MD about being purpose driven and bringing value to the client.
The bottom line is can be short term as leaders.
We need to look further out and look longer term.
And when you have great leaders, that's what they will do.
They will be constantly looking up, looking at the longer term, ensuring that we have a long standing viable organization and not short sighted.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
When you're looking anything you do, when you look right in front of you, driving.

Pam Allen:
So I just learned to drive a motorcycle.
And when I took the course, it was like they kept saying, look up, look up.
So it's always about looking up and looking out.
And great leaders do that.
And that's, you know, what comes down to the ROI.
It's not, again, that short term.
One of the leaders at MD management would always say as a leader, it's like a sailboat.
You're looking out onto the horizon.
And you're looking longer term to get to the destination you want to get to.
So great leaders are always, again, looking up, looking out.
And that will get you to where you want to be.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's what's so interesting is that impact to the bottom line.
It's like, how do you bring everybody with you for that journey?
Do people feel engaged in being on that journey with you?
I mean, we've seen the great resignation.
Big talk about how much turnover is happening right now.
I find that when I hear about those best bosses, if people are leaving, they're not leaving.
They're not leaving their boss.
They're leaving for some real growth opportunity.
They're not leaving for just more money.
What I'm also seeing is people come back to the table and negotiate for what they want versus leaving those great leaders because they don't want to walk away.

Pam Allen:
My first story, I asked for what I wanted.
And I believe in that as well as I want it to be with the organization.
And here's where I saw where I could grow and develop.
And I've done that a number of times over my career is.
And I when someone comes to me and says, here's what I want.
I really admire and respect that and say, OK, this is what you want.
Let's talk about how we can get you there.
It may not be tomorrow, but let's talk about the journey that we need to to get you on, to get you to where you want to be.
And as leaders, we have a responsibility to bring others up.
It's not about, you know, when I got into leadership, I knew it wasn't just about me anymore and getting to my it was about bringing up others along the way.
And especially as a female leader, I had a client at MD say to me one time, does your advisor force reflect your client base?
Because that's what we want.
We want you to reflect your clients.
So, again, it's about bringing everybody up, not just people who are like you.
So as a female, I want to bring up other female leaders.
I also want to bring up other leaders of different, you know, mindsets, different ethnicities.
I want to bring everybody up.
So we have that diversity of thought, of appearance, of, you know, every representing every aspect of the human life.
So that that helps with diversity, with bringing new ideas to the table, understanding our clients.
It's just, again, the ROI on that just is amazing on what we can do.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's got to be, again, it's great when you're serving an audience of people who are from all over the world.

Pam Allen:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
You need to think, how do you get in the customer's shoes if you don't understand those different.

Pam Allen:
Right.
Yeah, exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm curious, have you had a worst boss?
What did you learn or observe maybe from some of the experiences you've had from a not great leader?

Pam Allen:
Haven't had many.
I've only I've had more great bosses than not great bosses.
But one that comes to mind was, again, early in my career, very early in my career, was someone who kind of tried to hold on to the information and the power.
And, you know, when you think of the theory of abundance and the theory of scarcity, he operated from theory of scarcity where he felt there wasn't a lot of power.
So I need to hold on to it.
And I learned a lot that there's enough to go around for everybody.
The theory of abundance is there's enough power influence to go around.
That was a big learning for me.
There was two of them that came to mind.
And they both had that trait was that theory of scarcity and didn't believe around multiplying the people around them.
There's a book called The Multiplier.
And we've talked about it in leadership meetings at MD, at Scotia as well, about multiplying people around you and not diminishing them.
And that was my biggest learning is I also have a story about Donald Trump, which I share often.

Christine Laperriere:
It's I'm all ears.

Pam Allen:
So about 15 years ago, I went to a conference and they had speakers from around the world on this big screen.
He wasn't there in person.
Donald Trump was one of them long before he got into politics.
And so you think, OK, you know, he had a bit better of a reputation at that time.
So he talked about surrounding yourselves with a players, you know, as a leader.
That's the one thing you should do.
And I thought, yes, that's what I want to surround myself with a players.
I want to surround myself with people and leaders that one day I would love to work for.
That was the only thing I've ever learned from Donald Trump.
I don't know if he still subscribes to that theory.

Christine Laperriere:
I question that.
But at one time he did.
And I did learn something from him at that time.
We'll let everyone go and look at the players he surrounded.

Pam Allen:
Yes, exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Does he still still subscribe?

Pam Allen:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
Leadership principle.
But it's a true one, right?
That idea of surrounding yourself with a players.
And I really liked that point you made about scarcity versus abundance.

Pam Allen:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
An aha moment just kind of flashed when I think of 50 different interviews about his best bosses.
It really does seem that that could be a core principle of those best bosses because there was no fear.
There was just no fear.
There was no fear in the interaction they were having with that employee that they were trying to build up or they were trying to strengthen.
It was really coming from a place of genuine desire to help.

Pam Allen:
That is a great point that brings to mind.
I love Brene Brown.
I have a couple of her books on my bookshelf.
I actually shared Dare to Lead with my team a few years back.
And we did kind of like a book club and re-read it.
One of the things that I love that she talks about that I take with me everywhere is honesty is kindness.
So when you're honest with your team and that goes around feedback, you don't want to wait, you know, for months to give someone feedback, immediate feedback, leaning into those difficult conversations, difficult conversations are easy to just say, oh, I don't want to do this.
And, you know, I've had those conversations with my team members and it can help build your relationships with your leaders.
And it helps them grow.
And I remember getting feedback one time from one of my bosses.
And she talked about something that happened months earlier.
And she's giving me this feedback.
And I'm still in my, she's giving me the feedback.
I'm in my head going, what happened?
When was that?
What?
And I'm trying to dig into what was I going through at that point that she's giving me this feedback?
So that was a great learning for me in that, OK, give feedback immediately, lean into those difficult conversations.
Sometimes you have to wait, you know, a day or two, which is fine.
Or, you know, I gave someone feedback last week and I waited till after the call we were on, called the person up after and said, you know, here's how I saw you showing up.
Let's talk about that.
And at the end of the conversation, he was like, you know, I really appreciate the feedback.
You know, here's what I'm going to do different next time.
So, again, it's being honest and leaning into those tough conversations, builds your relationships and helps grow those people.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's the best thing you can do.
Well, it's funny that you mentioned that, because another principle that I kind of picked up over all of the series of interviews is that candid, honest feedback.
You have to believe that the leader wants the best for you.

Pam Allen:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
That's the prerequisite to making candid feedback work.

Pam Allen:
Well, you're doing it because you care, right?
If I didn't care about the person, I wouldn't give them the feedback.
I would let them kind of go along their way.
But saying, you know, this is how you showed up.
Good or bad is just the kindest thing you can do for an individual.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
And that comes up over and over in those best bosses that they really do feel that kindness from that difficult piece of feedback that they got as we're getting ready, obviously, to work with a large group of leaders from your organization.
And I always say, you know, for all the leaders that are listening right now, trying to figure out how to up their game.
What advice would you give people, you know, if they want to aspire to be a best boss?

Pam Allen:
I always say, be yourself.
You do you better than anyone does you.
Like you learn things from all your bosses as you go forward and you develop your leadership style.
But that's the advice I've given to a lot of leaders along my journey is be yourself.
Don't try and be me.
Don't try and be Barack Obama.
Don't try and be someone else, because that's where the genuineness of leadership comes in is when you're you're true to yourself.
And again, setting expectations with your individuals to say, here's how we how do you like to work with me?
What do you like to see?
Like getting feedback, being curious, asking those questions of your teams.
You're not the subject matter expert.
And the way they do something may not be the way you do something.
So a story around that is I had one of my leaders come to me recently and he said, I want to move this person into this role.
And my first reaction was like, no, oh, that's going to be a huge mistake.
You know, and I'm thinking that in my mind, I didn't say it.
I'm like, OK, tell me about, you know, what you've gone through.
We've had some issues with this person in the past.
And he went through, you know, here's the feedback we've given him.
Here's what we're going to do like to develop him going forward.
Here's why I want to put him into this role.
And I thought, wow, like he's really done his work.
He's thought this through and he truly believes in this decision.
So I said, OK, you know, not what I would have done, but I think you're making a great decision and I support you on this decision.
So I think he was a little taken aback.
He's like, OK.
And I said, no, you've done everything that I think you needed to do.
In the end, it is your decision, but I will support you on this decision.
So, again, it's asking those questions, being curious about who they are.
Someone gave me some advice is when you're kind of working a room at a social function is always ask more questions than you answer.
And people will think you're the most interesting person in the room if you ask more questions.
So as a leader, do that as well.
Ask lots of questions.
Be curious.
It's the best advice I think I could give.

Christine Laperriere:
I absolutely agree.
And I think, you know, it's amazing when you follow around great leaders or you spend time with them, you'll notice that curiosity there immediately.
I can think of so many different times where I've met people who are not curious versus very curious.
And it is it's a completely different experience.
But I'm curious, do you ever struggle with imposter syndrome?

Pam Allen:
Yes, quite often.
So my son has graduated from university and he got a job with the government.
And I asked him, you know, how's it going?
You know, he was very nervous about going into the job.
And he said, I'm learning a lot.
There's a lot to learn.
And he brought up imposter syndrome.
He goes, I feel like I have imposter syndrome.
So he asked me, he goes, I don't know if you feel like that.
But I certainly feel like that every day.
Like I have.
But you.
But I kind of OK, I feel it.
I check it.
And I know that, no, Pam, you're here for a reason.
You you've got the experience.
So some of that self-talk, but the fact that he's in use, you like he said, Mom, you're going to be the CEO of a company.
You have imposter syndrome.
Absolutely.
But I again, I check it.
I, OK, talk to myself about why are you feeling this way?
What do you know is true?
And what are you making up?
Like, what are the facts?
So I've had leaders come to me with stories that they're telling us.
OK, what do you know for sure?
What are the facts?
So that's what I go through when I feel like I have imposter syndrome.
But oh, absolutely.
And I think it's OK because I market and I check it.
I know it.
I label it and I work through it.
So I think everybody does.
I would be shocked if great leaders didn't at some point in their career have some sort of imposter syndrome.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
And, you know, I have a coach that's coached me for years and he is brilliant.
And his recommendation is not so much to try to combat imposter syndrome.
It's to get good at it.

Pam Allen:
Oh, I like that.
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And I feel like just like you said, it's like finding your process to work through it right so that you can move through it quickly.

Pam Allen:
Don't let it paralyze you.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Like, could it be your intuition trying to tell you to stop and think?
Right.

Pam Allen:
Oh, yeah.
Listen to your gut is a great piece of advice.
I've listened to my gut over the years.
There's something there in your intuition.
And to your point, have that process to work through.
After I graduated university, I started at a credit union, actually, and I was trying to work my way up through different roles, different sales roles.
And I didn't get a role.
And I thought, oh, I wonder why I didn't get it.
So I went to the people hiring.
It was HR.
And I said, can you tell me why I didn't get the role?
And this is so sad.
But I was actually told, well, we gave it to this gentleman because he has a family to support and we thought it was more important to give him the role.
And I was, wow, OK.
So they used to have these breakfasts with the CEO.
And they would bring a small group of employees to ask the CEO questions.
So I'm like, hey, I'm going to do it.
So I asked him because there they didn't have a lot of female leaders.
Very few, in fact.
And I asked him, I said, why don't women get promoted in this organization?
I didn't share my story, but I just said, you know, from what I see, we're not seeing a lot of women being promoted.
And it kind of took him aback.
And he said, I'm not really sure, you know, what it is that keeps women back.
And he said, you know, I'll have to look into that and reflect on it.
They would actually take notes during these meetings and publish them.
So people came up to me and I can't believe you asked him that.
And I'm like, well, it's true.
And they actually ended up developed a new role and they brought on a woman and the CEO actually came back to me and said, you know, you said this at the breakfast meeting and we started to reflect on it.
So we brought this woman in.
But it's I feel it's really changed over the years that I've been in, especially financial services is seeing more women, the value of women and just overall diversity, not just women now, it's all kinds of cultures, ethnicities, LGBTQ plus bringing all of that together to bring different perspectives to the table will really bring value to an organization.
But again, when I started, it was predominantly not seeing women promoted.
Now we're seeing evolution, which is amazing to see.
And I continue to support it and see how we can bring more diversity into every organization.

Christine Laperriere:
It's making me smile because it that story aligns with that.
Ask for what you want the theme that's popping up.
Why are there not more women promoted?
Any additional stories or fun things that you want to share as you think about this topic around leadership and some of the ways that it shows up?

Pam Allen:
You know, leadership is everywhere.
No matter what level you're at, how big, small your team is.
Leadership is everywhere.
Everyone can be a leader.
You can be a leader with colleagues, peers, lead your team, be a leader everywhere you can be.
I believe in managing up.
And sometimes that doesn't have the greatest connotation, but sometimes you can lead your leaders and help them be better leaders.
And I appreciate that from my team as well.
You know, I had a situation with one of my leaders who I sat down with them and said, here's what I see is going on.
Here's what we need from you.
Here's where you can be a better leader.
And he was so appreciative of the feedback that I felt it was almost my responsibility to kind of give him that feedback as well to help him be a better leader.
So, again, leadership is not just down, it's up, around, you know, to the left, to the right, wherever it is.
Always be a leader wherever you are in life.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Well, listen, thank you so much for the time today.

Pam Allen:
Thank you for this.
I love talking about this.
This is a great topic.
And if it helps support other people in their journey, that's the best thing we can do.
And giving back is is is something that I'm very passionate about as well.

Title: Taking the competition for talent seriously
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jonathan Needham

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I invited Jonathan Needham to come on the show.
Jonathan, I invited you because I worked with you at Vanguard Investments.
I had a wonderful time working with you and I also really appreciated the way that you led your team in that environment.
You were approachable and down to earth and you created a very collaborative environment and you were just incredibly likable.
It was neat to see what that did for the rest of the team because so many people rallied and it was a great environment where people had a lot of fun.
I had to ask you to tell me a little bit more about your best boss and how they inspired you.
Thanks so much for coming on the show.

Jonathan Needham:
Well, thanks, Christine.
Great to be here.
I appreciate you having me and you got me blushing a little bit this afternoon.

Christine Laperriere:
There you go.
With that, can you just give everybody a little bit about your background and who you are so people can find you?

Jonathan Needham:
Yeah, sure.
Certainly.
I've been in the financial services industry for call it 25 years now.
I started in this business in human resources so I was a recruiter for one of the largest asset managers globally and then kind of worked my way up through the ranks of the financial services industry.
Most recently, I'm a vice president and director and lead of the ETF distribution channel for TD Asset Management.
I've been here for two years.
It's a great firm, great team and we're growing very quickly, which is very nice.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Tell us who's your best boss ever and give us a little bit about who that person is and what they're like.

Jonathan Needham:
Yeah.
Thanks, Christine.
I've been pretty fortunate.
I've had many great leaders throughout my career, many great mentors too that weren't my boss per se, but who really influenced me in my career.
I'd like to say who I am today as a leader.
My best boss ever was so good, I'm now working for him again for a second time.
Someone you've worked with, someone you know quite well, Christine, and that's Jason McIntyre.

Christine Laperriere:
I think this is amazing that I did see that you followed Jason from Vanguard now to TD, which is pretty interesting.
That tells me a lot about he must be a best boss.
Not many of us go for a second round unless they're not a great boss.
Tell us, what is it like to work with Jason?
Why would you say he's a best boss?

Jonathan Needham:
There's no single one thing really.
There's multiple reasons.
I think first, he's authentic.
He's got a lot of integrity.
He's got empathy.
Those are kind of a few things.
The other thing I would say what I like about him is he's really got a relentless passion for the business.
He's just constantly engaged in the industry, what's going on, who's who, and how do we grow.
I'll say inspiring from that perspective.
I think the other thing that I really like about Jason is he's really good at empowering his people.
He has a very real and genuine interest in them as people, as performers of course, but also as people.
I'd also say he's someone who's very competitive.
You know him.
You've worked with him.
He's got very much of a sports coach style to his leadership, which for me worked.
One of the things I like about that is it's a constant kind of challenge to push you past your limits.
Certainly very supportive along the way, but it's that kind of coaching style that I think is what really drives me to working with them a second time.

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny because I always noticed with Jason when he saw somebody that was talented, he would just march right up and engage and get to know them.
I kind of thought that was an interesting quality where it wasn't like he just said, oh, nice job.
He was like, nice job and I want to get to know you better because I'm going to leverage you.
I'm going to figure out how we're going to work together.
He knows how to spot talent and kind of go after it.
I think that's probably an amazing quality because I noticed that the teams that he would build were just chuck full of really good people.

Jonathan Needham:
I 100% agree.
I mean, he does that today really well too within the organization.
You can tell when he says, keep an eye on her or keep an eye on him, you know they're going places.
He's always there to kind of help and be a sounding board and push them to do that because he identifies it pretty quickly.
Also, the team that he's created that I'm a part of, they're all veterans and they would be, I'd say, very sought after from other organizations.
The fact that he was able to get them I think is an accolade to his ability to identify talent and his ability to kind of have those folks want to work with him and for him.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me, what is it like?
Give me some examples.
What's it like in a meeting with him?
I know he's had tough coaching with you, so tell me when he's had a tough coaching conversation, tell me about that.

Jonathan Needham:
Yeah, sure.
I mean, I'll start with the positive.
I think when you work with someone like that, it feels less like work and more like a game.
A game that you want to win, not just for yourself, but because you don't I think, as you know, and as you've seen, he's very candid, right?
And he's going to challenge you when he sees something that he doesn't think is really kind of showing your best self to others.
And so I'll tell you a story that's kind of a funny story is we get an opportunity to go to these industry events often and represent our company and our brand.
I've had our best report at these conferences with thousands, 10,000s of people.
I've been very fortunate that he sent me to many of those over the years.
And there just happened to be one that took place in sunny Florida.
And I would like to say, for the most part, I did a really good job of representing the group.
But there was a little spot at lunchtime, there was a speaker that I'd already seen.
And so I thought it was a good opportunity for me to go for a little swim in the ocean.
So I put, you know, put on my bathing suit, I didn't think twice, I walked through the lobby, and I went out, went for a swim, came back and went to the went to the rest of the session.
Of course, I just happened to pass by a lot of senior executives from Philadelphia at the time, which quickly got back to Jason that, Hey, did you know your guy was swimming mid day?
And so let's just say that was a much tougher conversation when I got back.
He's like, Really?
What were you thinking?
You know, could you not have gone the other way, or at least not done it at all.
And so I think, you know, the challenge is a positive challenge that he's not afraid to kind of call you out.
And I still get teased about that, despite the fact that that was almost seven years ago today.
He still challenges me publicly teases me about that that time.

Christine Laperriere:
So every time he sends you to an industry event, he asks if everybody's gonna see you in your bathing suit.

Jonathan Needham:
Absolutely.
Did I pack my speedo?
I know, should I be allowed to go?
All those kind of things.
He has fun at my expense.
Deservedly so.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
But that I mean, that goes back to like the feeling of friendship and connection and the ability to kind of keep it fun, you know, but I love the fact that he brought up that candid issue, because again, those are the things that a lot of people won't say anything, but then they start to hold a resentment.
And over time, all of a sudden, you're in trouble with somebody and you don't know why.

Jonathan Needham:
Absolutely that that, you know, he's always done a really good job of trying to protect me from myself.
And so you know, whether or not it bothered him or not, he knows that, you know, the optics of that may not be ideal.
And so making sure that I identified that is key.

Christine Laperriere:
You want to make sure yeah, you weren't in or standing with anybody that was important, right?

Jonathan Needham:
You got it.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.
No, that's great.
Tell me also kind of what kind of things you notice when you're in discussions, meetings, you're trying to solve problems, things like that.
Tell me what is it like?

Jonathan Needham:
Yeah, you know what, I think one of the things I've always said is, and one of the reasons I followed him is it's, you know, it's uplifting to have a role model like someone you respect, you admire someone you strive to be like.
And I think that's a perfect example.
You know, when you ask about what's a meeting look like, I mean, first of all, if you're not five minutes early, you're late.
If you don't have an agenda, there was no point in the meeting.
If you don't have an actionable takeaway from that that meeting that was obviously discussed and collaborated and challenged along the way, then it wasn't an effective meeting, and he's going to let you know that.
And so I think, you know, that's what I see in meetings and all meetings is like, I can learn by example, because I know when he runs a meeting, he's going to be early, he's going to be coordinated, he's going to have input ahead of time, any pre-work would have been done.
And so he expects that of others.
And I think, you know, I learned a lot from that is it's someone you want to emulate.
It's a style that I think works.
And I think it's important, particularly, you know, over the last couple of years to make sure that you're, you know, you're meaningful and you're concise, and there's actual ideas when you're going into a meeting, just don't meet for the sake of meeting.
And I think, to me, that's what I've noticed when he runs a meeting, when he's a part of a meeting, it's always actionable.
What are we doing?
Why are we here?
And then kind of how does that trickle down to the rest of the organization?
It trickles down because people are action oriented, right?
I think what happens when you're running an effective meeting that is, you know, obviously outcome based, if you will, that makes sure everybody else is on their toes.
So they're everybody steps up their game to make sure that they're prepared to make sure that they're speaking their voice because it's, you know, be heard now, or you might not get heard, because obviously we want to go away with some takeaways on what we're going to do in our next steps.
And so I think it really drives results, to be quite frank, is it drives efficiencies, it drives results, it drives actions.

Christine Laperriere:
And then that kind of leads to one of my second questions that I love asking is, you know, in my world, I work with about 100 leaders and you know, companies are always asking me what the return on investment is in investing in leaders becoming great bosses, right?
So if you had to articulate what you think the actual impact of the organization is when they have a best boss in a senior executive role, like what's the benefit of that?

Jonathan Needham:
I mean, Christine, there's a very high positive correlation with the strong leadership and results.
I think it starts from recruiting.
You know, people want to work for people with good reputations.
I mean, a current example is the team that he's built here at TDS or management.
You know, these are veterans that probably had the choice of multiple places and they decided to come to TD, mainly for him first, for the firm second.
So I think that helps.
You can see that on the recruiting side to attract high performing talent.
The second is retention.
He really is.
And I think any great leader is really a developer of people and they take more pride in the success of others than they even do in the success of their own.
So, you know, that's kind of like that winning mindset is if others win, you know, we're going to win.
And so from my experience with him and other great leaders, he's always hit and exceeded targets from doing it from an established organization to a startup to turnarounds.
I think it's that winning mentality.
It's that empowering of others.
Like I said, two different places, very lofty goals and obviously hitting in or exceeding those targets.
So it's nothing but a positive impact on the bottom line, the metrics and results.
And, you know, leadership also with great leadership comes less disruption because you've got a higher retention.
You've got a better pipeline of recruits and you've essentially got people that are more comfortable with working with each other because they know they can obviously succeed in that environment.

Christine Laperriere:
I agree completely, but it's fun to hear that come from your perspective and what you're seeing, because I feel like that's what I witnessed.
So then when you think of bosses that you've worked for who were not the best bosses, they don't have to be the worst, but not the best.
Like, tell me a little bit about what that looked like for you.

Jonathan Needham:
Yeah, I got a couple of examples.
So I'll start with the simple one.
I'll do first names only because it's a small street, a small industry.
We'll just say his name, his but long story short, I worked for a company once and very briefly, and you'll probably understand why shortly.
And I think it was the second week on the job and it was the morning kickoff meeting.
This boss particularly said, oh, it's time for Offside Friday.
I was like, Offside Friday.
What British background?
Let's just say he spent the next 20 minutes telling a bunch of extremely offside jokes.
I could see the discomfort around the room, especially among the younger folks, especially among the younger female folks in particular.
And it was just like, are you kidding me?
Never mind in any timeframe.
But in this day and age, this was about 10 years ago, just not appropriate.
That same boss called me the following Friday where we were doing a sales meeting at 11 a.m.
and he was called in remotely.
He wasn't there physically.
So he kicked off the call.
He ran the call.
He's very eloquent.
I'm in the call.
But right after the call, he called me.
He said, okay, get the troops together.
Come to the bar.
I'm like, come to the bar.
It's 11 a.m.
He says, yeah, I've been at the bar all night.
I haven't been home.
And I've got motivational speech I want to give the folks.
I said, that's a horrible idea.
I can still tell that you've got, you know, you're some beverages.
Let's just say you're under the influence.
You know what?
You work for me.
Bring the team.
Okay.
Against my advice, I took the team there and it did not go well.
I mean, he did not set a good example for what a leader should look like, right?
He disheveled, you know, red face, so on and so forth.
And so worst boss ever.
I only stayed in that job for six weeks.
Definitely not a fit.
Six weeks.

Christine Laperriere:
Six weeks.

Jonathan Needham:
Six weeks.
It's not even on the resume.
Six weeks.
I had to get out of there.

Christine Laperriere:
That's pretty quick.
And offside Friday is a big red flag right out of the gate.
You know, big red flag and probably just like the rules around driving vehicles should be the same rules around leading people.
You know, it's like under the influence, like, you know, stay at home, get somebody else to drive.
You don't you don't need to lead a team at that moment in time.

Jonathan Needham:
Exactly.
Yeah.
The other other thing I would say is, you know, and I worked, like I said, been pretty fortunate.
Most of my bosses have been really good.
But but the ones that I find don't fit my style are the ones that aren't really willing to to empower their people.
They're a little controlling.
They're a little bit more, you know, asking you for every little detail following up on every little detail thing, almost like they don't trust you just can't give up the job.
And so I've seen it multiple times when you get somebody who's been a really good individual contributor, and they go to a leader capacity, they still have a hard time taking off that individual contributor hat, and they want to control everything.
And so I think that's where you need to determine, you know, should you really be putting that strong individual contributor into leadership?
And or if you're going to do so, make sure you're bringing in coaches that can help them in that transition.
Folks like yourself, Christine, ideally you in particular to help that.
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, you know, it's interesting when you say that, because I think of the controlling aspect and go, what's interesting about that, when I think about it, is that it actually speaks to the layer even above that.
So if you have a great individual contributor, let's say someone like yourself, promote you into leadership, what you really need is a boss who enables you now to go build a really solid team.
Because if you can't put great people under you, that controlling instinct is going to pop back up, right?

Jonathan Needham:
100 percent.

Christine Laperriere:
So it just speaks to culture and why it's it's not just one dimension.

Jonathan Needham:
Agreed.

Christine Laperriere:
Those are good examples.
Like I said, I'm still going to be kind of giggling about Offside Friday, though, kind of.

Jonathan Needham:
I still do to this day, too.

Christine Laperriere:
What kind of what kind of jokes would I be telling if I was an Offside Friday?

Jonathan Needham:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We'll talk about that over a glass of Chardonnay another time.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's exactly right.
So if you had to teach or advise future leaders, so a lot of people that listen to the show are trying to kind of build that edge.
They want to be a best leader across.
If you had to give them advice or insight on some of the things that they could do, what would you tell them to focus on?

Jonathan Needham:
I mean, I think lead by example is so important.
So first know that people are watching and looking up to you and are going to catch on whether you're Offsite Fridays and or whether you're running effective, efficient meetings and empowering your people.
So I think that that's first and foremost.
I think the other thing today, you know, people are looking for leaders that are really focused on, you know, what's good, what's right and just for everyone.
So someone who's like decisions and actions are good for society as a whole.
So not just for themselves, but also for their companies, also for the greater society.
And so whose actions are guided by values and morals.
I think that's becoming, you know, more and more important as we grow as a society and as we focus more on doing what's right, right?
You're seeing that on the investment side of the business.
It's like, I want to put my values alongside my dollars.
And so I think that's really important.
One of the questions this came through, you know, you were there when I was doing my MBA course.
And one of the questions that came out to me that I thought was really important is that every leader should really ask ourselves, when I'm thinking about a great leader, would I, would I want this person to be my child's first boss?
So I think I have two daughters, as you know, right?
One's 15 and one's 12.
And so I think about what I want this person to be their boss.
Are they going to help provide that role model and that inspiration and the challenges that I think they need to, to grow and be successful.
And so I think as a leader, if we all ask that question, would, you know, my best friend or with this colleague be thrilled that this person is working for me, I think that would make sure we've got our moral compass in line and we're there to help develop and encourage that development.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
I love, love, love that.
That is really powerful.
And it's very insightful to me.
I think about that sometimes when I look at politics and leadership too, just because I heard someone who was running for office a couple of years ago in the United States and her point of view was to build a country that is the best place in the world to raise a kid.
It was like, you know, somebody asked her, what would you do if you could wave wand?
And that was her answer.
And I feel like it was overlooked at the time because she wasn't one of the front runners, but it was such a powerful answer.
It's like, what if you built a country that was the best place in the world for a kid to grow up?
And I remember thinking, well, that's really powerful.
And I think the question that you just asked, you know, would I want this person to be my kids first boss again, as a mom of two kids and, you know, thinking about what their future is going to look like.
I know instinctively that makes me even more passionate that we need more best bosses.

Jonathan Needham:
I agree.
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm a big fan of Jason's as well, because I like the fact that he does hold people accountable.
He's not winning the likeability award for the sake of just being liked.
He's really trying to win a game, like you said, or he's trying to win, reach those numbers, reach those goals.
He wants to make things happen.
So it's really not about just trying to be a nice person necessarily, but it's also like really having a lot of admiration and respect for the individual you're working with while you're trying to get everybody to rally together to accomplish something big.
I always liked that.
Like you had candor, you know, being able to call you out when you're at the beach.
But that's for real, you know, like I, and I think of that, you know, would I want that person to be my kid's first boss?
And I'm like, yeah, you know what, you know, like I want someone that's able to help them be their best self and, you know, understand the dynamics of business and there, there's multiple dimensions, but also be respectful to them and kind and not make them come home at night and feel deflated.

Jonathan Needham:
Absolutely.
I think there's not enough put on that kind of that kindness, right?
And that's, you know, unfortunate.
I've seen that at the bank in particular, where I think when I was interviewed, you know, Jason's boss, Bruce Cooper, and was like, wow, like, is he really that nice or you guys really want me that badly?
And he's like, no, that's just him.
That's his personality.
He just, he's just one of those individuals.
And so that's the type of culture you want to work for, where you want to hang your hat and hopefully retire at it.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
It's great when you can get that combination, you know, of kindness and really, you know, great integrity and making big things happen.
Well, thank you.
Any last words of wisdom?

Jonathan Needham:
What do I, what I got on?
I think, you know, it's, it's funny when I think about leadership and then, you know, I'll put my NBA hat on for a minute and give you a textbook answer.
If you will, I think, you know, great leaders today, certainly, you know, they foster teamwork.
They value the diversity.
They embrace change.
They encourage that work life balance.
They take responsibility.
They're personal.
They're resourceful.
They're positive.
They really have that competitive spirit.
I think they also today think have to think globally.
They have to continue to be coaches and build successors.
They have to continue to focus on their growth, both personally and professionally.
What I've seen work time and time again in leadership is, is really empowerment, empowerment with guidance.
If you empower your folks and give them the right tools to succeed, you're, you're going to be a successful leader and you're going to have a successful business.
And I think that, that is key as I work with more and more millennials.
As an example, they're just so quick to learn.
It's so quick to go find their, the answers themselves.
And so if you can kind of give some direction, you know, high-level direction and then empower them, you're going to end up with the, with some exceptionally strong results.
And they're also going to feel they've had a very large part to play in those results because they have.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.
And hey, I have one parting words of wisdom for you.
You know, tell Jason next time you see him that I stole one of his leadership pieces of wisdom.
I still use it in all my classes.
You'll hear, hear people say this.
Don't quit your job while you're still in it.

Jonathan Needham:
I love it.
I love it.

Christine Laperriere:
I'll tell them that was one of his quotes and I stole it fair and square.
He didn't have a trademarked, but I always thought you're talking about empowerment with guidance being, you know, a parting words of wisdom.
And I was just like, oh, you know what?
We got to add.
Don't quit your job while you're still in it.

Jonathan Needham:
Absolutely.
It's much easier to get a job while you have one.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
Exactly.
I mean, and he also meant that in like the mental capacity, like don't check out and leave and ruin all that great work that you've done.
And I was like, yeah, I've done that before.
Why do we do that?
You know, you you've got this great report, this great brand.
And just because you're kind of ready for your next thing, you start to to leave the scene before you before you're ready.
Right.

Jonathan Needham:
Sounds like contractors, right, when they renovate the board of the project and they move on when they're 95 percent there.
Meanwhile, they just saw it to the end.
Things would work out better for them on referrals and stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
They'd have a happy customer.

Jonathan Needham:
Exactly.
So good, good words of wisdom, I might.
I won't steal it, but I'll remember it.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, no, steal it.
He didn't have a trademarked, so it's officially it's ours to share now.

Jonathan Needham:
Fantastic, fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
All right.
Well, thank you, Jonathan.
That was fantastic.

Jonathan Needham:
My pleasure, Christine.

Title: Leaving positive cookies
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Christine Andrew

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have invited Christine Andrew onto the show, who I had the luxury of working with at KPMG.
And one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you, Christine, is that first of all, we had a great working relationship.
I really enjoyed working with you.
And it was a really neat environment at the time because I just remember, you know, it was very collaborative.
A lot of incredibly smart people in a room, but really working together to solve problems.
And that culture was pretty special.
So I thought it would make for a great conversation to find out more about your best boss.
Please introduce yourself to everybody.

Christine Andrew:
Thanks so much for inviting me, Christine.
I'm super excited to be here today.
So as mentioned, my name is Christine Andrew.
I'm the Managing Director of Strategy and Digital at one of the big fours.

Christine Laperriere:
Tell us who is your best boss ever, or tell us a little bit about that person and why you thought of them.

Christine Andrew:
So I was reflecting about this on the weekend.
I've been fortunate.
I've worked with so many amazing people in my career today and hope to continue to be able to work with many more in the future.
But one person sticks out for me, and it's because he is so people focused.
Actually, to kind of pull on the thread of collaboration that you just mentioned, he does a lot to foster collaboration.
But even more than that, he focuses on the individuals, right?
And really thinks about people as people and people as humans and not necessarily just as employees.
And for me, that's always really stuck with me.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me a little bit about what is it like to work for that best boss?
Give me examples.
It's pretty inspiring, to be honest.
I'll give you a few examples.
So as I mentioned, this person is really great at kind of seeing the human, right?
Which I think has been even more important during the pandemic, but was critical even before then, right?
In terms of trying to develop a really strong culture and a really strong team approach.
So I'll give you a few examples.
So one thing that this person does probably better than anyone else I've met personally or professionally is listen.
And I don't mean just listen superficially.
Really listen in here to what's being said.
He believes that good ideas can come from anywhere, right?
Some leaders I find will only listen to other leaders.
Or only listen, and this is unfortunate, but it does still happen from time to time, only listen to males.
And as a female, someone who's always looked younger than I am, I found often in meetings, I would get dismissed, right?
Or just passed over or talked over, or, you know, if it's a vendor who doesn't know the organization, you know, they'll only speak to the male in the room or the person who on the surface appears to be the most senior.
And that's not a great feeling, right?
It can feel pretty crappy when that happens.
This leader never does that.
He truly listens.
He makes a point of acknowledging everybody.
And then what I've observed as well is how actively reflect on the feedback.
Doesn't always get implemented, but he'll actively reflect on what's being said and think about, well, how can we use some of that?
Or can we use a little bit of A and a little bit of C and make something really special out of it, right?
And in my experience, that's being pretty weird.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's interesting.
So I'm just thinking that, first of all, I love what you said.
I just want to reiterate this.
Great ideas can come from anywhere.
I feel like that point, again, like to live that is pretty impressive.
So that's like inclusion at the next level.
So like you said, it's not just listening, just being quiet so somebody else can talk.
It's actually really searching for the meat in somebody's contribution.

Christine Andrew:
Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
And to build on that, I would say one of the things that I've learned is the importance of democratic leadership.
And it's something that I've personally adopted as well in different situations.
And obviously, you can't use that in every single situation.
Sometimes you just need to make a decision and move on.
But when you can use democratic leadership and get input from multiple people and understand multiple perspectives and get input from different parts of the organization and then come to a decision, I find it can do wonders at driving engagement, collaboration, alignment, cohesion within the organization.
And something that this leader has done in particular, which I thought was super smart, was he implemented a reverse mentorship program.
So it's a formal forum for rising stars to provide feedback and input on, you know, it can be specific programs within the organization.
It can be priorities.
If we're struggling with a specific problem, sometimes, you know, he'll throw it out to this table to get input from the, what we call the leaders of tomorrow to get input from this leadership table.
And some really amazing, unique ideas come out of that table.
And I think it's such a smart and inspiring way to approach the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's brilliant.
You know, when I graduated, I went into Chrysler's high potential program.
And they had always said that they wanted all of these really young minds to be our out of the box thinkers.
But one of the challenges that I say is like, you know, as soon as I got in there, everybody would smack me and go get back in the box.
Like, stop talking about, you know, you don't know how business works.
You don't know how things happen yet.
I definitely remember ageism being a bit of a challenge.
I mean, much to your point earlier about looking young, you know, you're getting ageism, which is frustrating.
And so when I hear that, I go, that's a brilliant way to harness all of that creative thinking and all of that energy without having to make those people feel like they have to be pushed back in the box.

Christine Andrew:
Yeah, exactly.
Right.
Great things can happen outside of that box.
You don't need to be in that box.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Right.
And I mean, he's being intentional about that, which is fantastic.
So he's like, I'm going to tap into these people for very specific ideas.
Sure, we'll still go ahead and train them on the stuff that, you know, we need to do to get them to be functional in the organization.
But we can actually tap into that out of the box thinking.
I think that's really cool.
What else do you want to share about this leader?

Christine Andrew:
I think something else that makes this leader really special and unique is his ability to believe in and empower people.
I'll give you a personal example.
I had witnessed this person doing a really great job at, you know, instilling confidence and seeing people's unique talents in other areas of the organization.
But about three and a half years ago, I was leading our national corporate marketing team across the country.
You know, really loved that job, had spent, you know, the first 15 or so years of my career building my craft in marketing communications and building out teams and, you know, had this career map in my mind kind of all laid out in terms of what my future would look like.
And, you know, he came to me and asked me if I would consider changing directions and moving over to help build out our digital area of our business.
And I thought, holy cow, this is silly.
I have no business, you know, building out digital.
I don't have the deep technical knowledge that I thought was really important to be successful in that type of role.
But, you know, he kind of said, well, I know that you can do this and I know that you have the transferable skills needed to succeed, right?
You're great at problem solving.
You're great at building teams.
You have amazing resiliency.
You know, you're good, sometimes too good.
I'm pushing the envelope and wanting to do things differently.
And so he was able to see potential in me that I kind of overlooked myself, to be honest, right?
And helped instill that confidence in me to do something different.
And to be honest, that's been incredibly rewarding.
And if I didn't have that push from him to do something different and do something, you know, kind of scary, to be honest, but also really amazing in terms of the impact on the organization, but also the personal growth for me, I wouldn't have done it, right?
If I didn't have that push from him and if he didn't see that potential in me.
So he's really great at seeing talent in people and giving him the confidence to do things differently.

Christine Laperriere:
I hear that often.
So doing, you know, almost 50 of these interviews, I hear one of the traits that, you know, reoccurs over and over again is that boss that can spot something that nobody else has seen in themselves yet.
And, you know, if you think about it, it completely, first of all, I had a mentor that did that to me.
And I definitely think when I look back on my career, it was the game changer.
It put me on a totally different trajectory.
And I'm so thankful for that.
I think what you just said is the same.
I just interviewed somebody who was, you know, a teacher and literally ended up in a sales role in the financial industry and is a fantastic sales leader.
And it was all because somebody spotted that difference.
So I listened to what you just said and I go, I'm smiling because that's one of the reoccurring themes.

Christine Andrew:
Yeah, and I agree.
I'm so grateful that, you know, he saw that in me and gave me this opportunity.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And it changes the trajectory of your career, right?
It changes what you see in yourself.

Christine Andrew:
And even the potential opportunities for the future, right?
And I would say it's also helped me as a leader really reflect on, you know, yes, this person is doing this role today, but their superpower is really this thing.
So how can we help support them and build that out so that they can be even better in the future?

Christine Laperriere:
And that's great.
So now, and that's one of the best parts too of a best boss is that you start to emulate the thing that you saw in them.
So that now spills over into your leadership, which is to me the best.
That's why I'm so passionate about this topic in the first place, because I believe that it influences so many people over time.

Christine Andrew:
Yeah, absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
So one of the questions that I always love to ask in my world, obviously companies have to invest in their people in order to help build up this type of talent.
And the question that comes up over and over again is what is the return on investment?
So if you had to quantify, if you can, I love to ask this question because most people can, but if you had to quantify what the impact is of working for a best boss ever on the business, on the numbers, what would you say?

Christine Andrew:
That's a great question.
So in terms of quantifying it, I'll do it softly that way.
I will say our organization has had unprecedented growth.
And not only have we had unprecedented growth over the past few years under this person's leadership, it's been through a pandemic, right?
So this person has the ability to put out, you know, what sometimes can appear to be an unachievable vision and motivate people to achieve it, which I think is pretty amazing.
Something else that personally really speaks to me, my values is we have made tremendous advancements when it comes to DEI or diversity equity inclusion in terms of how we think about our organization, how we think about treating each other, again, as human beings within the organization and really challenging each other around some of our assumptions or around some, you know, behaviors that we didn't even realize, you know, we were doing or doing it intentionally.
So, and I don't know if that would have happened if we didn't have somebody like this leader, you know, helping to really move the needle.
We've made, again, tremendous strides when it comes to how we think about mental health and how we approach mental health and the programs that we have for around mental health within the organization.
And it's not just, you know, we have a chief mental health officer, we have a chief diversity and inclusion officer.
It's much bigger than that in terms of embedding these things into our culture and into how we approach our work in each other every day.
That's exciting.
I mean, I'm doing that work and I think that is so important.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's cutting edge, right?
Like the best organizations are investing in that and the rest are waiting to see what the best are doing.

Christine Andrew:
And the thing about this area, it's an area that I'm passionate about and, you know, I do some work on this from a volunteer perspective as well.
It's an area where we're, well, I shouldn't say all of us, but many of us are learning at the same time, right?
I don't know if anyone, you know, the gold star has all the answers.
You know, we're all learning and growing and trying to be better collectively.
And that's one of the reasons why I find the space so fascinating and important, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
It's an unchartered territory.
We just know it's time.

Christine Andrew:
Exactly.
It is past time, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it is past time.
That's amazing.
So when you've worked for a not best boss, one that maybe wasn't as inspiring for you, what were the kind of things that happened, again, share some examples and some stories, but what didn't work for you personally?

Christine Andrew:
This is a tricky one.
I've been fortunate where I've worked with a lot of amazing people, but I would say if, you know, you have a day that was less than awesome, there were kind of common themes, right?
And it typically would come down to not feeling respected, either not being respected for, you know, ideas and contributions, not feeling like your time is being respected, not feeling like your values are being respected, you know, not feeling like I was being respected as a human being.
So it's almost the opposite of what I described previously in terms of not feeling seen or respected.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, like, how do people do that?
Let's say maybe even accidentally, right?
So most leaders don't think that they're not respectful.
That's a thing.
Like, well, I'm coaching most leaders.
They're not saying, oh, I'm not respectful.
Most think that they are.
But I think sometimes that's a blind spot.
So can you just tell me, like, an example, like, what kind of things make you feel that way?

Christine Andrew:
You know, a simple one, because it's not really simple, but because I touched on it earlier, would be the listening.
But I think being people-oriented, not task-oriented, right?
And so task-oriented for me would be, you know, focused on the outcomes, focused on the deliverable, which are absolutely important.
Don't get me wrong.
Absolutely important.
But focusing on the task without focusing on the people, that's, I find, where the respect boundaries can get a little bit blurry, right?
Where, you know, if someone, for example, has a personal boundary, right?
Or they have a personal commitment.
And if it's only task-focused, outcome-focused, somebody might overlook that unintentionally, to your point, unintentionally overlook that.
And that's where I find, you know, feelings could get hurt, values could get stepped on, et cetera.

Christine Laperriere:
That makes a lot of sense to me.
I'm having my own aha moment as I'm listening to you.
I was just thinking about someone that was very task-oriented, who kept challenging me to work with their leaders at eight in the morning.
And I kept saying, I have two young kids at home, and they're not out the door until nine.
So it's a lot of anxiety for me to work during that hour when there's a lot of background noise and there's my concern of not being able to deliver at my best.
And so it was just, it was so interesting, though, because it was a battle.
Like, this person didn't understand this, so we had to go back and forth quite a bit.
And I kept feeling very unvalued, and I didn't know what it was, but it just like dawned on me when you said it to me.
I'm like, that was the difference.
It's like the person wasn't intentionally trying to be disrespectful, but it kept making me feel like something was missed, right?
And so task oriented versus people oriented, people oriented would have been, hey, we can definitely work around that one hour.
Let's find a solution where you can bring your best without it having to be in conflict with whatever's happening at home.
Yeah, exactly.
That's very, very great insight.

Christine Andrew:
Yeah.
And I think you raised a really important point that sparked for me is that that's how you really get the best out of people, right?
You would have been distracted, probably stressed, trying to manage this executive call at eight in the morning with little kids making noise in the background and trying to get off to school.
Whereas if it started at nine or nine thirty, you would have done a much better job at the task because the person was taken care of.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And that's exactly it.
You know, it was just, it's such an interesting thing where I'm like, I know my performance is going to be X versus Y, and I want to give you Y.
Like, I want to give you the best me, right?

Christine Andrew:
And most people do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Christine Andrew:
Most people want to give the best that they can.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Christine Andrew:
So we just need to help them get there, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.
That's a great example of, and I think I can really picture different examples where, just like you said, it's not that the task is not important.
It's just being able to combine the two ideas and then navigate some great solutions that incorporate both.
Amazing.
I really like that.
So that's a little bit about, you know, let's say the example of, you know, maybe the not best.
A lot of people who listen to the show are trying to figure out how to sharpen the saw in their own leadership skills.
So I would just say kind of in a closing, if you had to teach or advise future leaders on, you know, how to be a best boss, what would you tell them to focus on?

Christine Andrew:
This is tricky because I, I am still on my own journey to be the best boss, right?
As I think many of us are.
I don't think it's ever something that you, you know, you get that, you know, report card where you're finally the best boss, right?
I think we're always kind of learning and growing and developing and trying to get better over time.
But a few things have stuck with me.
So one, I would say kind of lead with empathy and be human centric because like at the end of the day, we're all humans, right?
And consider that whole person and not just the employee.
He kind of says kind of almost humorously but it really sticks with me is he talks about leaving positive cookies, right?
And so, and what he means by positive cookies is always leave somebody with something positive from the interaction, right?
Like whether it's a word of encouragement or a compliment or, you know, advice or guidance or even a link to an interesting article, right?
But just think about leading a positive cookie and something positive about the interaction so that they'll kind of leave the conversation, you know, energized and have that positive frame of mind.
So that's always really stuck with me.
And that's something actually this leader is being excellent at is just bringing a sense of humor to interactions.
You know, he's very, and this is hard given some of the, you know, tricky situations.
But, you know, no matter how serious the topic or how tricky the situation or, you know, the severity of the problem he'll find a way to make people smile, right?
And just add a little bit humor and positivity or focus on, you know what?
Yes, like this thing, and these are my words you would never say it this way but this thing really sucks, right?
It's hard, it sucks.
But, you know, we're gonna get it to a better place.
You know, there's a better future.
There's this positive outcome, this positive silver lining.
So really thinking about the positive aspect of things and having more of an optimistic frame of mind.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
And I mean, that mindset's so big and we know it but again, to live it is a little different.
So what does it look like?
Just like you said, so being in a meeting.
I love this idea of leaving positive cookies.
And this is what I was trying to get at with the show is like, what are those little things that a great leader does?
Not the big kind of obvious stuff.
We've all read about a lot of these topics and we're all thinking that we're doing them but there's something, there's a quality to a really great leader that it's more nuanced.
And so to me, that's such an example.
In a meeting, it's like thinking about leaving the positive cookie, right?
Or like, you know, just- 

Christine Andrew:
What can't you find on Google?
What's that leadership tip that you can't find on Google?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, I think that's exactly it, right?
It's not tactical.
It's where leadership is an art.
And that's, you know, he obviously knows how to find that little piece of art in the moment and nobody gave him that in a Harvard Business Review article.

Christine Andrew:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's a great close today.
So we'll challenge everybody as they leave to think about where in their work world they can leave positive cookies behind for people that interact with them.
So they can leave that meeting feeling that little bit of optimism or that little bit of positivity that would help energize them and keep them going.

Christine Andrew:
Because it's contagious, right?
I'll leave this conversation with you in a positive mindset because we had so much fun.
And then that'll cascade to my next meeting, right?
So it is, it's contagious.

Christine Laperriere:
It is contagious and that's the best part.
That's what I love about culture in the first place, right?
Is that these little things matter, right?
And then you go home at the end of the day and you're talking to your kids and you have a better frame of mind just because your day was better, right?
So listen, Christine, this was a fantastic interview.
Thank you so much.

Christine Andrew:
Thank you so much.
I really enjoyed it.
It was a pleasure to be on your show.

Title: Don't pretend you don't have a life
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Elise Steffe

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have on one of my besties, Elise Steffe.
And Elise, it's so cool because every time that we catch up, so many times you end up telling me about this great boss that you're working for.
And so even though I felt like it was a little bit of favoritism to invite you on the show, every time that you would tell me a story about this woman that you're currently working for, I'd go, this is what I'm talking about.
I get so excited.
And it was so much fun to talk with you about this leader that I couldn't help.
But I finally said, enough is enough.
You have to be a guest, even though there's a little bit of favoritism in here.
So thank you for being on the show, Elise.

Elise Steffe:
Thank you for having me.
I appreciate the opportunity and I appreciate you shining spotlight on nonprofit management because I really, truly believe that there's quite a bit of overlap.
Leadership and office organizations are kind of the same.
Nonprofits are just doing it with a lot less resources and fewer staff.
But it's all the same thing.
So I appreciate you adding that into your special podcast.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
Give everybody just a really quick insight into the work that you do today.

Elise Steffe:
Sure.
So I am working for an organization called Special Gifts Theater, and we do inclusive and adaptive performing arts programming for individuals that have developmental and cognitive disabilities.
So we're the only program in the Chicago area that's educationally and therapeutically based.
So we have around 300 students and peer mentors.
We have 11 live performances each year and seven different locations in Chicago and the northern suburbs, mostly musical theater.
We also offer dance and improv and it's just a highly adapted program.
Every element from costume script, the goal is for the student actor to be successful and the focus is on their abilities and not their disabilities.
And ultimately, we believe that the skills that they're working on in our programming will help them to just live more fully, be accepted and more confident in the communities that they live in.

Christine Laperriere:
My God, I'm getting choked up.

Elise Steffe:
Great program.

Christine Laperriere:
What an incredible impact.
And I bet those students really appreciate all of the work that you and your organization do.

Elise Steffe:
I think they do.
I mean, we're really serving the entire family and our peer mentors are receiving high level inclusive and disability awareness training.
And we actually have quite a few of them that end up, well, they stay with us.
They start at 12 and a lot of them will stay with us through high school graduation.
And quite a few of them decide to pursue careers in special education.
And the various occupational and physical therapy programs.
And the others, in my opinion, are future decision makers and leaders in the corporate world and the experience that they've had here.
They understand that people can come with lots of different abilities and they'll be making decisions on allowing people with different types of abilities to join the workforce.
So long run, I think we're doing great stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
It's amazing.
So I'm just going to give a little bit of frame.
You and I had talked, obviously, about your career over the years.
And one of the things that I thought was so upsetting in some ways was that you had this incredible start to a really strong career in business arts.
You worked for some fantastic organizations.
And then you had two Matt Leaves and brought two sons into the world.
And now you have these two amazing boys that are kind of in their preteen years.
And truth be told, you take on the day-to-day domestic care of those boys, right?
They need you for sports and for all those things.
And so I remember us talking at one point and you just feeling so frustrated because the career opportunities were always this difficult fit.
It either required an incredible amount of commuting.
It required you to have to delegate care off to some other person for your boys.
And it just seemed like the work world wasn't suited for you anymore.
But for me, that was always such a struggle because you're so talented.
And I kept going, how have we not created the right type of work environment for somebody with so much talent and so much skill?
I mean, this was your educational background, too.
It's not just a hobby for you.
This is your career.
So anyway, so now you start this role with this current leader, and it just feels like things have shifted so much.
So go ahead.
Tell us about this best boss.

Elise Steffe:
Sure.
So I actually started in November 2020, the height of the pandemic.
I interviewed over Zoom.
I actually didn't work in person with anyone in our staff until I'm going to say six to eight months later, once we all had had the vaccinations and it felt safe enough to get together.
So even with those elements, I just felt like my onboarding and my relationship, my connection with her and the rest of the team was just, it was so much quicker than in other organizations.
And we just developed a rapport really quickly.
And I believe it's because she is such a good leader and so focused on communication and building this team.
We actually all work remotely, the operations team.
I think perhaps they didn't have such a bad adjustment to teleconferencing because we had those elements, but we hold really regular staff meetings.
I have two meetings a week and she's really, really open to sharing information.
I just feel like I have what I need to do the job that I was hired to do.
So yeah, I guess that's the first thing.
Just really excellent leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, tell some of those stories.
Like I said, I feel like every time we talk, you share another little what a week at work is like for you.
Share some of those.

Elise Steffe:
Yeah.
So I think the first theme that I had while I was preparing for this was trust and respect.
And I just feel more trusted and more respected than I have kind of in all elements than in previous positions.
And I will say that I've had a wonderful career and wonderful leadership throughout my career.
So I'm thankful to all of them.
But one of the first things that I noticed is she literally said the words family first, one of our staff meetings kind of early on.
I just, I've never heard anyone in leadership say that family first, that we're actually going to say those words out loud.
She has young children and I have young teens.
And the other people on our teams, two of them have adult children with disabilities that work.
So they have responsibilities to drive them places and care for them.
And some of them have elder care and grandchildren, all types of things.
So it's kind of like at all different levels, we all have things we need to do.
And I'm going to call it not distractions, but just other things involved.
So from the beginning, first of all, we had a good relationship where I understood her place because I know how hard that was to deal with the morning, getting everyone out of the house to the nanny or childcare.
I don't have that anymore.
My craziness is ahead of in like the early afternoon and evenings for the activities that my boys are in.
But we're able to talk about it.
We don't have to pretend that it doesn't exist.
And we adjust all the time.
If the meeting was scheduled for nine, you just kind of can center yourself.
If it's at 10, then we do it at 10, and vice versa at the other end of the time to just know that it is part of a working environment to be so flexible like that and acknowledge it.
I really think that everyone on our team appreciates that because your time and value is respected.
And I've told you many times, I think that this is the best run organization for this size.
It's a small nonprofit that I've been involved with.
I think it is the best run organization and multiple levels.
I've told all the board members that I've worked with on that.
And I could list many, many reasons, but I just think this kind of connection to actually caring about your colleagues and just really approaching this, that it doesn't need to be so rigid about the working hours.
I mean, I actually was hired and in the job description, it was flexibility.
And that was really, really key because even with young teens, I would like to be available to be around and kind of work around their schedules.
And it works.
And we're getting amazing things done.
We've been able to really grow our operating budget and our fundraising over the last couple of years.
And yes, I do think that I have been able to contribute, but I really think a lot of it is because we just have an environment where people are working together and there's no hard feelings or, you know, you're not going into it with communication problems.
I think we have a lot of really hard work that we do every single day for this organization, but it's not because of fumbles with communication and ego or, you know, none of that.
It's hard work because it's really, really hard and we're trying to make miracles happen on a little tiny budget.

Christine Laperriere:
I just want to point something out.
So what I love about this, this idea of family first.
Now I have heard many leaders say that, but I don't know if I've seen many leaders know how to embody that.
And so I really hear something very different, which is when I say family first, I really mean it.
There's zero consequence for you having another outside responsibility.
We're going to figure out how to use that as part of the way we organize the game, you know, and we're going to block and tackle and pivot because it's the work that matters and not these subjective guidelines that, you know, you have to be here at this time or else.
So it's really neat to hear because like I said, I just hear the difference between the mantra versus the actual execution of it, especially with an entire team.
So it's not even like she's giving you this special flexibility.

Elise Steffe:
Right.
Absolutely not.
Everyone needs it.
I mean, even if you just need, you know, a doctor's appointment or something, I feel like in the past, early on in the career, it was a big deal to kind of ask, like, I need to take Friday to go to it.
And just, no, just do it, just go.
And we're just, we're no longer pretending that we don't have these other elements.
And I don't want it to be completely, you know, gender-focused, but I guess anecdotally, it feels like it still seems to fall on the women and families that are figuring out all of this stuff, even if they're full-time or part-time, just, you know, everything with the kids.
And, you know, both, we both have partners, husbands that are very actively involved with the childcare, but it's still, I can just still see it's, you know, it's a default, like mom seems to be the one that's running the schedule.
And I just think more women in leadership and we don't have to play the game that we did before.
And also, you know, women of our age, we were just sort of told to do it all and have this career and have that, but the support is not there.
You know, I mean, I did have, when my children were born, I was very, very lucky to have really the highest quality childcare that was available, that was actually through my employer.
And I had a family medical leave that I was able to take.
So I got my, you know, whatever it was, 12 weeks.
But what they, what they don't tell you is that they keep taking your PTO.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is paid time off.

Elise Steffe:
Right.
And this has happened to many other women that I know.
It's paid time off and then it's taken so that you come back after having a child after 12 weeks, if you're lucky to get 12 weeks, and then you have to put them in a childcare facility and you have no PTO at all, zero, absolutely zero, right?
So you have to come back into this environment where you know your child's going to build their immune system and get sick immediately.
And that stress is just, you know, it's just so difficult.
And then you're supposed to pretend like you are not stressed out about all of these things that you, you know, you have going on.
And I have a lot of hope and confidence for, you know, the changes that are happening now.
And, you know, our children, that they're all of this silliness of no support and pretending that these other factors are not in place.
They think that hopefully that'll just go away.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's intense.
Okay.
Give me some more meat on this leader.

Elise Steffe:
Yeah.
So the next little element I have is I believe she leaves room for the magic.
Oh, I forgot to mention that too.
So we have a couple of mantras that we use.
So one of them that goes along with this is dream, achieve, believe.
So this is just, these are words that we use for branding.
And we also just infuse it to, you know, build confidence with our students that are participating.
We're trying to do a lot at this place.
They hired me to be the first professional fundraiser and to build out the fundraising program that was already in really good shape, I think, going into it from her leadership and the rest of the staff that were doing elements of fundraising.
But I was able to kind of come in and, you know, try to fine tune and grow all of it.
It kind of goes back to the first thing I said, trust and respect.
I was able to kind of, you know, break down and make suggestions for all of these things.
And she was, you know, truly open to it.
It's like, oh, we can make these changes.
We can enhance this.
Let's try this.
Let's try that.
But we're at a point now, post-pandemic, we actually did really well through the pandemic and, you know, more or less, I guess we're out of it and our programming is back to in-person.
So we're at a place with a new strategic plan where we're in a growth phase and kind of looking at the next steps.
And then myself as a fundraiser, my job is to figure out how to convince, you know, the rest of the world to believe in special gifts theater and to, you know, to support us, right?
We are, 75% of our operating budget comes from fundraising.
We're committed to very low tuition rates because we understand that, you know, our community has lots of additional expenses because they have a child with disabilities.
So we're committed to that.
75%, we have to come up with fundraising.
So I have to find all of these reasons, right, of why we want to support this place.
So when we're talking about it and kind of thinking the really big picture, you have to have room for brainstorming.
You have to be able to think really, really big pie in the sky, almost impossible, right?
And she leaves time in our interactions and our meetings for these really big, I'm gonna call them impossible ideas.
And there's no bad idea, like we can just really, really think big.
And like, I mean, honestly, just leaving room for that instead of just 100% focused on like what we have to do today.
I just personally have experienced many times when you're really trying to think big and getting into like, you know, the future vision, the answer is always no, we can't do it.
We don't have the resources.
We don't have this.
We don't have that.
And instead of it going into like a panic, no, it's, well, let's talk about it and let's think we just have like a really good collaboration where we can like get into this thinking big and future plans.
And then once we kind of have this vision, we're really able to work well together to kind of drill down and be like, okay, what are the steps that are possible or how can we pitch this to the rest of the staff or to the board or, you know, whatever the case is.
So I personally really appreciate that.
And you just, you want to have people feel comfortable kind of thinking big.
And not all of the ideas are great, but they, so far for the last two years working with her, we're moving in the right direction.
And I think it's worth it.
And I appreciate even with a hundred things going on, she doesn't need to do that.
I personally think that a leader should remember that they need that time.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, and I have to say too, like having known you, so it's neat because I have such a different context because I've known you for all these years.
And I've known at times that you've been in positions where you had a lot of great ideas.
Like we'd be talking about all the things that you thought were great ideas, but it didn't sound like there was a spot for them at work.
So you and I would talk about them offline and it sounds so different now because she's gaining the benefit of that.
Like you're a very creative thinker and she's gaining all the value of that instead of what used to be the case where, you know, when we'd go for a walk and we'd be talking about work or whatever, you'd go, oh God, I wish they would think about this.
I wish they would consider this.
And I feel like that was just a talk for, talking shop outside of work, right?
She's gained all the value of that, which is incredible just by making space for it.

Elise Steffe:
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's wonderful.
It makes it a comfortable and inviting workplace.
I absolutely love working with this team.
All of them, you know, her included, we just are getting things done and it's just this really supportive, connected, respected working environment.

Christine Laperriere:
And so what was the other, there was like a third theme, right?

Elise Steffe:
Yeah.
The third one was ability to seek resources and our mantra that we use in the organization right now is creative adaptation is at the core of what we do.
So we're doing adaptive theater and we're doing it creatively.
But I thought, wow, how those two things go together.
So as a leader and as of a growing nonprofit that is very tiny, I think sometimes it's, you know, hard to be like, well, we don't know the answers and we need resources for this.
We need to have other people help and when you have other help, it's hard not to, you know, maybe feel a little self-critical or, you know, just kind of like those elements.
So yeah, under my time the last two years, we're on our third consulting project with the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
So we're working with MBA candidates and we're just working on various elements for, you know, business improvement with them, which, you know, that takes a ton of time, number one for her to extend herself to be, you know, part of this group and meetings, et cetera.
And then, you know, when we're getting the information and the consultant suggestions, she also has the ability to say, these are all fantastic ideas and I wish we could do all of them.
But if we try to do all of these, right, we're gonna burn out.
We just don't have the ability.
We have to kind of like tear this down to a small nonprofit with really dedicated staff, but we need to, you know, take care of the whole person, right?
Because, you know, in my experience, I've worked in nonprofit forever.
People are not motivated by, you know, a potential bonus possible trip to Hawaii at the end of the year or a big giant cash bonus the end of the year that just doesn't happen.
So they're motivated by passion and their heart, right?
For whatever nonprofit they're involved with and they're not doing it for the money.
They're not doing it for a cushy office.
All those things are just, it's just not an option.
So you just, you need to kind of, I think, really watch burnout possibly even more than in a corporate setting because as a leader of a nonprofit, as an exec, she's the executive director, you have to, during the day, you're gonna be working on this budgets and you're gonna be preparing for, you know, million dollar asks, but you also need to empty the garbage sometimes.
And you have to just sort of like check your ego that you're gonna do all of that, you know, type of work.
So she's able to do that.
Also doing another, a second project with Rush University for their doctoral program for occupational therapy.
So anyway, just bringing on, you know, all of these different resources and doing a strategic plan and, you know, of course I've kind of said it earlier, but being willing to bring on a professional fundraiser and allowing me to make suggestions and I can tell she actually really wants my opinion.
And you know, we're implementing all of it and it's working.
We're seeing the difference in the results in our fundraising efforts.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And then I have to bring in one last thing and, you know, you feel free to share what you can, but I also know from our conversations that she has been proactive in rewarding you and thanking you and getting the board to reach out and thank you for great work.
Like, you know, the recognition, she just, you know, I was really touched the one day when you talked about just getting proactive recognition for an incredible job that you've done.
It's so refreshing to hear where somebody, you know, so you tell the story, I guess, I'll let you tell the story.

Elise Steffe:
Sure, I mean, the first thing I'll say is, you know, it's an environment where you do receive positive feedback and I think so many places, right, you're only getting feedback on, you know, areas of improvement.
But one of the things that she said to me, which really warmed my heart was, she said that she thinks that I'm a really good, big picture, visionary person, like the big picture, but I'm also able to like drill down.
And it was one of our meetings over Zoom.
We do try to meet as much as we can in person now that we safely can do that.
But when she was doing that, it was like the heart, like she was like a big picture and then you can also drill down.
I'm like, oh, that's, I'm a heart.
And she was like, yes, you're a heart.
It's so cute, but it was so nice to be recognized, you know, for that kind of talent that can't really, be drilled down a little bit.
But yeah, so I'm going on two years and I didn't seek it out, but I've, you know, been given a promotion and compensation for recognizing that I've been going a little bit over the hours that we agreed on.
And, you know, I just really appreciate, I feel valued.
And besides it just being a really incredible supportive working environment, I just feel really appreciated, especially in a nonprofit setting to kind of recognize, you know, extra effort and time.

Christine Laperriere:
It's so cool.
And I mean, I'm just going to give that little point of like, you know, you were going above and beyond and instead of you having to go in and ask for recognition or ask for, you know, what you wanted, which is most of the time, like as a leadership coach, I'm helping people advocate sometimes when they are going above and beyond.
What I think it's really neat is she recognized it, pulled you into her office and said, hey, you are going above and beyond.
I'd like to talk about how we can recognize you for that.
And I just think, wow, how refreshing.

Elise Steffe:
Yes.
I also think too, I don't know, you know, where it fits in, but for me personally, and I believe it's for the rest of the team as well, she's identified where people have strengths and talents and interests, right?
So I've been able to be involved with elements that fall out of my job description, which is the money grabber, right?
And so I've gotten involved with like the strategic plan and some more work with like marketing and communications.
And I just absolutely love it.
It's like this wonderful opportunity to, it makes me feel a little bit more inspired.
And, you know, I also think that I being willing to share kind of all elements and involving people and things that are a little bit outside of their job description, it just makes their job easier because you kind of understand the big picture.
At least for me, I need to kind of know why we're doing something and where all the elements are thinking back to past leaders that I've had, the ones that were willing to share information, invite you to a meeting that maybe technically you didn't need to be at.
It's inspiring, it's motivating, but it just makes things easier when you kind of understand what an organization is trying to do.
So I appreciate that.

Christine Laperriere:
So just real quick, I have kind of two last questions for you.
So the first is, in my business, people are always asking what's the return on investment for having a best boss, right?
Because they're investing in me and work with their leaders.
When you think of the business case that I'm usually trying to prove, what is the return on investment for working for a best boss right now?

Elise Steffe:
Well, I think that I am 100% focused on helping to improve the organization.
I don't have to spend any time at all sort of doing like a mind scramble of what exactly did we say?
Did we communicate that right?
Or is there information I'm not being told?
None of that.
It just feels very clear so we can kind of literally get down to business when we're talking.
We have fun together.
I really enjoy her.
I think she enjoys me as a person.
And yeah, I feel more motivated.
We want this organization to succeed or we're on the same team.
And sometimes I think you don't always feel like you're on the same team.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, it sounds kind of like a mental and emotional efficiency because there's not a lot of wondering.
You're definitely not scared of whether or not your kid gets sick.
Are you going to be in trouble with your team?

Elise Steffe:
No, it's all gone.
Yeah, I can't imagine going back to an environment where I had to pretend that those elements exist or I just feel really tired and I can't think today.
I mean, there's a lot of times, you know, well, not a lot, but once in a while we'll be like, can we do this project next week because I feel exhausted or she'll say I need to think about something else.
And then it's so much better next week when we're or tomorrow or whatever it is when we're feeling a little bit more refreshed.
You just don't need to be perfect.
And I think that's kind of pre-pandemic, you know, earlier versions of working environments, you just need to be perfect all the time because you're afraid.
It's fear.
So I think it's a fear-based thing, right?
You just don't want to show any signs of weakness.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, yeah.
And it just sounds again, she sounds like she's winning the inclusion route, which I mean, it's so neat because the organization is obviously that's the central value of the organization.
And then it's neat to hear the story of this leader who is actually really living like there can be nothing about you that makes you unacceptable if you're ready to roll up your sleeves and get down to work.
So you're truly on a highly inclusive team.

Elise Steffe:
Definitely.
It's a great team.
I'm honestly just so happy to be there and I love seeing this organization grow and I'm just really excited to kind of help mold the next phase for the next 20 years of this organization.

Christine Laperriere:
You did mention another leader that you worked for pre-pandemic days and just some of the mantras that this leader kind of used to repeat and repeat.

Elise Steffe:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And so I have to ask for the Steve-isms.
Can you give me some of the Steve-isms?

Elise Steffe:
Yes.
Yes, definitely.
Yes, I was very fortunate to work under the leadership of Stephen Falk.
He was the president of Northwestern Memorial Foundation.
So that's the fundraising arm of Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.
He was a wonderful, wonderful leader.
It was a much different organization.
It was a team of, I think we had 40 people and we were raising 20 to 30 million a year.
It was very different than this place.
But I was kind of thinking about why was he such a great leader?
And you would go into staff meetings which he did have regularly.
He did a really, really great job of sharing, everyone was invited, admins all the way up to his vice president, major gift officers.
They were all invited to the staff meeting and he did a great job of sharing what the goals were and how we were going to do them.
And this huge task of raising all of this money and he would ask for a lot of feedback.
I think he probably already knew what the answer was, but he at least created an environment where everyone, admins, interns included, were allowed to make suggestions on how we were doing that.
He made the goal and the reason why very, very clear when we were doing medical fundraising and it was for things that were not available.
So a lot of research, a lot of just, you know, special projects and initiatives that our lab researchers and our physicians, you know, needed funding on.
So anyway, you would leave these meetings and you somehow wanted to work harder, right?
Like he would just leave you.
Was there a spell put on us?
He was definitely a very hard worker, you know, there before anyone else.
But he did, I think, also make sure that you felt part of the team.
He held with his senior management what he called compass meetings.
So they would go off campus to lunch, I think maybe once a month or twice a month and, you know, individually compass up as he liked to call it.
So anyway, he was a great leader.
He's recently retired and I'm just very grateful to have had the chance to work with him.
But yeah, so he had these, what we called Steve-isms in the office, but they're super fun.
So, okay, the first one was, is this the hill you want to die on, right?
So he would tell you that every time that maybe you were, you know, letting your ego get in the way or just a little bit too connected with something.
The next one was, cemeteries are full of people who thought they were irreplaceable.

Christine Laperriere:
I just love that.

Elise Steffe:
I mean, maybe a little bit.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it.

Elise Steffe:
A little bit fear-based, I think.
I don't know how well that would work now, but I also kind of made you think like, you know, it's a good point.

Christine Laperriere:
It's literally true, right?
It's true.

Elise Steffe:
You're not that important.
There's someone else and especially working in a hospital environment, like, well, maybe the only one that's not irreplaceable is the, you know, brain surgeon or something like that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Elise Steffe:
There's not that many of them that know this like specific technique to remove a brain tumor.
But the rest of us, you know, Yeah.
We're replaceable.

Christine Laperriere:
We could be swapped out.

Elise Steffe:
Yeah.
The next one was go to every dance.
Okay, so that was, you know, in a fundraising sense that you never know where your next donor is and any invitation you went and you went to the dance and he, in a patient environment, you know, he obviously there's a lot of people with money in Chicago, but, you know, it was kind of like, don't judge a book by a cover.
You don't know, you know, where your next relationship is going to come from.
So I definitely still use that one a lot or at least try to think about it.
Like go to as many dances as you can as long as you have kid coverage, I guess.
Okay, so the next one is stay loose, right?
So I still try to use that now and I use that really through the whole school from home with my kids and not knowing what the next day was going to bring.
Like we've got to stay loose.
We've got to stay loose.
Like we don't know.
Like we cannot be rigid right now.
This kind of goes with that.
Bend like a reed, right?

Christine Laperriere:
I think bend like a reed makes me giggle.

Elise Steffe:
Flexibility, yeah, like a reed.
So just, you know, just remember in staff meetings or something, someone's butt, butt, butt and you'll be like bend like a reed, right?
Like we need to go with the flow.
Things are out of our element, right?
We can't do that.
All right, so then the next two are broad brush strokes.
So you'd be in a meeting and you get too much and he just hands up broad brush strokes.
Okay, we got to take it up.
And then you're in the weeds, go to 10,000 feet, right?
So like how much with that of our, you know, I'm thinking about it now, like are we providing too much information?
Does the donor really care that we have all these different elements of, you know, how it's therapeutically based?
Or so I'm trying to use that or who's the audience that we're trying to talk to?
Is it replying for a grant or is it an individual?
And then the last one was if you're on time, you are late, right?
So you had that staff meeting, you know, you could start at one, you really should have been comfortably in your seat at, you know, 1255.

Christine Laperriere:
Like I said, this is the only Steve-ism that I would disagree with.
I'm like, I'm so about efficiency that I'm like right on time.
I'm never early and I'm never late.
I'm always right on time.

Elise Steffe:
Yeah, definitely.
So I've shared some of those with my staff now and, you know, you'll hear people kind of mention that like, well, is this a go to every dance or is this too much for us to handle?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, you know, I mean, what's cool about that, though, is I noticed when leaders use mantras like that, first of all, again, they become part of the cultural fabric.
Number two, as long as that leader lives those same mantras, right?
And so that's when they stick, like when you really see them stick.
But what's cool is again, when you can repeat them off the top of your head, like you know the values of that leader and you're living in them because you're in a meeting that Steve's not in and you're like, you know, okay, are we in the weeds?
Like, stay loose, everybody.
Like, so you're actually living and he's given you these great like verbal nuggets.
They're like two to five words max, right?
Where they're quickly repeatable.
They send everybody in one direction.
I just, I love that.
I like Steve-isms and I think they're fantastic.

Elise Steffe:
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

Christine Laperriere:
Listen, this was so much fun.
Thank you so much for sharing about these two fantastic leaders.
And I'm just grinning ear to ear because again, I saw so much potential for you and it just, it used to bum me out to wonder like, who's gonna get an opportunity to take advantage of all this great genius that you have?
Because you are, you're such a hard worker but you're also a creative big picture person.
So you have all these skills.
And I was just like, it's not fair that being a mom and having responsibility at home doesn't provide you a chance to bring all that value to the world.

Elise Steffe:
Yes, well, thank you for having me on.
This was really fun.

Episode: 42
Title: Who's the boss?
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Michael Pilla

Christine Laperriere:
Now, today I'm excited because I have Michael Pilla on the show.
And what's really neat is as the show has gained popularity, I'm getting people who are reaching out to me and actually saying, hey, I actually have a best boss that I really want to talk about.
And so I'm excited because even though Michael and I haven't worked together, he thought of somebody and instantly felt like this was the right place to talk about it.
So, Michael, first of all, please introduce yourself and thank you so much for coming on the show.
Thank you.

Michael Pilla:
Thank you, Christine.
My name is Michael Pilla.
The name of my firm is Pilla Creative Marketing.
We are a digital marketing firm providing branding and content development for web, social, and email.
We have a very, very broad practice, although lately we've been focusing more on arts and culture organizations.
It's more or less a passion project for me.
A lot of arts and cultural organizations have taken a beating during the COVID situation, so I would really like to help them all get sort of back up and running.

Christine Laperriere:
Great.
Great.
That's a great area to focus on.
I'm just going to dive in.
When you heard the name of the show, what was the boss that came to mind for you?

Michael Pilla:
Well, there was two.
There were my first two bosses.
My first job was at a children's publishing company, and I was like an illustration major just out of college.
And after bumping around for a year, I decided I needed a job.
I had been seeing art directors for illustration work, and I sent out a whole bunch of letters, Xerox letters, to the art directors I had met while I was looking for illustration work.
And this woman named Barry got in touch with me and said, Hi, you know, I remember sending out letters like this when I got out of school.
So we sort of had a connection in that way.
So she sort of guided me through the interview process.
And it really wasn't much of a process because I was a low level designer.
But she basically took me in, took me under her wing for a while, sort of really got me started in the design business, showed me about scheduling deadlines, what it was like to work part of a team.
And then just as everything was going really, really well, she left to go get another job.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, no.

Michael Pilla:
Right.
Now, you would think that would be the end of the story, but we actually kept in touch for a good 15, 20 years after that.
We'd have lunch occasionally.
She became something of a mentor to me.
We became friends on a certain level.
And down the road, she was able to give me some very important projects.
She got a job with a huge trade publication company.
So I was able to design several magazines for her.
She actually gave me my first website job, a job with a fabric company.
And she was basically trying to get them into the 20th century.
So she handed me their first major website.
And I had been sort of fooling around with websites, as everybody did back then, just sort of like in the 90s.
Everybody was fooling around with websites, but she trusted me enough to hand me their first big web project.
So in a sense, she gave me two first jobs.
She gave me my first real job in the business, and then she sort of launched my web career with that job.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
When you're thinking about even that first job that she gave you, you were probably trying to navigate that environment and you probably didn't know a lot at that point.
What did she do to kind of help guide you along the way?

Michael Pilla:
She was like, again, she sort of took me under her wing and she sort of explained a little bit of the office politics, that it wasn't just designing nice things, it was how to deal with certain situations and certain people.
Children's publishing looks like a lot of fun and it is a lot of fun from the outside, but there's a lot of sensitivity on the inside.
So that's so much politics.
But people are very, very sensitive as to the messages you're putting out.
And a lot of messages have factions, shall we say.
And if you have one really good story, is we were doing one of these sports characters in a particular feature of the magazine, one that represented by a certain sports character.
So we hired a caricatrist who did a really good caricature of O.J.
Simpson.
This is before O.J.
Simpson was O.J.
Simpson.
But there was a group of parents who objected to the caricature.
And they didn't like, his ears were funny, his cheekbones were funny, and they basically thought we were making fun of African-Americans to be blunt with caricature.
So we had a meeting with them and we ended up having to change it.

Christine Laperriere:
Did she give you some coaching on that then?

Michael Pilla:
Yes, definitely.
Well, it was just interesting to see how something that was really so innocent could just really sort of blow out of proportions on a children's magazine.
This is the New York Times or anything.

Christine Laperriere:
But it makes sense, right?
You need to know your audience and know how things are going to impact them.
So that makes sense.

Michael Pilla:
That's what I learned basically, is know your audience.
It's a classic, but it never goes away.
And know your audience.

Christine Laperriere:
You said there were two bosses that came to mind.

Michael Pilla:
Yeah, the second major job I got was with a direct mail publisher.
And she hired me as her assistant.
Direct mail back then was very, very hectic.
We would do all our Christmas promotion in July.
And even though I started out as pretty much like a production person, I kept trying to work up into doing more design work.
And she saw that.
And at one point she first shared with and then practically handed me a particular section of their direct mail package.
It was something referred to as an enclosure.
So we had a catalog, which were the main items.
And then the enclosures were items that wanted a feature.
When I started taking over, the enclosures started to outsell the catalog.
Oh, wow.
It was a book.
It was an online book publisher.
And I like to tell people the innovation I brought to the job was that I read the books.

Christine Laperriere:
That was the secret.

Michael Pilla:
Well, I treated each book like it was a separate market.
So if it was a mystery book, and what kind of mystery book is, and then let's design an ad or whatever that would appeal to people who like mystery books, that kind of stuff.
She gave me a lot of leeway.
As long as I wasn't doing anything stupid, she basically let me go my own way and do what I will with those projects.
And there was a few times where I tripped up, I made some mistakes, stupid mistakes, but she was always behind me.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.
So tell me about the stupid mistakes.
Things like typos, things like missing a deadline, just like kid stuff, really.
But instead of turning it into a tragedy, someone else would have used that as an excuse to sort of pull work away from me.
But she just reprimanded me, told me not to do it again, and we just sort of moved forward from there.
Towards the end, this is how long ago this was.
They really started to get interested.
Actually, I kind of nudged them in that direction to go out and buy a Mac.
It was one of the first Macs.
So one of the last things I did for them was to help them set up an internal electronic publishing capability.
It was very, very rudimentary compared to what you can do today.
But back then, this was like we discovered fire.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It was a big deal.

Michael Pilla:
And again, they kind of allowed me to run with that.
I came in all excited about Macs and electronic publishing and everything.
And they basically said, okay, let's see what you can do with it.

Christine Laperriere:
Even if they had to probably put budget against it, right?

Michael Pilla:
They did.
And there wasn't a lot of budget back then.
I mean, it was more like, what are we going to do with this thing, even if we buy it?
There were higher-end computers involved with publishing.
Most of those had to do with heavy-duty printing, printing plates for printers, and very little of them.
That was the advantage of the Mac, is that it was very, very flexible.
Well, the thing is, a lot of the traditional printers tried to say, oh, we could do that.
But of course, the problem was they had to run film for everything.
The Stone Age of printing.
They're doing film.
They don't do film anymore.
What it meant is if they did film for everything, if you wanted to make a change, you had to go back and rerun film.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Lots of extra steps.

Michael Pilla:
Because it wasn't totally digital.
It was a hybrid of digital and analog.
They tried to sell that, but the Mac, as Zach grew up, he grew up into something that was completely digital, which gave designers all kinds of freedom for good and for ill.

Christine Laperriere:
So this is interesting.
When you were working for these best bosses, just tell me, first of all, did you know you were working for a best boss at the time?

Michael Pilla:
Yeah.
It was two very comfortable relationships.
We actually managed to get close.
There was clearly a hierarchy, but we really had to be friendly after a while.
Go to lunch, go to drinks, that kind of stuff.
We never crossed any lines.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
But still, you build a real working relationship that you value versus just coming in and transactional.

Michael Pilla:
Since the relationship reached a personal level, we were able to work out things out of the office.
So it just made everything a lot easier.

Christine Laperriere:
And then, what do you think the impact is to the business?
So in my world, I do a lot of work with high potential talent and people who are on the track to being managers, leaders, like I said, future best bosses.
And I always get asked, what's the impact to the business?
If you had to guess, what was the impact to the business in these cases where you worked for best bosses?

Michael Pilla:
Personally, the impact of the business was they got a lot out of me.
I mean, I really performed very, very well.
In the case of the book publisher, I made them a lot of money.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So you made them quite a bit more money.

Michael Pilla:
I was able to make a larger impact due to the freedom my bosses gave me.
They got the best out of me, and that helped the company.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, right?
So yeah, you have this kind of entry-level, young, ambitious type.
And they got out of your way enough to let you...

Michael Pilla:
Right.
I mean, I've had subsequent jobs where they would tell me to stop, you know, Mike, you're only a designer.
Why are you bringing up all this other stuff, you know?
And I always saw design with a big D, you know, that it touches and involves a lot of things.
And then people would hire me with design with a little D, which means, you know, we need you to do type corrections.
Just, you know, just do that production work and we'll be happy.
And they try to convince them, no, but there's other things we could be doing, you know, that would make this entire thing work better.

Christine Laperriere:
I like your point about designing with a big D versus a little D, right?
Because I think I see a lot of people believe that their role is to manage detail.
And they do, they miss the broader opportunity.

Michael Pilla:
My first two jobs, I take a bigger picture as possible.
Without even consciously doing it, I mean, I have a very good memory and I have very good hearing.
And I would basically know what everybody was doing, even though it was none of my business.
So more than once, someone would say, you know, what was Charlie working on?
And I'd say, oh, he was doing those things over there.
And they go, why did you know that?
Well, you know, I heard him talking.
And it became like the department, like encyclopedia.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.
So in your career, have you had what I would call less than great bosses?

Michael Pilla:
Not so much a boss, but someone who I worked for and with.
They could be a real handful.
They would start out being very like complimentary.
And we actually did some very, very good creative work together.
But at some point, you know, they would always turn, you know, and they would get very either critical or if there was a problem, they'd throw you under the bus.
Or if they thought you were getting more attention than they were, they would start undercutting you.
I've had a person try to steal business from me.
You know, I would bring them in on a big project.
And the next thing I know, she tries to make it their client and not my client.
And that I'm actually working for them instead of working together.
You know, and this just really, really toxic situation where, and it could be a real mix of being very competent.
I mean, it's manipulative, very complimentary, you know, combined with being very condescending.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and it's interesting because that is, people don't love to be kind of like that feeling of being knocked down or treated as less than, you know what I mean?
Like it's just a human instinct, right?
None of us love to feel like that.

Michael Pilla:
And to go back to, to relate this back to the two bosses, I was saying the two bosses were very supportive if I did well.
They weren't threatened.
In fact, since they were my bosses, they sort of reflected well on them, you know, that they were working with people who were exceeding and excelling.
They never saw it as taking away from their sunshine, as it were.
Another person, if someone else got up, there's one little story.
So I'm talking to another guy who's working with this person and he says, oh, you know, she has this great new assistant, you know, they have this great new assistant, really like working with her.
How long has she been working with this person?
And the guy I'm talking to says she's been there about three weeks.
He's doing a great job.
I said, well, she'll be gone in about two weeks.
He was too many compliments.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.
So out of the gate was always kind of lovely.
But then all of a sudden, when you started to see.

Michael Pilla:
Well, like a lot, I don't know the psychological term for this, but the type of person that could be very charming, very even seductive, very, you know, very nice work with, very productive.
Everything looks just wonderful up to the minute where it's not.
And then all of a sudden, you know, you're a moron.
You can't be trusted.
And if any little thing goes wrong, it's not their fault.
You know, they're more than willing to throw you under the bus.
So it's really abusive after a while.

Christine Laperriere:
Sounds narcissistic.

Michael Pilla:
Totally.
I like that.
It's toxic narcissism.
Yep.
Absolutely.
Totally abusive, totally narcissistic.
And it's something to really watch out for, because you just waste a lot of time with people like.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Well, and you know, I, a lot of the times in coaching conversations, you know, it's important to remind people like they have choice of who they want to work for, you know, like we're not prisoners.

Michael Pilla:
Right.
Right.
Yes.
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And I think that will help.
Like the more people do leave when they don't work for great leaders, the faster we start to correct some of that problem, you know, but as soon as we convince people that they're in a box and they have to tolerate it, it's hard to get people to believe.

Michael Pilla:
It gets worse.
And it's like, once those people know you're in a box, they just really dump all over you.
You know, it's just like, you know, it's like you're like, you're in a trap.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a tough one because I see that a lot.
And there's something in high performing people, there's a small segment that some of that narcissism works because they're very competitive and they excel.
They know how to work a room and all of that.
But the problem is, is once they become leaders, they become very toxic.
So quick question.
If you had to, you know, teach or advise leaders on how to be a best boss, given everything you've seen in your experience, what would you tell them to focus on?
What would you tell them to do and be explicit?
Give them, you know, practices.
What would they do?

Michael Pilla:
I mean, it starts with respecting the people we work with and insist that they respect you.
You know, there's the thing in the military where, you know, your subordinates owe you obedience, but you owe them care.
You're leading guys at the battle.
Yeah, they're supposed to follow you, but it's up to you to make sure that you're not putting them in harm's way.
You know what I mean?
So that's the two-way ladder of leadership in that situation.
So yeah, you want to, first of all, total respect on everybody's level.
I think it's important to encourage that, to get the best out of the people you're working with, not to be overly critical.
And if things do go wrong, use those as teaching situations.
Give people leeway to be themselves.
You know, you may have the best idea, but maybe somebody has something better.
I would also say be very clear and decisive.
I've worked for people who like to make a consensus.
I do invite, you know, people's opinions.
I do invite, you know, alternate ways of doing things, but it's all about the understanding is that I'm the guy in charge and it's my decision.
It's my client, it's my job, it's my clients, my department, it's my, you know, behind.
So we're going to go my, I welcome all your input because that does affect my decision, but the final decision has to be mine.
And I think that that makes things a lot clearer.
And when you do make a decision, make it clear.
And on the other side of that, if it's clear after a while that that decision is not working, make another one.
Don't dig a hole for yourself, you know.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't double down on a bad decision.

Michael Pilla:
And also the general is just treat people as people.
You know, I always try to get to know the people who are working for me a little bit, you know, just on a slight personal level.
So I get a sense of, I mean, I find that helps with just general communication.
You know, if I really, if I know people better, I can read them better.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
I've always believed that.

Michael Pilla:
Tell what they're talking about, what they're having issues if, you know, just how things are going that way.
But it has to do basically with treating people as people, you know, give them leeway, take responsibility and be in charge, you know.

Christine Laperriere:
Great.
Well, listen, I think that's a fantastic thinking for everybody out there today.
Anything else you want to add?

Michael Pilla:
Well, this is an aside.
Part of leadership, especially in a business situation, is managing your clients.
People don't see that as part of leadership because, you know, you've got to deal with, you're taking orders and you have to use those orders not only to get the job done, but to also, you know, take care of your team.
And I became very good at dealing with clients when I became a parent.
And it was one day I'm leaving home.
I have a three-year-old daughter who's just, I don't know where she is.
She's inconsolable, but she's just noise.
So I get myself to the office and I'm dealing with a client who's exactly the same way.
He's screaming all over the place.
So I was just like dealing with the baby.
Same technique.
I went, that's okay.
Tell me, tell me what the problem is.
Instead of, you know, running around and apologizing and what can we do?
And I just, just calm down a minute.
You know, tell me, try to tell me what's wrong.
Let's, let's focus on, you know, what the issue.
And more times than not, it's a small issue that just got blown out of proportion.
Right, right, right.
How do you get them to focus on the one thing?
And a lot of times instead of the stupidest, I really hate green.
Okay, let's remove the green.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
This is solvable.

Michael Pilla:
This is solvable.

Christine Laperriere:
That's funny.
I have young kids and I find that there's days where you just start to realize that adults are just bigger young kids.

Michael Pilla:
It was really funny because I finished dealing with my daughter and I was using the exact same approach on the client.
It was sort of an eye-opener.
The other eye-opener was, are you familiar with the dog whisperer?

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, Caesar Milan.

Michael Pilla:
Yeah, now that works too.
Okay, dogs are pack animals.
So a pack animal will instinctively look for a leader.
Now, if there is no leader, the pack animal decides they are the leader.
That's why little dogs are hard to control.
There's people, people give them a lot of leeway and so the dog thinks it's a leader.
So the dog thinks it's running the house.
So you have to be very calm but assertive and get the dog into a place where it is sort of passive.

Christine Laperriere:
It knows that there is a leader in the house.

Michael Pilla:
And it makes them comfortable because they know what the story is.
So I had this one boss who was literally a bulldog and again another yeller and I refused to give into the yelling and I just related to him in a very much, you know, calm and assertive way.
I answered his questions very quietly and it triggered something because he calmed down and he was fine.
As I got to a point, we get to the end of the conversation and he goes, so he says, is this environmentally safe?
Because there was part of their thing with this building they were doing a whole environmental thing.
I go, Alan?
I said, this is printed on recycled paper with soy ink.
I said, you'll be able to eat this thing when we're finished.
You know, so he went, yeah, okay.
But he never gave me any trouble because I always approached him like without fear, without trepidation, without fear and just one-to-one.
I mean, you know, look him in the eye and say what I had to say and it literally triggers something in the human mind.
They go somewhere else.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a good reminder, you know, I'm smiling and loving this conversation about, you know, the tie into parenting and dog whispering because, you know, I completely agree that humans are pack animals, right?

Michael Pilla:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
We do.
Exactly.
We look for a leader.
We are looking and I'm thinking about it just while you're talking and thinking about different places that I coach and support and work alongside.
You know, you mentioned the point of consensus, right?
And when somebody looks like they're not going to take a leadership stance, you end up with a lot of people getting confused and rallying for leadership.
It's just such an interesting, you know, and I love the dog whisper correlation.

Michael Pilla:
Right.
No, it becomes like a mess because everybody's going to have their two cents and the issue becomes more about people having their two cents than about getting something done.
You're reminded with a mishmash, which may or may not work, but that really wasn't the point.
Everybody had to feel good.
I mean, there's a lot of ways to feel good.
You know, you can feel good that you got your point in, but you could just feel good that you were part of a team that accomplished something regardless of what your contribution was.
So there's that.
But yes, actually, dogs, I did some studies of this after a while, but the psychology of dogs and humans are very, very close.
Sociologists are wondering if the relationship between men and dogs, it isn't simply that men started or women or whoever, people started feeding dogs.
That there was already like a common thought process, you know, which in primitive times led to the hunt.
They both hunted in similar ways.
They hunted in packs.
You don't mind me going on here, but then apparently in prehistoric time stuff, they would hunt together.
They'd be hunting the same animal.
And they got to the point where they would start cooperating.
And out of that led the domestication of dogs.
So it wasn't that they were hanging around people to get a free meal.
There was some sort of a sympathetic connection between the way they thought and the way they reacted to each other.

Christine Laperriere:
That's interesting.
Like I said, be on my mind today as I go forward.
I'll be thinking about that because I agree.
And I've always said that there is something, you know, in that pack leadership piece that I noticed that's very hard to describe sometimes when I'm working with a group, but I can feel it.
I can feel the who's the boss confusion.
And what ends up happening is people instinctively, even really good people who don't have any negative intent, will start to rally for some territory or something that they can dominate because they're confused.

Michael Pilla:
Yeah.
That's when it gets out of control.
Yeah.
No, we're not talking about somebody standing on the desk, yelling, I'm in charge, but just somebody who can, you know, logically guide the group to where it needs to be.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Because if there isn't that perceived guidance, it gets confusing for people.
You see the infighting start to pick up, right?

Michael Pilla:
The two things Cesar Millan says is basically you need to be calm and assertive.
The leader is calm and assertive that that will trickle through the group.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
Well, listen, Michael, this was a lot of fun.
And I think- 

Michael Pilla:
Yes, same here.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the kind of corners of this conversation and where they went.
This is fun for me.

Title: Making sales management look easy
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Mark Cox

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I've invited Mark Cox onto the show, and we are going to have a really cool conversation about his experience of his best boss, but also a bit about all the great selling work and sales training experience he does in his current business.
Welcome, Mark.

Mark Cox:
Oh, thanks, Christine.
I was so excited to join you today.
I love this topic.
It's such a smart idea for a podcast.

Christine Laperriere:
And just so everybody knows, where can they find you?
Yeah, thank you.
We're at InTheFunnel.com.
So I founded a company called InTheFunnel.com.
We help companies sell better.
And I'm all over LinkedIn too.
It's Mark Cox, M-A-R-K-C-O-X on LinkedIn.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And it's neat because Mark and I actually met through doing some sales transformation work together.
We did a long time ago.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.
So this is why it's really fun to reconnect with this leadership topic.
So I'm going to go ahead and dive in.
Tell us, best boss, who was it?

Mark Cox:
Well, you know what?
I may not share a name because, Christine, I'm sure you've had so many guests on the show, right?
Where you've had so many great bosses.
Like you were so privileged.
You had all of these great bosses.
Maybe a couple that weren't awesome either.
But maybe just to protect the innocent, I won't share a name because I'm going to share some of the attributes and some of the stories, but I feel like I'd be picking a favorite child.
It feels like it's Sophie's choice or something.
But I definitely have somebody in mind that really had a huge impact on me at a really kind of pivotal stage of my career.
Like I'm going to want to say I was probably my second or third job in, professional job in.
And it's just when things were starting to come together from a sales perspective.
So it was a really important move for me to join the company.
And the main reason, of course, I joined the company was because of this boss.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
So you actually, you joined the company because this person was who you wanted to work for.

Mark Cox:
Yeah, I kind of grew up in the earliest days of technology, selling photocopiers.
And there were a couple of companies that did that.
And that evolved into something called outsourcing or facilities management is a big thing, kind of the mid 90s.
And there were a couple of people who were real players in that space.
I got exposure to competitors and people who ran those competitors, sales organizations and ultimately had an opportunity to work with one when they were part of a startup.
So I knew this person and I had competed against them.
I'd actually lost, but it was one of those ones where you had this, I had some interaction.
And for where I was sitting, he pretty much had, he was sort of the penultimate sales leader and sales person and all of those kinds of things.
He looked like he was really good at almost everything he did to me.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
Wow.
Cool.
And so when you went to go work with him, can you tell me a little bit about what was it like to work with this person who you obviously looked up to from afar?

Mark Cox:
First of all, it was great.
It was challenging and it was great.
I think I'd been up to that point in my career, been in a couple of organizations where I felt I probably knew as much or more than most of the people running the sales organizations and so forth.
And this was the first time I came across somebody and I thought, boy, there's a lot to learn from this person.
And so I really liked that.
They were very strategic and they granted a lot of autonomy, but they just seemed so intentional, so smart about everything they did.
And one of the things that I loved about this fellow was I would spend a lot of time strategizing on accounts.
And you know, back in those days, you did things like Miller Heiman.
You'll remember that one.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, definitely.

Mark Cox:
By the way, for those listening by strategic selling today, it's still 60% of every sales book out there is Miller Hyman strategic selling.

Christine Laperriere:
Exactly.

Mark Cox:
But so it was a good framework and I had a framework and a methodical.
So I'd work through deals.
We were working.
The deals were significant.
And I remember every time I went in for a one-on-one, this fellow had the ability to ask a question that I'd never heard before and maybe didn't have a great answer to.
There wasn't a lot of and it was always from the client perspective, but it has these great questions.
The obvious ones, you know, why is this project such a priority for the client?
You know, what exactly is the return on investment for the client?
How many years does it take to pay this thing back?
Given everything else they're doing, why does this make the top 10?
And it was with these kinds of questions where he knew the answer, but didn't give it to me.
He would let me kind of try and think through the answer.
And all I kept thinking was I'd keep that office going next time.
I'm going to be so prepared.
There's no question he can ask.
I don't have the answer to, and then he'd do it again.
And it was all part of this learning where over the few years I was working for him, my ability to think through strategically a deal really elevated.
And so, by the way, that feels really good at times.
It feels a little bad at times.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Mark Cox:
Sometimes you don't know the answer.
You don't know the answer, and you want to look good.
And if you're impressed by the boss, you definitely want to look good.
So that was one of the things that really struck me was the one-on-ones, they'd be so intentional.
I could tell he'd done it a lot, so he's very good at it.
But he was pretty intentional about the way he asked questions and the way he led me through one-on-one.
I was doing all the work in the one-on-one, but it was only because he was running it so well.

Christine Laperriere:
See, and this is really at the end of the day, wouldn't you say this is the origin of great sales coaching?

Mark Cox:
100% is absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
We're trying to inspire leaders to be thoughtful, especially sales coaches.
And I think a lot of leaders think that sales coaching is following up on your numbers.
What's your pipeline?
What's your revenue?
Why aren't you getting your revenue numbers met?
And then sometimes jumping to solutions, right?
So lots of sales leaders say, this is what you should do.
This is what you should do.

Mark Cox:
Michael Bungay, I always get his name wrong, but the coaching haven't.
For those people out there, one of the best reads out there, so simple, but so hard.
When we're as sales leaders today, we're all in the same boat every quarter.
We're hearing that cadence.
We're sitting down for a one-on-ones, and we're really tracking the top deals that are going to get us to our number.
So it's just opportunity management as all sales management tends to be, to have someone back in those days, be very strategic.
And I could tell I was getting better.
Christine, that was one of the things that was also so important to me.
I could feel like I felt like I was getting better, and I was a little outside my comfort zone, and I was learning.
And as we all know, like you never get tired of learning.
I think I think you start to get tired of doing the same thing when you become masterful at it, and it's not evolving.
But if you're learning, it sort of keeps you sharp and keeps you engaged.
And I wasn't the only one who found this person to be a great coach and a great leader.
There were two or three sales people in this company, and frankly, they've all gone on to amazing things, like because this was sort of a startup.
But the other two people have gone on to amazing things, but we'd be just pounding it out late at night and loving it.
And I thought to myself, this guy's really got this team coming.
Like he's got great salespeople, and he's getting the most out of them.
It's a real powerful thing.

Christine Laperriere:
So he's asking these great questions in your one-on-ones.
He's really challenging your thinking.
You feel like you're getting better as a sales professional while you're working with him.
So what else was he doing that really brought the team together, though?
You mentioned that, and that's a little bit different than individual performance.
Now you're seeing the whole team operate.
What did he do to create that kind of glue?

Mark Cox:
I think all of us wanted to become him.
He actually made one of those people who made sales management look attractive because he was so good at it.
He almost made it look easy.
And as you and I both know, and I'll tell you about my worst boss ever, it's not easy.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.

Mark Cox:
It's not easy.
So he really had us motivated because I think all of us wanted to replace him.
I think most of us could have been candidates for that.
And the other thing, it was a while back now, Christine, but one of the things I do know is he took those opportunities to make it about me, not about him.
And it wasn't hard for him to assess somebody like me was ambitious.
So I think it was quite intentional about talking about career progression and next steps and the opportunity and all those kinds of good things because he was this role model on a couple of different fronts where I might have looked at it being 10 years as junior and said most of those things look pretty good to me, the way this guy's got it all sorted out.
So I think he spent enough time thinking about that.
The other thing I think, given what I've done since there and some exposure, he actually was a nice person.
And when you get to your stage, your career, my stage in my career, there's a no jerks policy in life now.
There's talented people out there that are jerks.
They can't come anywhere near in the funnel and we won't work for them either.
Right.
So based on the way I'm built, I'm not looking for my boss to be my friend or best friend, but I actually have to have respect that he's a good person or she's a good person.
And for the most part, I've been really blessed in my career having lots of boss and they were all good people.
And if they weren't, by the way, I just walked out the door, which I've done too.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, absolutely.
And the meat of that, what's so interesting is, again, I actually was working with a sales leader one day and he said something about I never buy from people I don't trust.
And ironically, people I trust, I like.
And so he kind of, you know, he was like, I don't need to like you necessarily to buy from you.
But there's just this interesting correlation to the fact that I need to trust you.
And ironically, I always like people that I trust.
And I was like, that makes a ton of sense, actually.

Mark Cox:
It does.
And I can't if the book is called Can You Hear Me?
I forget the name of the professor who wrote it.
But one of the things he said was when we first meet somebody, the first thing we're trying to assess consciously and subconsciously is their intent.
What's their intent?
And so so I think somehow, you know, the old adage, which still rings true, which is, you know, they care what you know, only if they know that you care.
Oh, is that cool?
I don't again, these adages, who knows where I heard this?
I've stolen all of this from other people.
So credit to anybody who said these things.
But I think it really is that that thing is so important today, which is, it will all be held accountable.
You know, we all understand we've got to perform.
There's that reality.
But I do want to be working with folks who have the right intent for me.
And I want to make sure I have the right intent for people I'm working working with and that they know it.

Christine Laperriere:
That's really good.
I love that quote.
That's amazing.
So now when we got on the line, and I just started to dribble this idea of the worst boss ever, you kind of had a different angle on it when when I asked you that question.
So tell us a little bit about how that one popped for you.

Mark Cox:
Yeah, what popped for me was I was absolutely one of the worst sales managers ever when I first started.
And as as fate would have, it was very soon after being exposed to this individual, where I've seen what is perfect look like.
But there's no question when I first became a sales manager, maybe 20 years ago, it was amazing how quickly I became miserable.
And the seven or eight people who reported to me became miserable.
Okay, there were just such great lessons from it that I think we're sharing.
First of all, I was pretty good at selling for this particular company exactly what these people were selling.
So I was a top player on the team.
And then I got promoted.
And so as soon as I got promoted, it seems so logical to me that everybody should do exactly what I had just been doing exactly the way I had been doing it.
Oh, good.
Seems seems so evident.
Right, right.
I was doing great skill selling.
Do it exactly do exactly exactly the way I do it.
And we know how that story ends where, you know, I'm diminishing their unique abilities and what they're good at.
They feel like they're being told what to do all the time because I did tell them what to do all the time.
They don't feel like they're getting credit for anything.
I think a lot of I probably showed that I was in over my head when I was managing the teams to begin with.
So it felt like it was all about me.
And maybe there was a lot of judgment coming from me to these other people, because I'd just been working side by each with them.
So I knew what they've been up to and whether they've been good or bad.
So all of these things like intent, it was all in the wrong place.
And it was so interesting.
Christine, the story is so funny because I'm miserable, literally to the point of thinking about leaving.
They're miserable, probably thinking about leaving.
But in huge companies, funny decisions get made.
So I end up getting promoted.
Are you kidding?
No.

Christine Laperriere:
And so you're going to really bump some people out there.
Oh, my God.
Looking for a lousy boss right now.

Mark Cox:
And wow.
So then I get promoted.
But it has a happier ending.
I then get promoted to run an area of the business I had no exposure to whatsoever.
So now I'm running a smaller team of people in a different, completely different line of business that I had no background or understanding of.
So now when I'm managing this team and they're coming in saying, here's my situation.
Here's what I'm up to.
Here's the three things I could do.
What do you think I should do, Mark?
I had no other answer except, what do you think you should do?
Because I have five years experience of having done it all the time.
So I started to be able to step away from it to get out of the weeds and start to think about not trying to be the subject matter expert, but trying to be a better coach or a better leader.
And it was kind of interesting that after these one on ones that I would have with people compared to the previous role I'd just been in, I wasn't looking forward to any of the one on ones.
Every time I have these new ones or these meetings with people on my team, I enjoyed all of them.
I was really curious as to what's going on.
I really wanted them to kind of come to the table with some options and alternatives.
I was authentically working through solutions with them in real time, but mostly putting it on them to come to the answer.
And so they enjoyed them more.
I enjoyed them more and you know how this story ends.
It was just great.

Christine Laperriere:
You actually had success in that environment, not feeling like you're trying to micromanage everything and people are feeling their autonomy swept out from under them.

Mark Cox:
Completely.
So by way of this podcast, I think I need to apologize to everybody who's managing in that first group.
They've all gone on to greater things too, by the way.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm sure it was not fun for them to see you get promoted again.

Mark Cox:
Right.
It wasn't.
And we've stayed in, they were all great people and we've stayed in touch since then.
They've done great things.
I think it's a bit of a lesson also for all of those becoming the boss the first time.
This fellow made that job look so darn easy, but it does take a lot of time and effort and intention to become that boss who is a great boss.
It's hard.

Christine Laperriere:
It is.
And I think, you know, it's interesting because I focus on leaders that are kind of midway through their career.
So I don't go after the C-suite and I don't go after entry level, but I really, you know, all the work I do is really high potential talent that's kind of sitting in that manager, director, vice president level.
And I really think there's this maturity that happens through that, you know, it's a cocoon to butterfly maturity.
And to your point, you know, it's kind of like a lot of things.
It looks easy as you're watching, you know, when you're doing the, what do they call it?
The Monday night armchair.

Mark Cox:
Armchair quarterback.

Christine Laperriere:
Armchair quarterback.
There you go.
And so it's like, oh, well, you know, just do it this way.
Just throw the ball here.
And then all of a sudden, when you're thrown out in the field, you realize that there's a million reasons why you don't make the decision that everybody else thinks is intuitive.
And so I really like the fact that, you know, you identified yourself as a worst boss because it's the self awareness to realize that it it's actually a lot harder than it looks that probably gave you the opportunity for the maturity to happen.

Mark Cox:
Well, you know, you're absolutely right, Christine.
And I think the other thing it's hard for all of us when we're being managed by a bad boss, we have a tough time having any empathy for what they're going through because this is the other side of the coin.
We have a boss going through a tough time, but as a direct contributor being managed, I make it all the time about me instead of thinking through what are they going through as a new boss or what pressures do they have?
What challenges do they have that they're insulating me from as a direct contributor?
It's I think people become good at managing people over time.
It's not an overnight thing and it takes a lot of time, but I think one of the things they get is they get a little bit of a confidence around their judgment and their approach.
And once they've got that confidence, they become a better boss because they can actually respond instead of react and they can coach instead of inspect.
And so they can question instead of tell.
And I think the bad side of each of those coins comes when you're kind of new, often times to doing this, you're just not as comfortable in your role.
And this is a big problem, by the way, in professional sales today, because, you know, recent Gardner research says if you're a CRO or running a sales organization at a high level, your tenure is 18 months, 18 months.
The first six are going to be, you know, three to six, you're caught up to going, hey, what is this business?
What's going on in my team?
What's the strategy?
Now I got 12 months when I'm reporting to the executive team or reporting to the board or I'm out.
So you don't have that.
You just don't have that leeway.
And I'm now I'm reacting all the time.

Christine Laperriere:
No, I was just talking to somebody taking on that chief sales officer role.
You know, I was saying to her exactly that I said, like, these are very short runways like you don't.
You're going to be shocked at how little time you have to prove your impact on the sales organization.
Like we're going to have this is go time.

Mark Cox:
Total go time.
It's go time yet.
On the one side, we're saying go time and I've got to respond to a board or an executive team.
I'm dealing with clients, so they're going to take all my time as a new CRO.
I've got to get in front of lots of clients to understand what's going on there and put them first.
And then I've got a sales team that's watching every single thing I do.
And they're magnifying every action I make in the first 90 days.
They're trying to figure out who is he and what's he all about and what's his value system and how do I position myself and so on and so on and so forth.
It's actually one of the hardest jobs on the executive team in my view these days.
So given all of those things, what falls off the radar first?
Coaching.

Christine Laperriere:
You're exactly right.
Well, it's interesting when you say, you know, to me, coaching is something when you're in highly reactive mode, your intuition doesn't say coach.
It says direct.
I don't know about you, but that's how I feel when I'm under pressure.
I direct and control.
And when I'm more relaxed, I can coach.
So I can see why coaching is the first thing to go, especially in, like I said, those sales roles are, you know, you need to prove yourself pretty, pretty quick.
So you'd have the sense of urgency that you need to be reactive.

Mark Cox:
Well, you know, you're so right.
But as the leader, Christine, what do you like most doing?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely coaching all the way.

Mark Cox:
If you like coaching as I do and, you know, there really is this joy of seeing people develop, you know, exceed expectations and reach their potential and then maybe replace you.
There is a joy to that.
I think I think as leaders, our best bet these days is we do have to turn off the noise and just do what we know is the right thing to do.
Because if you react instead of respond and do all these other things and start, you know, dancing upside down and, you know, it's the functional equivalent of playing a sport without warming up.
Bad things are going to happen anyway.
So why not just do what you think you should do and your pal, your friend who went into that new role, this is exactly the conversation that she needs with the executive team before she takes the role.
I'm going to take this thing over.
It's going to get worse before it gets better.
So let's say it's a couple of quarters to ramp up.
Then there's going to be a dip in a quarter.
Then your systems processes, methodology, strategies, cadence, all those things are going to come into play after that.
But now we're into a year, year and a half before we start seeing things move in the right direction.
I think setting those kinds of expectations with her boss now, it's really important and get them in writing because then I can get in.
I'm not feeling that cadence 90 days in.
I don't feel like the bell's ringing.
And then that calmness or that approach, that leadership passes down to the team so they can calm down and they know, okay, we've got to do the right things here and it's going to take some time.
We'll set new expectations.
We'll train the team, then hold them accountable, but not in 30 days.
And then suddenly I think, you know, you start to see this, some cool things happen in terms of sales culture being a place that everybody wants to be a part of.
But it's really hard and it's hardest for the boss.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
So you can see how many people start in that worst boss camp before they actually get a chance to achieve any kind of monumental improvement in that leadership role.
So I love that.
That's very useful.

Mark Cox:
So just as I'm thinking, you know, kind of tying this up, knowing that that leadership role is so important.
And again, you would really know through the lens of sales organizations, given your experience.
I always get asked what's the return on investment of building best bosses, right?
Can you help me understand what is the financial or numeric benefit of working for a best boss?

Mark Cox:
Man, the leverage for best bosses is leverage.
If I have a great sales leader, then that person, she's going to make the team of eight salespeople better across the board.
So it's just pure leverage.
So I'm going to get that whole team to be better.
And by better, I mean they perform at a higher level, they're engaged, they're learning, they're dynamic, as a result of which they make for a better business culture.
It just has this ripple or domino effect the whole way down.
The opposite is also true.
So the worst boss at that executive team level also has a domino effect on their eight to 10 direct reports, those and so on and so forth.
Now those people are unpleasant to deal with within the organization.
They stay within their job descriptions.
They're not really engaged with the company.
They don't want the company to do well.
And so it becomes this other thing, the spiral of doom.

Christine Laperriere:
So they multiply that kind of toxicity across eight people, right?

Mark Cox:
They do.
Liz Wiseman multipliers.
That's the return on investment.
You know, you either have somebody who's diminishing the capabilities of everybody on the team or they're multiplying them and it just becomes exponential.
That's what I really think it is.
If I'm looking for a CEO today, if I am the CEO, I'm looking for teammates who are those best bosses and the domino effects, the positive domino effects on performance, culture, retention, engagement, all of those things, client satisfaction.
I think there's an absolutely direct correlation to all that stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
All right.
Any words of wisdom as we're just wrapping up all those leaders out there that are trying to learn how to keep raising the bar for themselves?
Any final thoughts for them?

Mark Cox:
Final thoughts, I would say, listen to this podcast.
This is, I was so excited to join today, Christine.
It's such a smart idea.
How do you get better at managing people and leading people?

Christine Laperriere:
Great.
Thank you so much, Mark.

Mark Cox:
Thank you for hosting me.
It's been a real pleasure being on this, Christine.

Title: The gift of feedback
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Tonya Campbell

Christine Laperriere:
I have invited Tanya Campbell back from Scotiabank to have another chat with me.
If you didn't see, she was on the first season.
You can look up Tanya Campbell's show, but we had such a great conversation that we just decided we needed to do another one.
So today we're going to take a little different angle.
And the way we're going to approach this conversation is really about what are you doing to be a best boss?
Now, we all know that just like parenting or spousing or any of those things, it's hard to quote unquote be the best.
But what I think is special about Tanya is I know that she pursues trying to be a best boss.
So we're going to ask her about what she's doing in that pursuit.
And we're also going to learn about what are some of the challenges she faces while she's working through that.
So welcome on the show, Tanya.

Tonya Campbell:
Thank you for having me back, Christine.
I'm really excited about our conversation today.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
So just to set everybody clear, give us your title really quick again at Scotiabank.

Tonya Campbell:
I am the vice president for our mobile advice team, which is a financial planning team who does not work in a fixed office.
They are mobile.
Not to be confused with a mobile home.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
And so just in spirit of where we're going today, what are some of the things you are doing in the pursuit to be a best boss?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, we talked last time a lot about what, you know, I have always seen or felt as a best boss, which was really founded on trust.
And so for me, I start there.
So I will always look to make sure that I am building trust with people and that my team knows that whatever I'm doing, it's in the best interest of, you know, for both of us as an employee, employer, the customer, what have you.
And so for me, it's really starting with the foundation of trust.
But I would just go one step further and say, like, OK, that's, you know, inherently there.
I think I do a pretty good job with the people I've worked with.
But where I really feel like I'm zeroing in now to take that to another level is in feedback, because I think that feedback is just such an incredible gift.
And when I really think about the bosses that I've talked about in the past, it wasn't just the trust.
When I think really deeply, it was that there was conversations and feedback that I could build off of, and that made me a better person.
And so that's what I'm trying to emulate in my world now is making sure that when I talk to people, my employees and colleagues, that I'm very curious, ask a lot of questions, but with the intent that I can give them feedback that will take their work just to the next level.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that you're picking feedback as a topic.
I know I see so many leaders that struggle with giving honest feedback.
And so a lot of the times I'm talking to leaders about what I nickname the broccoli between your teeth feedback, the feedback where, you know, if you went, how come you didn't tell me, you know, six months I walked around with this broccoli between my teeth, like, how come you didn't tell me?
What is it like for you, first of all, when you're trying to give tough feedback, tell me what, you know, how do you do that if you had to teach me?

Tonya Campbell:
Oh, goodness.
Yeah.
So when I'm doing feedback, first and foremost, I try to do it as soon as possible.
I don't like to wait.
I think it diminishes the quality of the feedback.
If you wait too long, you know, we have, you know, touch bases with our people, you know, scheduled weekly or biweekly.
And, you know, do you really wait five, seven, ten, twelve, fourteen days to give that?
So I usually try to give it as soon as possible.
And it usually just starts with like, hey, do you have two minutes to chat about that, that thing, that presentation or whatever, you know, whatever it is that I observed.
So I do try to just kind of jump in because it feels for me.
And I think for the recipient, it feels really natural when you do it right there and then.

Christine Laperriere:
So give us some examples and some stories about what you're seeing right now as you're trying to kind of live into this value of giving feedback.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah.
So I think for me, there is sort of different groups of people.
I could bucket them into, you know, people that I've worked with for a while and they know my style and it's really easy and they've got it and what have you.
And those ones seem to be really easy.
They know me, they trust me.
We can kind of pull that apart.
I think when you're developing new relationships with new employees and also generational differences, it gets more challenging.
To be quite honest with you, there's, you know, the I struggle in this space because I think generationally, if I'm talking to people and, you know, plus or minus, 10 years of me, it works a lot better.
But for some reason, it's not landing quite as well with some in the generational differences.
And I don't know how to crack that nut.
I'm not perfect.
I'm trying to figure that out.
And I don't know if it's just how we communicate differently these days, you know, the difference between long discussions over a phone versus text messages, etc.
And I'm working on it.

Christine Laperriere:
I know I work with a lot of leaders where sometimes the the younger generations, there there's just a difference in the way that we've been raised or the way we see work and the way we perceive even the use of technology at work and conversation.
And so lots of us are trying to figure out how do we, again, bridge that gap so that we can be inclusive of our entire workforce?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, it's even, you know, I laugh because it's even the language, right?
So my generation was kind of like, you know, the smack on the head be tough.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Tonya Campbell:
My generation may be able to take feedback a little more openly because it's probably even to into the pendulum swinging.
And maybe the language is a little softer than what we're used to.
But, you know, I grew up in an environment where it was kind of like you take one on the shoulder, take the feedback and go.
And it was not a big deal.
And so now I find myself worrying about the language that I use.
And is it too hard or too harsh?
Is it are they going to handle it well?
And it's a bit of a pendulum swing.
So I've had some I've had a situation that I can think of not too long ago where I, you know, somebody was asking, they actually asked for feedback.
And so having been sort of burnt by a previous conversation or feedback session for this one, I tried to correct.
And I said, how do you like to receive your feedback?
Like, are you OK with shoot straight from the hip?
I'm kind of like a very direct person.
Or do you, you know, do you want to have a bit of a sandwich approach?
Like you did this really well, you could do this better.
But oh, by the way, you know, landed this one awesome.
And so it's kind of sandwiched between some awesome stuff.
And the person was like, no, no, no, just give it to me.
Like, just tell me straight.
I like the shoot from the hip.
But then I gave him the shoot from the hip.
And, you know, it was a catastrophe, right?
The person really ended up in near tears.
So, you know, I'm trying to figure it out by asking those types of questions.
And then even when I think back on the feedback that I gave in that situation, like it really wasn't in my view, it really, even though I was shooting straight from the hip, it still wasn't harsh.
It wasn't mean.
I mean, it was very, the spirit of the feedback was genuine with, you know, wanting that person to correct a certain something that I saw.
So, yeah, it's been a challenge for me to figure out this sort of delicate balance.

Christine Laperriere:
One thing I'll mention while you're talking, I think that's really interesting in doing over 50 interviews now on The Best Boss Ever.
What I have found over and over again is that people, they never say their best boss ever was because they were nice.
The one thing that I see in the reoccurring theme is that actually getting tough feedback from somebody actually ranks them as a best boss.
And I'll just say even, you know, while you were talking about that, you know, obviously you impacted that person and made them feel pretty lousy in the moment because they got that tough feedback.
But the thing that's interesting is that when I think of all the interviews I've done, first of all, the best boss that gave the tough feedback was always coming from a place of genuinely wanting to see that person grow.
So they it was never of an ego thing.
It was really not about the business.
It was about that person's growth.
And that was the reason they gave the harsh feedback.
And the second thing is, is that I don't know when I think about it, I don't know if everybody handled it well exactly in the moment.
I can think of my own experiences of getting tough feedback, and I probably wasn't smiling and saying, oh, thank you, you're my best boss.
I probably was like, ouch, that hurt.
But I think upon reflection, like the growth that comes from a piece of feedback that is that harsh is powerful.
And in retrospect, you you thank that leader.
But in the moment, you might not.
It's just a reflection I had while you were talking.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah.
Well, I hope it's the case in this scenario that I'm talking about.
I hope that somewhere along the line, I just worry and maybe not not rightfully so.
But I worry that people aren't seeing the gift that's being given, whether and, you know, certainly I'll work on my harshness or how I deliver.
But it's always in the spirit of giving somebody a gift, because if I didn't care about them, I would give them zero feedback.
So for me, it's yes, I'll work on my delivery, but I still worry that people aren't seeing the gift that it is.

Christine Laperriere:
But I think if it's wrapped in too much, too much ribbon, you know, it doesn't land right.
I mean, I can think of a time when I was facilitating a session and I had a coach in a room and I got done with the session.
And she came up to me and said, you know, your content, you are fantastic in content, but you use self deprecating humor to a fault, to the point where it's annoying.
And I was like, oh, oh, oh, like, I remember it felt like a gut punch.
But she said it so clearly and she said, you have to stop making fun of yourself in front of the room.
You're you're actually crushing your own credibility.
And because she was so crystal clear on what the message was, I really took it home.
I didn't smile at the moment and go, thank you.
You're you're my best boss.
But I've actually publicly thanked her on LinkedIn years later because I think it was a game changer moment.
I think she actually if nobody had told me that that broccoli between my teeth and I had walked around with that for two or three years doing that, I would have never made it as far as I did.
I think she actually helped me really advance things quickly because I had a pretty massive fault that would slow my progress down.
So I think of that example and I go, you know, what if we started to talk about it as, you know, it might not feel good at the moment, that actually means that you might deliver something that could really progress somebody's performance.

Tonya Campbell:
I love that.
I think I think if there's listeners hearing us today, I think this goes both ways.
Right.
The being a receiver of feedback is it's really important to listen to this.
But also maybe I'm worried about how I'm delivering feedback, but also as a receiver, I might need to think if I put myself in the shoes of that person, they told me that they could take it straight from the hip.
Right.
But maybe as a as a receiver, I need to think about what kind of what kind of a receiver am I as feedback?
Do I need the gentle and maybe do a little bit of a check in and go like, am I able to take it?
Because if not, maybe I need to, you know, make some adjustments on my.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
It's interesting because it takes time to process real tough feedback.
But the gift of it comes once you really get a chance.
You know, oh, God, thank God I didn't do that.
Or, you know, if somebody has poor presentation skills and it's damaging their executive level relationships, if you can give that to them and they sure they're going to say, oh, I can handle it.
I know I was thinking that right before I got that piece of feedback.
I was like, I can handle anything.
Go for it.
Anything you got for me.
I, you know, I really want to know.
And then I heard that and went, oh, I just remember processing.
It took a couple of days to process that feeling kind of embarrassed that that I had been doing something so obviously wrong.
But on the flip side, you know, then coming around to.
Thank God somebody told me, thank God somebody had the courage to tell me and didn't worry about my feelings in the moment.
And they were more worried about my performance in the long run.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah.
Well, I mean, they've literally instantly unlocked something for you.
Right.
That would have been, you know, a potential barrier.
So that unlocking is is important.
But, you know, I think that's it.
I think when I think about feedback, those are the things I struggle with is, how do I do it in a way?
Maybe I'll care less now going forward, because I'll be like, yeah, they'll wake up and they'll be grateful.

Christine Laperriere:
I'll get a thank you card later.

Tonya Campbell:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, I heard a really good metaphor used around conflict recently, and I think of it similar to feedback, but they were talking about conflict and making conflict more like flossing and less like a root canal.
And it's become one of my favorite metaphors lately.
More like flossing and less like a root canal.
So I think of feedback and just what you're saying about feedback.
What if we were delivered feedback on a more regular basis?
And so these broccoli between our teeth conversations are more like flossing and less like a root canal.

Tonya Campbell:
Flossing instead of a root canal.
I'll have to tell my team that one when I get back to the office.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is where that regular, just like you said, giving real time feedback and giving it frequently is really the inspiration of flossing.
Right.
It's that idea of saying, I'm going to talk about these things in small bite sized pieces on a regular basis instead of waiting till the year end and delivering the root canal.

Tonya Campbell:
Right.
But even better is if I use that analogy now with some of the people I'm struggling with, if I tell them that story, I can actually just say, hey, can we go floss?
Like, it's like giving it's almost like the permission to let's go have this conversation.
I should just preface that to that, like not all feedback is negative.
Sometimes it's really great.
So I might not I might say to them, hey, we'll use the flossing analogy when it's like it's a do better feedback.
And then that that intros it as a hey, I got some tough stuff for you to hear.
Let's go floss.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
I like it.
And like I said, I never really thought about it until this moment, but it fits with my broccoli between your teeth analogy, too.

Tonya Campbell:
Oh, yeah, it does.
Dovetails very nicely.

Christine Laperriere:
We've built a fantastic metaphor for giving feedback on a regular basis, but we don't want you to be caught with broccoli between your teeth.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah.
Let's see how flossing goes in the banking world.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.
That's right.
I like it.
But I think these are really interesting ideas.
And I think, you know, maybe as people who are out there listening and are aspiring to be great bosses, I guess my question for you today is, you know, what what things would you like them to walk away with that you feel are helping you in your pursuit?

Tonya Campbell:
That's a good question.
Helping me in my pursuit is there's a couple of things I would say, just like my own development.
It's something that I think about on a regular basis.
I kind of build it into my like, you know, instead of having my head down and working hard all the time, I do stop periodically in my development and think about those things.
And what usually brings me back to, you know, refocusing and checking in on myself would be actually thinking about the best bosses I've had and emulating them.
So when I talk about the trust and when I talked about this sort of newer focus of feedback, it's because those bosses, those great bosses before me were really great at those things.
So for me, it's about emulating what worked well for me and what really inspired me to, you know, want to be a good leader in the first place.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing, amazing.
Thank you so much, Tanya, for coming on the show again.
I really appreciate it.
And I think people will be thinking about this as they move forward, being a good receiver of feedback and being a good deliverer of regular feedback.

Tonya Campbell:
It was my pleasure, and I hope everybody flosses regularly.

Title: This is extreme integrity
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: James Vasquez

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I am so excited to have James on the show.
He reached out to the show and had some really inspiring ideas of who his best boss was, best bosses, and so today I'm going to be here to interview James.
James, welcome, and please introduce yourself.

James Vasquez:
Thank you so much for having me on your show.
I really appreciate it.
My name is James Vasquez for our listeners out there.
I'm an entrepreneur.
I own several businesses, one of which is called Learn How to Start a Business, where I train and educate people how to start their own business.
So for me, your show is perfect because I'm an educator at heart, and I have learned so much from previous bosses that I felt compelled to reach out to you.
So thank you for having me.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
These are really fun because, again, they're not a setup, right?
We don't know each other, so we're getting a chance to have this perfect conversation that I love.
I always say it's my favorite airport conversation.
You're sitting there waiting for your plane, and you say, who is your best boss?
Tell me about him.
So with that, I'm going to dive right in, and I'm going to say, tell us about those best boss or best bosses that inspired you to reach out.

James Vasquez:
Sure, Christine.
It's so funny you say that about airport conversations and so forth, because I think that this subject matter is something that we all can relate to in some way or another.
I mean, we've all had bosses in the past, some great, some not so great.
Right.
So for me, I feel that I wanted to reach out to you only because I've had both experiences, and one thing is the huge takeaway that I've had is that you can learn something from a bad boss almost as much as you can learn something from a really good boss.
So that was something I wanted to reach out to you for.
I just like to kind of tell it as it is.
As we were talking, I'm from Brooklyn.
I'm born in New York.
I'm a New Yorker, so I just like to tell it straight.
I don't like to hold anything back.
So that was really what I wanted to reach out to the show for.
And for me, I've actually been able to identify at least two key bosses, if you will, in my career that have helped, I guess, formulate my way of thinking, my actions, my behaviors, and so forth.
And I think for me, at least, Christine, the way I've identified what, in essence, makes a quality or good boss or even just some type of leader is, number one, they should have effective communication.
I believe that you really need to be able to effectively listen and be able to communicate to your employees, to your fellow staff members, or whoever it is, just to provide clear instruction.
You have to really be able to understand their needs and concerns.
So I really believe that's one of the top for me.
You also have to have the, I guess, empathy.
You have to be able to really have that ability to understand and manage to be able to respond to your team, to your people, because at the end of the day, we are all humans, and we all need to be able to understand that.
And that's what we always have to maintain in terms of our communication, at least, again, the way I see it.
And lastly, you really have to be fair.
You have to have fairness.
You have to be able to have a high-level integrity, because at the end of the day, you're making decisions that impact other people's lives, the business that you're running, or the business that you're working for.
And you really have to have your team or your people confiding you, because at the end of the day, everything is about teamwork, and a leader or a boss is just kind of the figurehead or the person responsible for getting things done.
So I think those three, in my opinion, are what identifies a quality leader.
So I have two of which I found in my thought processes, as I was preparing for the show, or actually when I reached out to you.
And coincidentally, they were both actually at the same company that I worked at, just at two different segments of my career.
And we're going back a few years.
So the company was a manufacturer of entertainment and consumer goods products, including confections.
That was the category of company.
They were a big company.
They had, geez, I don't even know how many employees, to be honest with you, but they were doing about 500 million in sales.
So they were not a small company.
They have world-recognized brands and so forth.
So the position that I worked with this first boss that I'll mention was I was literally her second-in-command.
So she ran the entire department, and it was me and her, and then we grew together organically the department.
So I was involved in a lot of the decision-making.
I was involved in a lot of the hiring and so forth.
But essentially, she was the boss, and she was hired to do such.
So one of the things that I like to say, and again, given my three qualities, she was a horrible communicator.
She was brilliant.
Don't get me wrong, Christine.
She was literally off the charts in terms of intelligence.
I can't even remember what her IQ was, but I will tell you, she was an avid reader.
She would read almost a book a day.
I mean, she was off the charts smart, and I think that was a detriment because she felt everyone else should be at that level.
So her communication, and that's where the disconnect was, and I like to study people and how they act and forth.
So for me, it was very interesting to learn more about her and her background and how she came about because she had very clear ideas of what it meant to her to be in charge.
And a lot of it was from her upbringing.
I mean, all of us are impacted by that in some way, shape, or form, her to a very high level.
And her intelligence was such that she leave anything almost to anyone to assume she, but she didn't clearly communicate it.
So for me, the first step was she wasn't a clear communicator.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you just tell me real specifically, what can you can remember about?

James Vasquez:
Absolutely, Christine.
There were several occurrences.
So one of such was we had to manage the marketing department, as well as the creative development for the particular brands to be able to get them into the marketplace.
So one of the things that we had met with one of the marketing leaders was to be able to communicate on package what the unique selling proposition was and what would make it so that a consumer will be able to instantly pick it up on shelf because it was an impulse purchase.
It was at the checkout in the supermarkets and so forth.
So she went in and she didn't explain specifically anything that was what the marketing leader said.
What I heard, which was what he said specifically, was about the color scheme.
He said the color scheme should be red and yellow.
He said the price point is 97 cents.
He said, I want it on pack.
I want it to really be clear to the consumer what the price point is.
He also said the flavor name has to be something very key because I want them to know what they're purchasing, what the flavor is, and I want them to be able to readily find it.
These are all the things that I remember.
I was in the meeting with her when she went back to our team and we had a team of graphic designers and we had a team of production artists.
She kind of went back and just mentioned to them the top line.
We need a pack that's going to stand out at retail.
That's all she said to them.
And I said, well, we have a little more direction than just that.
And she said, well, they should figure that out.
And that was not fair to me in terms of thinking, well, we know the information.
Why aren't we just stating it rather than having a team spend time and invest resources and money to do something where they may not hit the mark?
So that was a point where I just saw that she, in her head, she knew what they were looking for.
So then Christine, fast forward after they followed through with what her directives were, they missed the mark.

Christine Laperriere:
Of course they did.
They didn't know red and yellow.
They didn't know pricing.

James Vasquez:
Yep.
A hundred percent.
So their perception of what was the objectives based on what she gave them wasn't in fact what the marketing leader said.
So we wound up failing at that.
We had to go subsequent rounds and so forth.
So for me, I felt that, okay, communication is absolutely an abundantly important subject to be sure in a leader that you are.
Now, what is funny, Christine, with that same boss of mine, I did learn something positive in the communication realm.
So with her, she was poor at communicating verbally in person to people.
But remember, I told you she was brilliant.
She was very smart.
But on the other side of the coin, she was a masterful communicator with the written word.
She remembers she read a lot.
So she knew how to communicate effectively in emails and she used it as a CYA.
I don't know if you know what CYA is.
Can I say that for our listeners?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, please.

James Vasquez:
So CYA is cover your ass.

Christine Laperriere:
Of course.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now I got you.
We all know what that is.

James Vasquez:
So what I've learned and keep in mind, I worked with her many, many years ago.
I was very young in my career.
So I learned this from her too, in that if somebody said they were going to do something, approve something or so forth, she never took their word for it.
She always wrote an email, you know, dear so-and-so, based on our conversation, you said you would have approvals on this date, blah, blah, blah.
And she would continue to go that way.
And she copied everybody on the email.
It wasn't just like that person's boss.
It was the entire, pretty much the entire company.
So I learned several things from that.
Number one, CYA is very important, especially in corporate America.
Number two, she was coming up in a company that was male dominated.
And she was a high level employee in this role.
So I understood why she was doing it, because it was so easy for others to point the finger.
And again, it was a male dominated old boys club, you know, it was an older company.
So I saw how she was doing this.
She was a trailblazer.
And I really respected her for that because I saw how she was able to effectively communicate.
Her boss, which was my boss boss, loved her because he didn't have to do anything to get her where he wanted her to be.
It was less work for him.
So he was cool with it.
But I learned that you have to effectively communicate and make sure that you're hitting the targets that you're looking to achieve.
So that was a positive thing that I've learned with her.
And when I define our three topics that I mentioned that I feel make a good leader, I also feel that you can learn positively and negatively from that.
So that was a positive thing from her.
One other thing that I would like to point out that I've learned from her was, again, her ineffectiveness of her communicating with staff was also a result of managing her stress levels.
Now, you and I know people handle stress in many different ways.
And I'm not here to say that I'm an excellent manager of stress.
I'm just saying I know that there are so many ways to manage it.
And I think we could agree certain ways that probably aren't productive.
And she chose that route.
For example, we would come out of a major meeting with the top level directors.
And maybe it was announcing a new product.
Maybe it was doing something that required a short amount of time.
And they wanted it to be done completely in a vacuum time frame that is maybe a little unachievable.
But nonetheless, it's your job.
We got to get it done.
She would come out of that meeting, get the staff together and literally yell at them.
I'm talking like a yell as if you're reprimanding a child and saying, you better do this.
You're talking to grown professionals in an industry that this is what they were hired for.
And she treated, yeah, she beat them up literally.
And then this was the best part.
Then she would turn to me and say, okay, let's go to lunch.
What do you feel like for lunch?
And I looked at her like, you're bipolar.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Actually, you know, I'm just going to kind of pause there for a second.
So as soon as you say you have somebody with an extraordinary amount of IQ, sounds like failing a bit on the EQ.
But what I like is you're sharing kind of the strengths and what you learn from the strengths and the weaknesses and what you learn.
It's interesting to me because it does raise that question of is it smart for employees to really understand how to see what the best attributes are of this boss and to forgive a little bit of the not best, right?
Because sometimes we put people on a pedestal that they can't ever reach.

James Vasquez:
So, you know, your point is extremely well taken.
And for me, this was a constant conversation that other employees would have with me.
They always would come to me and like, James, how do you manage her so well?
How come she never lashes out at you?
All these things that would come to me.
And then they were like, I was the golden child, which I was yelled at a few times, but I would let her know that it was unacceptable.
And I would take her aside.
I never did it in public.
I would ask to speak to her in her office.
And I would throw back at her and say, you know, I just want to let you know, I fully understand the goals that you need me to achieve.
However, I don't appreciate the way you delivered them.
And maybe that wasn't your intent, but I want to let you know the way it was received and the way you did it in public may have not been the best choice for me.
And I'm just letting you know, because you may or not see it that way.
So I had a lot of conversations to kind of let her know, I'm not going to take that.
And the other thing that to your point, I've done that with other people, not just my boss, but colleagues of mine, I would learn what makes them tick.
Why do they respond a certain way?
You know, the old adage, oh, everybody's motivated by money.
That's not true.
That's not true at all.
You know, there are many reasons why people do tasks.
There are many reasons why people don't want to do tasks.
So for me, I do learn a lot about person, the people, the team, the clients I'm working with, because all of that, it plays such a key role.
Like I said earlier, we're all humans until AI takes over the world.

Christine Laperriere:
Right now we're still all humans.

James Vasquez:
Yeah.
And that's really the important thing that I take away from her all the time.
I always remember.
And with that situation about the staff meetings, I've had companies where I've had multiple people on my staff and I've been put in very stressful situations.
And I've learned to take a breath, recompose myself before I speak to anybody.
And then I would gather the team together, let them know what the subject was about and explain to them what it was.
And I would side with them saying, okay, I know that what we're being asked is maybe something that's going to be very tough to deliver, but I'm here to help you in any way can, but we need to be able to put forth our best effort and achieve the challenges.
So it's definitely something that I've learned.
And I would have conversations with her, Christine, where I used to tell her, you need to see a therapist.
And she would laugh at me.
She'd be like, oh, you're so funny.
I said, no, I'm being serious.
And then she would say to me, why do I need a therapist?
I have you.
And she would talk to me.
I was like, I'm not a professional.
Yeah, we could talk and we could share information.
But I said, there's things that you need to work on.
And I'm happy to say that when I did speak with her, and when I did explain how maybe she didn't see it through the lens of the people receiving it, she was softer at times, not always, but it did impact her in a way.
So we had a really good collaboration.
I mean, in terms of that development of that company, we really escalated it.
It was the best run department.
Fantastic.
So she actually wound up leaving the company for a lot of different reasons.
We were being taken over to the public and so forth.
So I wound up running the entire division my own, which was to the relief of so many people only because they know how she was so hard.
But I'll tell you, Christine, as much as I'm not going to be that person that yells at you, I get what I want because I'm very direct and I like to be able to work with people who are competent.
And I made sure I worked with the people that weren't the ones that weren't.
I let go.
And that's how I've been in my career.
That's how I am today with my companies.
And so one of the other bosses that I can share with you at that same company.
And this is something where this this gentleman was well, like throughout the organization, he rapidly accelerated through the ranks through his his merit because he was an achiever.
He went to bad.
He was not one of these person that would say that's not my job.
He did whatever it took.
And I respected him because he would understand if I needed his review or approval on something by a certain date and time.
He would ask me, he said, James, I can't get to until tomorrow.
Is that OK?
What time tomorrow can I give you to approve that so you can get what you need done?
He understood the big picture.
And that was something in a small nugget I took away where today I still do this, where I tell people I need this back by this day, this time, because of him.
Because I think people don't realize that that you think you know when you need it back by, you know, in order to take that next step.
Right.
But you don't tell people if you don't tell people they don't know.
So I make them aware of it.
They may not need to understand the entire process, but at least if you explain I need this back by this time, this day, you gave them the time and date so they could be held accountable.
And again, if you're dealing with the right professional.
So now this is the biggest thing that in terms of remember I outlined in terms of being a leader.
One of the top things that I say is fairness and integrity.
Now this is an example of extreme integrity.
So one of the clients that we had as a business to this company is this small company, you might have heard of them, they're called Walmart.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, so probably an important customer.

James Vasquez:
Yeah, in any business today, Walmart, no matter who you are, is still a very large company to anybody.
And this company was no different.
Any order from Walmart was a minimum of a million dollars.
Not even kidding.
If they call, everybody would run and do whatever it took.
So we had this opportunity with Walmart to put in our product in a display tray.
And it was going to be what's called an end cap.
And for people who don't know an end cap is when you're walking up and down the aisles, you have your product displayed and is very prominently displayed.
It's usually pushed with a lot of marketing and advertising.
So we had this opportunity.
So for us, we were able to create the artwork in-house, manufacture it, we manufacture it in the states.
So it was easy for us to do.
So we were able to do this.
But throughout that process, there's a lot of approvals that were needed.
And my boss was one of the final stops and he approved the price point of 49 cents for the product, which was to be prominently printed on the tray because it was this promotion, an in and out promotion, meaning it was going to drop for the store.
It's going to be in for a very short time and come out.
But it was like a million dollar order.
So that price was a retail price, 49 cents.
So it went to market, printed, it was displayed.
And then all of a sudden, we got all these phone calls.
And my boss came up to me.
He's like, James, he's like, who approved the 49 cents price point?
And I said, well, you did.
And then it went through other channels.
And then he said, can you pull the job jacket so I could see the history?
So I did.
And we went through every department, legal, everything.
And it was even on the materials that you have to follow to be able to produce the item, everything.
And it was on there.
And it was wrong price point.
It was supposed to be 88 cents.
So you're looking, yes, at 50% off of the retail margin.
So the CEO is obviously completely involved in this looking to find out who approved this.
So he said, my name's on this.
So I'm going to say, I approve this.
And he literally took all the blame, despite there being like 12 other people that could have caught it, that should have caught it.
He didn't care.
He said, it's under me.
I'm going to tell him that I approved it.
And he did.
He knew that he could lose his job.
And it was over a million dollar order.
And he went to the CEO, and he talked to them.
And he expressed to them that this was something that I approved.
And he took the fall for it, took the blame for it.
The company lost a lot of money.
And he was just, for me, that show, the highest form of integrity is stood by me forever, even till this day.
And I just remember he was shocked because he was, I can't believe I approved it too.
But at the end of the day, he took the fall.
And he said, I'm just doing what's right, because I don't want anyone else to lose their job.
He said, if I lose my job, I'll deal with it.
He didn't lose his job.
About a year later, he was actually promoted.
And I think a lot of it had to do with his integrity and his well-being within the company.
But for me, Christine, when you talk about best bosses, I don't know of another characteristic that would really shine more than that.
Because in corporate America, a lot of times you're always looking out for your job, and you're always wondering about covering your ass.
And he did completely the opposite.

Christine Laperriere:
Because I coach about 100 professionals a year, I hear so many cover-your-ass stories and so many times when people are terrified of blame, and they're so scared of who's going to take the fall.
And I just think, why did we make the environment like that?
Because it is true that if a team plays a game, it's likely one person's going to drop the ball and it's going to suck.
But when do you just stand up for the fact that, yeah, I made a mistake?
I think that we haven't created cultures that permit you to make a mistake.
And I love that he just stood up for it.
And all of a sudden you have a culture that says, sometimes we mess up and we're not going to take it lightly, but we're also not going to say that it's a culture where you can't ever have a mess up.

James Vasquez:
Oh, you're 100% right, Christine.
And today, like I said, a lot of the times, like you, I do coaching and mentoring and so forth and establishing businesses.
And one of the things that I talk a lot about is mindset and also establishing your culture as to what you want your business to be.
Because at the end of the day, that resonated with me so much so throughout my career.
And I've taken stand for other people.
I've taken the responsibility.
I've lost money because of it.
But at the end, I felt so much better knowing that I was able to take the responsibility and be able to not point the finger like so many other people like to do.
So I think it's extremely important, just like you said, developing that culture and that acceptance to understand at the end of the day, we are all human and we have to understand that.
And you're going to have a bad day at times.
And sometimes a bad day, bad things happen.
The mistakes happen.
They're going to happen.
We just have to be able to learn from them.
And then there might be something in the system faltering when a mistake like that happens so that you can review where you have opportunities to be able to grow from it.

Christine Laperriere:
I have a thing when I'm working a lot of the times with leaders where I'll talk about if something big fails, let's look at the process and not the people.
Because at the end of the day, people don't go to work looking to mess up.
People don't go to work looking to lose a million dollars worth of profit on a product.
So it just tells me that if you actually take the energy off the people and you go, okay, let's look to the process.
What happened here?
How did eight people sign off on this?
So what was the process?
So you could even go back and go, okay, well, how were they able to know whether or not it was the right price when they got the information?
So you could look at that, but then take the onus off.
But because this person demonstrates that extreme integrity, there's a conversation that can be had about that.
If we're just going to shoot the that we blame and fire them and package them off they go, we don't set the culture up for analyzing a process.
We don't set the culture up for permission to make a mistake.
You know what I mean?
And now your cover your ass process has become where you spend 50% of your time.

James Vasquez:
You know what?
You're 100% right.
And then whatever that is, you'll find people taking more time to do things.
And they may not be doing it right, but they want to make sure that the process doesn't stop with them because they want to cover their ass and they want to make sure that they so they're you're 100% right.
And it was due to the process and the system.
So I'm happy the way he resolved it.
He went on to do great things.
He wound up becoming a really high profile person in the company.
Subsequently, he wound up leaving to start his own company.
So he did just wonderful things.
I'm still in touch with him at times and we share information.
I always remind him of that story.
He actually forgot about it.
So for me, I feel good when I share it with him and mention it to him and that it's stayed with me for a long time.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, what's cool about that is that's probably just him being him.
So he didn't think of it.
You know, he doesn't that's even probably a more of a testament to who he is because he didn't think of it as him being bold or courageous.
He was just being who he is.
And so you reminding him he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I did.
You know, like for him, it was just another day at work doing the right thing.

James Vasquez:
You know, you know what, Kristy, you're 100% right.
That's how he was.
That's who he was.
So and it was it was very stressful.
The entire company is very stressed during that moment.
And those weeks leading up to that product launch, it actually wound up really becoming a success, to be honest with you also, where I guess it encouraged more consumer trial because of the lower price point, which obviously that was not the goal.
Having a new product in Wal-Mart at a price that was like almost a no brainer for the consumer to try, wound up to have sales skyrocketed.
Now, I don't remember if at this point, if we profited, I remember we lost a lot, but I don't know where it netted out in the long run.
But that that brand today is almost the number one selling brand at that company.

Christine Laperriere:
Interesting.
That's so cool.
Like I said, I love these stories.
So I know you also talked about empathy as one of your really important attributes of a leader.
Any interesting stories or tidbits where you were able to see that?

James Vasquez:
So for me, empathy, I actually hadn't had any bosses who really displayed the empathy that I talked about.
That actually comes more for myself, believe it or not.
I had a situation where I was in charge.
I was at a different company, but I had people report directly to me and I was responsible.
And I had this one new hire came on the job, like the top guy, like you wanted this person to be on your team.
And that's how he sold himself.
That's how he presented himself.
So I was anxious and excited to have him.
And then for whatever reason, within the first couple of weeks, that flame kind of fizzled out.
And I was like, yeah, I don't know what's going on with this guy.
And then I noticed that in our meetings, he was falling asleep.
I was like, what's going on?
Like his head would just literally bob.
And I had noticed he was very disengaged.
And for me, I was like, all right, this guy's got to go.
I've got to cut him loose.
And then I gave him one chance.
I told him, I said, listen, just want to let you know, I've been noticing and I told them what I just shared with you.
He didn't make any excuses.
He said, I promise I'll be fine.
I'll be better.
It's okay.
Didn't tell me anything.
So then a week goes by the same behaviors.
So I pulled them aside and I said, listen, I have to get HR in on this now, because we talked about this.
I documented this what's going on.
So finally, he discloses to me that he's going some medical situation, which he should have said in the first place, but he didn't.
He was trying to protect it and just didn't want anyone to know.
And I explained to him that privacy is the most concern of mine.
I would never ever let anyone know that.
But he kind of confided in me.
So for me, I had to now have these emotions where, okay, he's not really doing his job.
That's the bad part about it.
But I had to understand his viewpoint or what he's going through because it's directly impacting his ability to perform.
So for me, I gave him the day off.
I said, don't worry, we'll pay for the day.
Just go home, regain your thoughts and so forth and come back.
So with that, he came back the next day refreshed.
He was taking some meds that were causing him sleepiness and drowsiness.
So he stopped that.
He got some other description.
He came to me and thanked me for just understanding.
So for me, when I say about empathy, I had never had a boss do that.
So for me, I've always been like, oh, go forward.
Even if you have a bad night's sleep, you should go to work and you should perform.
That's what you're expected.
But I've learned through the years that you do need to be able to empathize with people.
You need to be able to understand where they're coming from, because at the end, you want that to be given to you also.
So for me, that's something that is very important in everything I do today.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.
And it's a great story and a great example because I wonder sometimes is empathy one of those skills that is acquired through experience?
When I'm working with leaders, especially older leaders, it becomes easier because they have had a life experience where they were hoping somebody would be empathetic with them.
I'll work with people, pre-kids and post-kids, two totally different levels of empathy.
And I'll take one, I'll step right out and admit this.
Before I had kids, it was like, why do I have to do somebody else's job just because they have kids?
Why do I have to, why does so-and-so get to come in at 930 and I got to be out of bed at seven, like all those things.
Now I have two kids and it's like, oh gosh, just somebody throwing me a bone once in a while really can make my day because it's not that I'm not doing my best.
It's just that there's simply not enough of me to do everything perfect all the time.

James Vasquez:
Doesn't that feel amazing?
Because you're 100% right.
Before I had kids, I would be like, how come I'm doing all this work and they come in at 930, 10 o'clock, and I would be the same way.
And then I have three kids and then I started becoming the person that was having to come in at 930 or having to stay late because I just didn't have the energy and the wherewithal.
So for now, I have a lot of empathy for any working parent doing anything with children and any age.
Everybody says younger kids, any age is a challenge for parents, especially today with everything that's going on in the world today.
I feel that you really need to have that empathy.
And it's funny because I've had, I guess, a mix of clientele that have no empathy at the older ages and younger empathy because I have some that are just steadfast and say this is how it should be.
And they're having this utopia that maybe they should be a certain way and the younger generation needs to get with it.
And then I have others like you mentioned where they're more understanding and they've had help in the past.
So they want to do that for others.
So it's just an interesting dichotomy sometimes.

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny when you're talking about that.
I'm just going to share my really quick story on extreme empathy.
I have a client out of Halifax, great, great, great leader.
And about eight years ago, oh, maybe almost 10 now, I had a concussion.
I had an accident and ended up with this very serious concussion.
And so it was very interesting because I have one client, again, very large courier company client.
And I said, I'm really struggling with this concussion.
And that leader said, listen, I'm in Germany.
I need you to meet me at 430 or 5 a.m.
I was meeting him at 5 a.m.
And I'll never forget this.
I got on the call with him.
And there was something wrong with the formatting of the slide deck that I sent him.
And he just proceeded to chew me out for the slide deck.
And I'm working with a concussion and I'm getting out of bed at 5 a.m.
for this meeting.
And I just got off the line and I was destroyed.
But in the same exact breath, the CEO of another company that I work with, I said, I just had this concussion.
And he said, I want you to invoice me right now.
I don't want you to lose a moment of sleep over cash flow.
And you know what, Christine, we just want you to get better when you're ready to come back and do stuff for us.
We'll make it all work in the long run.
But I don't want you to stop invoicing me.

James Vasquez:
That's incredible.

Christine Laperriere:
I will never forget that.
It was like these two extremes.
And I like to this day, I mean, I've even featured people that work for him on the best boss show because I know he's a boss, you know, and it's so special to think that, you know, he had that impact of extreme empathy to the point where I can't forget him.
I cannot forget working for him because he was just phenomenal for that.

James Vasquez:
Well, one other thing that he displays and I don't know the gentleman, but what you're sharing with me makes me believe another quality that a lot of great leaders should have and do have at times is what you're expressing here is gratitude.
You know, he's giving you this gratitude that he doesn't want you to lose any money.
He doesn't want you wants you to get well.
And I think that is tremendous because a lot of times people do forget to have that and to display that.
And I think that is just such a great story.
Thanks so much for sharing that because that was wonderful.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, you had all those great stories for your other attributes.
And I'm like, I happen to know somebody who has your extreme empathy nailed, you know, and you're right.
And I went on to refer great people into that business.
You know, I've done anything for him that I can because, you know, that's what's so neat when you work for people who display some of these qualities is like the golden path that follows them.
Right.
That simple moment.
He just said, hey, listen, you know, send me your invoice right now.
I'm going to pay it literally, you know, eight years of loyalty out of me.
That's like, you know, bar none.
If he calls and says I need something, it's jump how high, you know, that's great.

James Vasquez:
Absolutely.
Of course.

Christine Laperriere:
And similar to some of these other people, right?
Where this extraordinary integrity, right?
Like you would, you know, if that person calls you and asks you for something, it's like, how high do you need me to jump?

James Vasquez:
That's the reciprocation.
You're 100% right.
And that's what you get from those experiences.
And there's, you know, conversely, there's others that you're like, oh, I don't want to take this call.
Send that to voicemail.
But you are right.
We have the ones where you have this fantastic experience.
They show the human side of things where, you know, they experience things and want to take care of you and they respected you.
So I think that's wonderful.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Very cool.
Well, listen, this has been an incredible conversation.
I have obviously a ton of questions, but we're just running out of time.
The last one I'm going to ask you though, and I love to ask people this question.
I think you gave us so much good meat today.
What do you think the financial impact is of working for a best boss?
Because this comes up for me and my business all day long, right?
Why would we spend money on supporting people to become a best boss?
And so what do you think it is?

James Vasquez:
You know, that's a great question.
I don't know the specific statistics and I'm sure they're with respect to you could have a measurable result from having a best boss versus not.
I will let you know from my experience from when that experience that I have from that boss who wasn't the best boss, but she got things done after she left the company.
Now, there were a lot of things that did happen, but I was the person in charge.
I essentially took over her role and a couple of other roles just kind of ran things and I ran things very differently than she did.
And I have people literally write to HR, write to the CEO about how I treat them with respect.
I work with them.
I'm able to roll up my sleeves because that other boss, she didn't do any of that.
She just made everyone else do the work and just kind of took all the credit.
So I believe that from a financial standpoint, you could have a direct measurable positive result in providing the resources when you do have somebody who is a best boss to continue that, to make sure that that's something that you invest with them to kind of embrace it, to increase how they could become even better and really utilize that.
I've seen in my own businesses the way I've treat people a positive manner.
They want to do more work.
They want to be doing things.
They ask for more responsibilities.
They don't mind working later if they have to.
I just see a positive overall culture like we were talking about, and I just see that they are more willing and able to do things.
And that brings more clients.
In my type of business, it actually helps where people want to work with that type of outlook and that type of person.
So for me, I believe there's a direct positive financial aspect in an outlook with a best boss that way.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
No, I think it's absolutely the truth.
And even just when we got on the phone and you mentioned how amazing Grace is, it's like I've been so lucky to retain and work with her for so many years.
And she is.
You can't help but love her.
She's just got that gift.
So I always am on a mission to try to keep her happy because it's such a good example, though, of where you get to hold on to somebody who cares, cares about the business.

James Vasquez:
Exactly.
They're doing it for other reasons than financial gain.
They care.
They won't want to be a part of it.
They understand the mission, and they just want to be able to make a difference.
So yeah, Grace is a keeper.
She's awesome.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Thank you, James.
This was a fantastic interview, and I know people are going to get a lot from this conversation.
Thank you so much.

James Vasquez:
Christine, thank you so much for having me.
I've enjoyed our conversation as well.
And if anybody gets one nugget of information that they could take with them the way I've taken from my bosses, I would be so happy.

Title: Give to the universe and it gives back
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Joshua Elrich

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I am bringing on Joshua, and I'm going to have Joshua introduce himself in a minute.
But yet again, what I really love is that as we have started to grow a stronger presence with The Best Boss Show, there are people that are listening to the show and catching the idea of it, and it's inspiring them to think about what their best bosses are.
And that's how Joshua and I got connected.
So, Josh, thank you so much for being on the show.
I'll hand it over to you so you can do a quick introduction, and then we'll get started.

Joshua Elrich:
Thank you, Christine.
Yeah, I'm excited to talk about this.
I went down a trip of memory lane thinking about best bosses, so I'll share some stories.
I've been a leadership coach for the last 25, 26 years, psychologist by training before that, researcher.
And most of what I do is leadership coaching, and I love that work.
And when I'm not doing that, I'm teaching mindfulness and mindful leadership.
And so I get to do stuff that I love and help people grow and change.
So that's a joyful thing.
But I didn't get there kind of on my own.
There was people, best bosses, and mentors, maybe we'll get to, that really helped me develop the professional confidence and skill set that I have.
So very grateful for them.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and dive in.
I'll give you the question.
Who are the best bosses, I'll say, that you've experienced and or learned something really transformational from?
The first one that came to mind is name is Jerry.
And it struck me from the very first meeting, my first interview, he created the safe space for me and showed this incredible interest in me.
And I ended up sharing so much more about myself, my personal life that I intended.
He opened me like a can opener.
He was a professional interviewer and that was his thing.
He was an assessor.
And that's what he ended up teaching me was how to assess leaders.
But I was not prepared for that.
And I just thought, oh, my gosh, what have I done?
I said, I'm never going to get this job.
And yet, sharing all this personal stuff about my own spiritual journey and starting to meditate and stuff.
Actually, he was very interested and thought that was great.
So I didn't flop.
He hired me and subsequently taught me to trust my intuition and my gut using that incredible, supportive, essentially loving stance that he had.
I didn't think of it at the time, but as I think back on it now, that's really what he was expressing.

Christine Laperriere:
He was able to express that kind of loving presence for you.
I love the fact that you mentioned he was a professional interviewer.
So it's like he was able to ask the questions that really got to the heart of who you are.

Joshua Elrich:
So it was the questions and even not even just the question.
It was just that he would listen.
He was a really good listener.
And as I started thinking and I always think about principles, what are the themes, empathy, and listening are top of my list?
Because that showed his support for me and interest in me.
It wasn't just, OK, I'm going to tell you and teach you because he had years that he could give me.
But what I really took away was his belief in me.
That started with the next, the biggest assignment we started with is he asked me to research the best assessment tools out there.
He had been using the same tools for like 10, 15 years and they were old.
I mean, he loved them and they were like his magic crystal ball.
But he wanted me to go find him the new things.
And I just thought, this is wild.
And I dove into it, brought them to him.
He was very open to experimenting with them.
And I ended up teaching him hypnosis.
I mean, he's just so open.
Even though he had years of experience and great skills, he was open to learning from me.
So what I took away was I must have something.
I was this graduate student.
I knew nothing and felt I had no kind of things to add.
And he showed me that I had tremendous things to add.
And that, to my confidence, just blossomed.
My professional identity blossomed.
So that's really what I got from him.
Wow.
I love that.
Love that story.
So that was Jerry.
So then kind of as you start thinking, what other bosses created that impact for you?
Well, the same one actually going further back into college, research named Christy, she was teaching me how to do research.
I'd never done research and how to publish that research.
But as I think about it, it was the same incredible sense of loving support that I got from her.
It was just this sense of interest in me, but also I could mess up.
But there was a sense of it's okay.
Compassion might be the word.
And so just thinking about that, it really brings tears to my eyes how much there was this holding for me.
And so Christy and Jerry both gave me that.
And then, interesting.
So Jerry was looking for a successor.
And it was kind of one of the few good examples of succession planning.
He actually retired and I took over his seat in that consulting practice doing leadership assessment.
And what I then had was a new boss, essentially his partner at the time.
I'll call him Rich for sake of anonymity, but very different kind of boss, but incredibly transformative for me.
So not this kind of sweet loving presence.
And so I learned from him how to coach by coaching side by side with him.
So this was not like, okay, we debrief it later.
Well, we did debrief, but we would coach people together.
And so I'd go to visit clients with him.
And that was just incredible because he was right to not send me alone.
And watching him do it.
So there's modeling there, how to coach people, how to build relationships with clients, how to run a business.
He knew that much better than Jerry did.
And the other thing that I was thinking about, Christine, was so amazing.
And I wrote about this actually when I wrote my book years ago.
He would interrupt himself to listen to me.
So we'd be talking and I would take in a breath of air as if I'm going to speak.
And he would interrupt him, he would stop.
And I feel bad because I actually wanted to hear what he was going to say.
And I had no experience, there's nothing important that I was going to say.
And I asked him to explain this.
And he said, well, when I'm speaking, I'm not learning.
And it was just so powerful to me.
Like, yes, he too wanted to learn.
Even if it wasn't important, what he taught me was, wow, I should shut up and listen better.
So that was Richard.
And really learned again about business and building relationships with clients and also about listening in a different way.

Christine Laperriere:
Can I get you to even expand a little bit about what it was like to sit next to him as he was coaching?
So obviously, you didn't really know a lot about coaching at that moment in time.
And so you're sitting and you're observing him.
Tell me, like, what did he do well as a coach?
Like, what were the things that you started to pick up on?
You know, all of us want to learn how to be great coaches.

Joshua Elrich:
You know, and again, I'd start with that listening.
He was a great listener, even though he was impatient and had ADD.
He actually reminded me, he took a pad of paper with him.
And whenever he's on the phone or with a client person, he would be doodling.
He learned that to quiet his mind and to focus.
And he would write notes about what the person was saying, but he'd also draw pictures and stuff.
He would use that to help him focus.
And so, you know, as much as he had incredible expertise and could do the mentoring and telling thing, he didn't.
And so what I learned from him was how to really help people from the inside out bring their insights forward and not be the guru in the room.
But somebody else really get to where they wanted to go.
So that was good.
The other thing that I realized that I learned from him, he had this expression he would say, when I give to the universe, it gives back.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that one.

Joshua Elrich:
He's a really hard-nosed business person.
But he had this philosophy of giving and that it wasn't just about, okay, go, go, take, take, you know.
It was about giving to clients.
And when you give, you get back.
Giving things away for free was his philosophy.
And what I learned, how does he build a relationship with clients?
He gave his time, his attention, his expertise for free.
And he built a very successful business.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that catchphrase.
I feel like it's a hard one to remember sometimes when you're in the business world.
So when you bring that one forward, you just relax a little bit, you know.

Joshua Elrich:
It's hard to trust it, but it is true.
And I've tried to live that, you know.
Just being there for people when they're between jobs or have gotten fired or going through a tough moment and they can't pay us as consultants.
But they need support and it's a relationship.
It's not a transaction.
That's something I learned from him and from Jerry and Christy too.
So that's, yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I really, really like that story.
You know, I know that we were talking as we were getting the show set up.
One of the things that this Best Boss Ever conversation also brings up for you is some memories about the not best boss.
The one that wouldn't win the title.

Joshua Elrich:
Yeah.
And you know, I think it's about ego because that boss was always competing with me to try to make himself feel good, to put himself up.
And one time, I'll never forget, I actually introduced him to a client of mine a group of clients that came to the meeting.
And he was putting me down in front of my own clients and I was just like, I could not believe what I was hearing.
And so, you know, when somebody's ego is more important than the client or me, it's just, it's incredible what that will do in terms of destructiveness.
And so, you know, I left that relationship and, you know, that was really why.
Because I didn't want to have a boss competing with me.
It's the opposite of what I was talking about before with Jerry and Christian and Rich, where they really were kind of putting me up and showing me that my expertise mattered.
And it wasn't about that.
They didn't need the ego.
They had kind of managed to develop their own confidence to that point that they didn't have to compete.
But this other fellow, you know, wasn't there.
So he was competing and I didn't learn from that.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Joshua Elrich:
And when you feel like, I think psychological safety is a big, you know, hot topic these days, but the minute that you think, you know, you're kind of going into the office and all of a sudden, like, you're competing with somebody sitting right next to you or sitting above you, you know, there's nothing psychologically safe about that.
And if I make the transfer to people that I've managed, and I haven't managed that many, but when I'm developing somebody, I'm trying to do that.
It's basically getting my own ego out of the way.
If it's my emotional need, if I'm critiquing something they've written or done, you know, is it my need to show that I'm better?
What's going on here?

Christine Laperriere:
So, can I ask you a question?
I personally have done an intense amount of training.
Kabbalah was probably the best training that I did in helping me really identify the difference between ego and connection to something bigger.
But I'm very mindful of, just like you said, where my ego sits sometimes when I'm interacting, because you're right, the minute I can move that out of the way goes back to being about the person in front of me, right?
You know, for all of us, it rears its ugly head.
So, question for you, how did you, you know, how have you grown to spot and manage ego in yourself and others, you know, in your journey?

Joshua Elrich:
I think that's a core of what we're trying to do when we're coaching leaders is help them manage their ego and manage their emotional needs.
One thing that we do a lot in coaching is giving feedback, right?
So, gathering 360 feedback and helping people be aware of their impact.
That's one place it comes out that they care about my clients.
They don't want to impact people negatively around them.
And so, they pay attention to that disconnect between intention and impact.
So, that's outside in.
Inside out is being aware, and you mentioned mindful.
So, mindfulness is a huge tool for me in helping myself and others be first, sane, and centered, and grounded.
Right, so first thing is if I'm stressed out, you know, if I greet the kids at the door of my wife, I'm not giving them my best self.
If I'm harried and fallow, I've got to spend a lot of time managing my own anxiety and stress so that I'm my best self.
So, that's the first grounded, centered, settled.
Number two is then, can I make the intention to give and care and ask about how am I, you know, how am I entering this conversation?
Is it with curiosity and empathy and listening, or is it with an agenda to fix or get off my chest of frustration?
What's going on for me emotionally?
So, that's a mindfulness of emotion.
So, we often think of mindfulness as a mind thing, but it's not just being clear in our heads.
It's being positive and centered in our hearts.
So, heartfulness is in some ways a better word for it.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's a really good distinction, right?
Moving the energy down here versus always up here, you know?

Joshua Elrich:
Great teacher who passed away last year, Thich Nhat Hanh, used to talk about the longest journey is that many miles from our head to our heart.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Joshua Elrich:
This sounds so soft, right?
So, our clients, Christina, hearted, practical people are like, oh, you know, heart, love, what are you talking about?
Actually, and you mentioned psychological safety.
The reason that's coming in is because we've over-shifted, too much logic and head in business and, oh, we don't have room for emotion.
And now we're realizing emotional intelligence and safety.
Well, where do we get that?
We get that working on our own ability to be understanding and empathic and compassionate.
And those are things that can be learned.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and I think, you know, to your point, the leaders that I work with want that.
I think a lot of people feel that their authenticity is kind of cut off right at the end of their executive function.
So, it's like, as long as I'm in, you know, using the logical part of my brain and I'm powering through problem solving, they feel like that's what the company wants out of them.
And then the minute that they move into an emotional state, they're kind of like, you know, that's not welcome here.
And what I've actually learned is culture is not built on executive function alone, right?
It's built on the human connection.
And, you know, we talk about engagement, right?
Like Gallup's, you know, one of Gallup's questions, I have a best friend at work, you know, and I always say that.
And that one actually is, interestingly enough, one of the biggest predictors of whether somebody is going to stay at an organization.
That's not, you know, executive function, right?
That's not ego.

Joshua Elrich:
And I've been thinking a lot about executive function recently.
And just if people don't know that term, that's planning, organizing, focusing.
And kids most need coming up and executives need it too.
And that's what, you know, mindfulness gives us.
And yet it's not the whole enchilada.
As you say, Christine, it's half at best.
And culture is built on emotional and safety and underlying values.
So absolutely.
You know, you also want to come back to mentors, Christine, because you mentioned mentors.
And I was thinking about best bosses.
And then I thought of somebody who wasn't really a boss.
But was incredibly pivotal for me as a mentor.
And if I think about that, there's some similarity to what I got in that sense of loving support.
But she was also tough and would not hold back.
So you mentioned head and heart, you know, I think it's a balance.
She would give me blistering feedback and not, you know, no love in that moment.
It felt hard and harsh.
But I needed to hear it.
And so I learned that part of things too, that it's not all about the warm and fuzzy.
It's how do you really be straight?
And there's some people who talk about straight talk and, you know, that kind of discipline, being brutally honest.
But it's within the context of a loving, supportive relationship where, you know, it's not about, again, I'm going to take you down because I feel like it or I can with the idea that I'm going to help you grow.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, I have this nickname for exactly what you're talking about.
And I call it the broccoli between your teeth conversation because, you know, what I've learned from doing over 50 of these best boss interviews, feedback always comes up as a topic, right?
And whether that's from a mentor or a boss or somebody that cares.
But what I always say is the broccoli between your teeth feedback is like, hey, you have broccoli between your teeth, like stop what you're doing, you know?
And I'm doing that not because I have ego or I enjoy that you look like a fool right now or I enjoy that everybody, you know, I'm doing that out of sheer compassion for you.
But if I don't give, you know, I'm not going to say like, excuse me, well, you know, and sometimes like, you know, it's like I don't, I'm not worried about your feelings in the moment because I'm actually protecting the bigger you and your success.
And so I think of it as like, how do we give feedback that just like you said, I hear this all the time, people that make a big impact, it's not the ones that gently gave feedback that, you know, didn't disrupt the apple cart or didn't have you, you know, you had no, you know, you didn't have a feeling when you heard that feedback.
Most of us, when we get that tough feedback, it's like, ouch, but then you get so much from that.

Joshua Elrich:
Right.
And so some of the things you're saying is important, you know, because people hear coaching and they think feedback.
And yes, feedback is part of coaching, but it's a small part.
The larger enchilada is do we create a safe space for this person to grow and think for themselves?
And then when we give feedback, it's in a container and that feedback, right, does not protect that person from their feelings.
I actually learned that from another mentor we could talk about.
But that's so pivotal.
We so often do each other harm by trying to protect each other from our feelings.
Can't protect each other from our feelings.
And the best way we can sometimes help people is to be straight, but with that sense of support for the person.
It's not brutal for the sake of hurting or being brutal.
Just because I can't think of a better way to say it.
It's with the gesture and the intention to help.

Christine Laperriere:
I really value when I hear those stories.
I can think of a time that I got tough feedback from a mentor, same exact thing.
And she said, while I was watching you facilitate in front of a room, she goes, you know your stuff, but you use self-deprecating humor to the point in which it's annoying.
And I was like, oh, but she was right.
I was on this mission to try to not look too egotistical in front of the room.
And so I was like treating myself like I was stupid in front of the room.
And she's like, there's no need for that.
And it was like, I mean, I felt like I had, I was embarrassed by the, you know, the tough moment, but I will never forget how thankful I am.
She could have saved me years of doing something that nobody else would ever had the heart to tell me.

Joshua Elrich:
It's a great story.
So if we are really open and want feedback, how do we get it?
Right.
She had a sense that she could give it to you, but so many people project that they're not interested.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Joshua Elrich:
You know, even before you say anything, you can see the defense in this coming up.
So showing that you're open and interested, the easiest way is to ask people for feedback, ask colleagues for feedback.
You know, there's coaches who made their living on that principle, just ask for feedback.
And it's really powerful.
And the first time yet, you know, I'll never forget when I was writing my book, the first time I had a developmental editor, his job was to give me feedback.
I thought, oh, he's going to give me, so I asked him for feedback and he said, oh, just keep doing what you're doing.
I said, okay, great.
I'll do that.
But I asked him for feedback again a month later.
And he said, yeah, you could change this a little bit here and there.
I was like, oh, great.
Thank you so much.
And I asked him for feedback a third time and a month again after that.
And he said, you know what?
You really need more stories.
You need to put more stories throughout the book.
And I was like, oh my gosh, this is huge.
It's going to take me another six months to write.
But that's so important.
And it was, but I had to ask him and it was his job.
I had to ask him three times.

Christine Laperriere:
And think of even the time wasted, right?
By you not seeing that challenge or issue or opportunity earlier, right?
And so I agree with you.
It's hard to hear at the time, but honestly, it's the biggest gift.
And I hear that as a theme in almost over half of these interviews.
People remember the person that gave them the tough feedback that once they got their broccoli out from between their teeth, they were like, wow, the show's going so much better now, you know?
Like, and they felt more confident in front of the room because somebody did actually point out that embarrassing thing.
Even you probably felt better writing that book when you finally got that candid feedback.

Joshua Elrich:
Well, yeah, because it rung true.
It was painful because I'd written a lot to that point that I had to then rework.
And you see there was going to be a ton of work ahead in the next few chapters.
And it's not easy for me to write and tell stories, but you've been great to draw them out.
But, you know, so it was painful in the moment, but so helpful longer term, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Any last words that you want people to hear today?
I really appreciated your stories.
I love the examples of the couple different bosses that came to mind, even though they were all kind of, they had different ways that they impacted you.
Just tell me a little bit if there's anything you really want leaders that are listening right now who are trying to figure out how to keep raising the bar.
What do they need to take away today?

Joshua Elrich:
Well, we've talked about, and I'm about to write an article about this, that empathy is the supremacy principle.
Empathy and listening right behind it.
And then curiosity.
We talked about managing our egos and our emotional needs and talked about mindfulness, being present, paying attention, guiding your own attention and guiding the attention of your team.
Okay, I need to be focused.
But actually, as a leader, a huge part of our job is focusing the attention of our teams.
People talk about alignment and strategic direction, but what does that come down to?
That everybody's attention is focused in the same direction.
And you can do that if you get a hold of your own first, and you can pay attention to others.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, I think your point on empathy and listening, I always take curiosity to me.
I kind of use it as like love in motion, because in the world of leadership, we don't use the word love very much.
It's like, we kind of almost in some ways don't have permission to go there.
But if I can challenge somebody to move to curiosity, like a genuine curiosity, if you think about it, when you've ever felt loved by another person, they were genuinely deeply curious.
So much that they wanted to listen to you.
So much that they wanted to understand you.

Joshua Elrich:
And a friend of mine recently was saying that he, he's a leader of 100 people, IT technology team.
He was saying, you know what?
That gets you to curiosity is humility, which gets us back to managing your ego.
So you can't just say, well, you should be humble.
But to be humble, we have to get our ego out of the way.
Once you can be humble, then you can be curious.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.

Joshua Elrich:
And you know what?
I want to tell one more thing about Jerry, which I just thought was amazing.
I, he had retired at this point.
I was at a conference and we were asked to share around a large round table about the best mentor boss we'd ever had, going back to your podcast.
And this other person was sharing and it sounded, I was like, that sounds like Jerry.
So I went up to him in a break and I said, who was that boss you were talking about?
He said, oh yeah, it's Jerry.
I said, I was my best boss too.
And so we compared notes and rows.
So it wasn't just me that Jerry had supported.
And this other colleague had the same experience.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that is fantastic.
Like what a riot.
Like, what do you think of that?
That is so interesting.

Joshua Elrich:
And as I learned, he had mentored many other people as well.
So it was not personal and it was personal.
Felt like he was just a special thing for me.
But then I realized, wait, he's doing this.
He's sprinkling this pixie dust with others too.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is so cool.
And I mean, to me, that's where, if you're really authentically being who you're being, then any person that interacts with him is getting that experience.
So that's pretty cool that he impacted people that all knew him or were around him and being led by him in the same way.
To me, that's like the top of the bar.

Joshua Elrich:
Yeah.
How do you make people feel?
Monitoring leadership, right?
How do you make people think, feel, and act?
But the feeling piece is underrated to your point earlier.
So are we thinking about how we make people feel post our interactions with them?
And what I took away was I think about Jerry and Kristy and Rich and Karen mostly on the love side.
It's how they made me feel.
It made me feel good about myself.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm keeping that as my last little nugget of wisdom that I'm going to put this up on my wall here.
How do you make people think, feel, and act?
I think that you nailed it.
Those three are so mission critical, but the feel is always the one that everybody skips.
The think, we feel like we can talk our way into it.
Act, we can just tell people what to do.
But feel...

Joshua Elrich:
It doesn't work because we jump over the feel piece.
If we connect to make them feel good and align with us and that we have a vision where we want to take you and you're inspired to go there with me as a leader, then you'll act.
And especially today, right?
Maybe 40 years ago, different generation, people would more be dutiful.
Today's, you know, people coming up, they don't want to just do it because you tell them.
They want to do it because they're inspired and they feel like they want to do it.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
I think that is an awesome closing remark to make everybody reflect on how are we all, you know, making people think, feel, and act when we're interacting with them.
Amazing.
Thank you, Joshua.
This was a great interview and I really appreciate your time.

Joshua Elrich:
My pleasure.
Wonderful talking with you.

Title: Willing to be a buffer
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Maureen Cawley

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I'm interviewing Maureen.
And again, I think this is so exciting when someone hears about the show.
We have been talking about the show all over the place on LinkedIn, and we've built some really great fellowship.
And Maureen heard about this show and it immediately inspired some thoughts for her on who her best boss was.
So Maureen, thank you so much for reaching out and offering to be interviewed.
And just for everybody listening, give us a little introduction on yourself before we get started.

Maureen Cawley:
Sure, so my name is Maureen Colley.
I am the Chief People Officer at a company called Sapa.
It's a direct-to-consumer company that sells luxury mattresses online.
It's a lot of fun.
We have an engineering and a marketing population.
We also have a large customer service population.
And we're the first people in the internet to do what we do.
So it's a great company to be part of.

Christine Laperriere:
Sounds good.
And so for anybody out there with back pain or a lousy sleep while they're listening to this, look Maureen up after.

Maureen Cawley:
That's right, Sapa.com.

Christine Laperriere:
When I ask that question, who's your best boss, ever, and why?
What comes to mind for you?

Maureen Cawley:
My best boss was my first boss.
And it jumps right out for me because I feel so lucky in my career to have started out with a best boss.
His name is Max Landsbaum, and he's sort of known for being a best boss.
He made his career.
He works in retail, and he kind of has two signature strengths.
One is that he can make almost any situation profitable.
And then the other is he's a tremendous developer of people.
So almost no matter who he works with, he can pull out of them whatever their strengths are and help them to be useful at their job.
So he was always great with people who were quirky or people who were different or people like me who didn't understand their job and might not have been doing so well right out of college.
And so that versatility in leadership is something that you see it valued more and more now, but he was sort of an early adopter of strength-finders, essentially.

Christine Laperriere:
What a one-two punch he has, the ability to make any situation profitable and a tremendous developer of people.
I listen to that and go, that's a very aspirational who I want to be when I grow up.

Maureen Cawley:
Could you imagine how lucky, too, to come out of college and start working with somebody like that?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, tell me a little bit about what it was like.
Give me the day-by-day examples of what it's like to work with Max.
Here you are, this fresh out of university or college grad.
Don't know where the bathrooms are, right?

Maureen Cawley:
Right, and at Target, that's where I started my career was Target.
They have an executive, they call it an executive leadership program.
And so what basically that means is you come into a field retail position and you're responsible for running a team of people and a department.
So you're 22 years old, you have a team of 25 people and you're supposed to drive results through this team who has more work experience than you, more retail experience, knows the environment better.
It was a pretty hard job.
And for me, I wasn't very good at it.
I had never worked in retail before, I wasn't a very good delegator and I definitely didn't understand some of the key components of feedback.
Meaning if I had feedback for an employee on my team, I was looking for a reaction from them to make sure they understood the message, which is wrong.
I mean, you end up pushing just way too hard on people.
And so Max kind of, you were saying you have a puppy by your desk, you kind of treated me like a puppy, like very broke it down to basics.
I remember one time I had this shoe transition, Target was doing this major change to how they presented footwear.
Right.
And I took the instructions, looked at the number of hours that it was supposed to take to complete the transition and decided, okay, I guess that's what I have to do.
Myself.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh no.

Maureen Cawley:
I remember I had an 18 hour work day.
The project was due.
It was every shoes were all over the place, in boxes, out of boxes.
Somebody from the overnight team tried to help me, but it was so bad, like just a complete fail.
And I remember Max came in in the morning and said, okay, Maureen, we have to go look at the shoe department.
You know, like a puppy, you're just so embarrassed.
You know, you did a bad job.
And we walked over and he said, okay, well explain this.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
So instead of kind of taking that opportunity to like kind of scold me or yell at me or any of which I could have deserved, he gave me a chance to provide my own feedback.
And I said, okay, well, I failed to delegate.
I tried to do it all by myself.
I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't prepare in advance.
Now here's where we are.
So okay, well, what are you gonna do about it?
And I said, okay, I need your help.
What should I do about it?
Cause I really didn't know.
And at that point he came in, explained it to me, explained how to get myself out of the situation that I had created.
And then that was it, we moved on.
And so to have a leader who's kind of willing to have that level of patience and that level of, if his boss had walked in that day, he would have been in as much trouble as I was, but he was seasoning up in his career to let me make my own mistake and then learn from it and then do better going forward.

Christine Laperriere:
It's such a brilliant example.
You know, so many people talk about developing people and letting them fail and things like that.
But I just feel again, you know, to me the magic is what does that look like?
Because there's a lot of people that wouldn't have let you fail.
At 11 o'clock at night, he would have said, give it to me, I'm gonna do it myself.
You're not competent enough.

Maureen Cawley:
Right, and having a leader who's willing to sort of have skin in the game with you and give you the space to fail, knowing that they would share in that failure and they're built up enough in their own career that it doesn't scare them.
And I think that's what makes a good leader is having that willingness to say, I can be a buffer for my team, I can let them learn.
It's the insecure leaders who say, no, no, no, I have to micromanage your success because your success is a reflection of my success and I can't afford to have a mistake here.
Right, so I'm sure moving forward though, you had such a big learning from that experience.
What happened next?
I started, eventually I started getting good at my job.
So I went from kind of taking whatever was expected that I needed to do and sort of glossing over it and saying, okay, I kind of get it, I'm fumbling through to actually taking the time to sit down, read it, thoroughly understand it.
What I don't understand, ask a question, prepare in advance.
It's like they say in college, right?
If you read the syllabus, you'll be fine.
Starting my career, I wasn't doing a very good job of that.
Having that key lesson to slow down, don't read the instructions before you go forward, have a plan before you move.
That's a lesson that's stuck with me this whole time.

Christine Laperriere:
And it sounds like the ability to even ask the questions to get the right clarity and know what you don't know and know what you know.

Maureen Cawley:
It's a big thing.
You see that now, even as I grow in my career, the smartest leaders are the ones who are willing to raise their hand and say, hey, I don't understand what you just said.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's true that especially coming in new, it can be hard to have the courage to admit that.
So in this case, I mean, you went ahead and lived an example of it.
And then he gave you a chance to reflect back on that and go, okay, I'm not gonna do that again.
What other examples can you think of as you were working alongside him?
What were the things you really admired?

Maureen Cawley:
I think this wouldn't be surprising is that because of the way Max developed people, he had a huge network.
And so even now, like a couple of years ago, he reached out to me, he was working on something.
I brought him into a networking group that I was a part of.
And I'm one of dozens, if not hundreds of people who would see the phone ringing after years with his number on it and say, oh, hey, it's Max and have like a warm feeling.
And if he asked for something, anybody who's worked with them in the past would be more than happy to provide whatever it is, whether it's a quick question or a resource or a connection and he would do the same.
So that's, again, I think that comes from having a confidence in your own leadership and your own abilities so that it's easy for you to extend kind of whether it's, yeah, extend yourself, I guess, for other people, because you're not worried about what it would cost you.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
That is such an amazing type of relationship builder.
And it came up in a different show too, where, I always say like the ones who you feel kind of naturally indebted to, you never stop feeling indebted to them.
Like when they gave you so much, I can think of an example of a great leader that I worked with who was so kind when I went through this concussion.
And I was just saying eight years later, like if he calls, it's like, how high do you want me to jump?
He's just got years of deep loyalty for me.
So it's neat when you have that type of feeling for somebody.

Maureen Cawley:
I agree.
And I think that's what makes a best boss in a lot of cases is because what the expression people use, right, you'll run through walls for that person.
So when you have a leader who's building teams of people who really feel like they're doing great work and feel like their boss is there to support them, not to kind of climb over them, then the business itself, whatever business that is, will function better because people are just honest about doing their best work.
There's no politicizing.
There's no kind of zero sum game.
We all have a chance to do our best.
And then you have some vested interest in making your boss feel proud or happy with the work that you're doing.

Christine Laperriere:
And I think it's cool.
I mean, you'll run through walls.
And I'm thinking in the back of my head, you're still running through walls for him, which is a pretty cool treat.
It's not even just when you work for him.
It's like, that's what that network looks like.

Maureen Cawley:
Right, exactly.
And I love that too, to feed the network.
When you have strong leaders or best bosses in your network and you can help connect them, it helps you in the long run because then you become a builder yourself.

Christine Laperriere:
So out of curiosity, any other leaders that come to mind when you think of that example of best boss, anyone else that kind of caught you on that list?

Maureen Cawley:
I thought about it, I have sort of two.
So Max was my first boss.
He really set me up with a strong foundation.
And then there was a sort of what got you here, won't get you there moment in my career.
Several years ago, I had a boss, her name was Anna.
And I started to get feedback that I was doing a good job with execution, but I needed to be strategic.
I don't know if you've ever gotten that feedback before that you need to be strategic.
And then you say, well, what does that mean?
And you hear a whole bunch of jargon that you can't action on.
This woman, her name's Anna, she said to me, let me tell you what it means to be strategic.
You need to think six months ahead, that's it.
If you think six months ahead, I promise you will stop getting feedback that you need to be more strategic.
That has been worth its weight in gold.
And she was absolutely right.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a brilliant way to boil it down.
So I do a huge amount of coaching with female leaders and there's often exactly what you said, like mid-career, there's this moment where we're still waiting for permission to be invited to be the strategic thinker.
And if we don't start to demonstrate the strategic thinking, the world's not gonna look at us and say, hey, I could picture that person as a VP or a chief officer.
And so there's that moment where execution is what got us really strong accolades out of the gate, but then mid-career, it starts to stall out a little.
And so I love when I hear that because so many people go through that transition.
And to your point, they're not given anything useful that they can quickly grab onto.

Maureen Cawley:
Right, or give me an example of what you're looking for.
Help me understand.
And I'm lucky because I'm in HR, which lends itself to thinking six months ahead.
Because I remember the first time I had a chance to apply it, we were in the annual review cycle.
And so essentially all I had to do to start being strategic was start asking, oh, and what do you hope that this person accomplishes by the mid-year review?
Or by this time next year, how big do you think this department will be?
It's not even hard if you break it down into that think six months ahead timeframe.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it.
I actually think that's such a helpful tip for so many people that are listening right now who have probably been given similar feedback.

Maureen Cawley:
Yeah, it's a stumbling block for a lot of people.
And I think it's an easy piece of feedback to put to somebody.
It's like, oh, you need to be more strategic.
I can't lean on you as a strategic partner.
Okay, but what are you looking for?
And so I always think, okay, if we're trying to be strategic here, there's a tactical way to be strategic, which is take out the calendar and work backwards from your goals.
And that's called a strategy to get there.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that is brilliant.
So that was Anna.
I think that sounds like, again, like a really game-changing piece of advice she gave you.

Maureen Cawley:
Totally game-changing.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And what would you say in your experience have you learned from your not great leaders?
Like you don't have to name them, but like when you think of people that sometimes you see somebody do something and you go, I'm gonna make sure I never do that.

Maureen Cawley:
Yeah, I do a fair amount of yoga.
And in yoga they say, if there's somebody who is giving you a particularly hard time, you have to ask what they're there to teach you.
And so if you take that question, like I don't know that I've ever had like a bad boss or somebody that I would explain that way, but I've certainly had frustrations.
And so when I look back on those now, I think the biggest takeaway that I've gotten from those experiences was you have to stop working for your boss and start working for yourself and focus on your work and what you accomplish instead of working for the praise or the acceptance or the feedback from somebody else.
You have to let the work serve that purpose for you.

Christine Laperriere:
Again, I think that's a really big nugget because it is frustrating when we can't get the accolades from somebody.
And a lot of people do feel really stuck.
Like if they can't get the accolades, then what?

Maureen Cawley:
I mean, for me, at this point in my career, I work for my work and I like to, like my current job I'm building an HR department.
So it's very gratifying year over year to see the progress.
And I'm very fortunate because I have a great boss now and I have a great team that I work with.
But if I set that to the side, the thing that I really work for is my resume.
And I look at it as if I can make accomplishments and I can make my workplace better and I can make my department stronger, that just builds to my book of experience.
And it also is recognized by my leadership team, recognized by my boss, which I appreciate and I value, but I have to put that part second.
Like I have to work for the work and then let the recognition come instead of working to try to be recognized and then not stopping to sort of recognize myself what's being accomplished.
You know, only a bad boss can really teach you that.
Don't look here, look at what's in front of you.
Don't look to that person specifically.
Would you say in a way, the way you're thinking of it helps you stay authentic?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
I'm not sure.
It's just that interesting.
I think it is hard.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, that's, I guess what I'm thinking is like, you know, do you then, you know, are you now chasing something that you feel is important for the business?
It's important for what you think you're capable of.
And the accolades are just a second, you know, that's the icing on the cake.

Maureen Cawley:
Right, I guess that's right.
It's a different North star.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Maureen Cawley:
And I think it's a truer North than somebody else's feelings about you or your work.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's a really good way of putting it because again, I do know, I coach people where they get that frustration, where they can't get that accolade from their boss and they can't get that feeling.
And they've had it before.
They've had recognition before.
So once you take away recognition, it starts to feel really disengaging.
It is hard to work with somebody that feels that way.
You know, so to your point, the idea of putting the North star somewhere else that gets you back in alignment with your strength and who you are, sounds like a healthy way to pivot.

Maureen Cawley:
Yeah, and bosses can change.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Maureen Cawley:
So if you're ever in an organization and you feel like, oh, your boss is so frustrating, your boss is so frustrating, maybe they're on their way out.
Maybe they're doing their own job search or maybe they're not.
And maybe you're about to get a really great phone call about something.
So in either circumstance, the best defense is to be prepared with what you bring that you know is objectively valuable, not subject to somebody else's point of view.
That's great advice.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's great advice.
So one of the questions I love to ask people because, and I think even given your role, you'll appreciate this question, but I work with top talent and everybody asks, what's the return on investment?
And so I love to know when you think of, it's always the hardest question.
What is the impact to the bottom line of working for a best boss?
Why should we care if you have best bosses or not?

Maureen Cawley:
Well, turnover is expensive.
So first and foremost, right?
So if you are thinking about what it costs in terms of recruiting fees, what it costs in terms of training.
So any skilled professional takes at least six months to get up to speed.
So you can imagine half a year's wages are being invested every time you have to hire somebody new because you have someone in place who's not a great leader and not retaining their talent.
On top of that, there's the less quantifiable but very important impact of the alumni network of your company.
And you want the alumni network to be feeling positively about the organization.
Maybe they were trained really well.
Maybe they're still in touch with their old boss.
You don't want a team that is skilled and can't leave.
You want some turnover, obviously.
You wanna see people move on and grow.
But what you want is a fond affinity for your company because that's your employer brand.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that you say that.
I don't hear a lot of people reminding each other about the importance of how people feel when they leave is important.

Maureen Cawley:
Especially in this remote environment, right?
So I think a lot of times we forget that just because somebody has left our organization doesn't mean they've left our social circles.
Doesn't mean they're not still friends.
Doesn't mean that they're not just on a different Slack channel with your team.
So to be sort of negligent as people are leaving or not thinking about how alumni feel could be a pretty big mistake.
And that's where a boss has such a primary impact on how people feel about the company.
And that's why it's the company's responsibility to make sure that if someone's lacking leadership skills, we have to help build it for them.
And there's accountability too that goes into that, right?
So I've had jobs where the sales structure, for example, the incentive was purely based on what you bring in.
Nothing to do with how you manage your team or how you interact with others.
So you have to put a value on what you expect.
And so if you expect good leadership, you have to incorporate that into reviews.
There has to be a financial reward or consequence.
Yeah, and if you incentivize your leaders to be good leaders, you'll certainly see some positive return, whether it's in retention or the performance of the team, there'll be something there.

Christine Laperriere:
That's such a good point because again, these are the things that, like you said, they're not measurable.
But even when you say that, I can think of an organization I worked with that had a very good reputation as being a great place to work.
And the leader there, he could pick up the phone and hired the best talent in the financial industry in downtown Toronto.
And like every time we'd lose somebody or there's something that would happen, I mean, I just was always amazed.
He was probably similar to Max.
I don't know if he was probably the best boss, but he had a very good network and that business had a very good brand of being a great place to work.
I genuinely enjoyed working with him as a client.
And it's just very interesting that he was able to pick up the phone and poach people from anywhere.

Maureen Cawley:
Well, it's interesting.
I work with a leader today who's a fantastic partner and one of his hiring criteria when he looks to hire anybody manager level and above is who can you bring with you?
Because you want the kind of leaders who have a following and that has been, and we've seen it play out where there have been referrals made by people that we bring in and that just strengthens the team.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, yeah.
Now all of a sudden you're not bringing one talented individual, you're bringing many or a few.

Maureen Cawley:
And you sort of weed out maybe candidates who are bouncing around and they don't have a strong network or they haven't cultivated relationships.
And if they haven't cultivated relationships before, they probably won't do it here.
So we're asking upfront about the network of your candidate can be pretty helpful.

Christine Laperriere:
That's an interesting one.
I really like that.
Excellent.
So just as we kind of summarize some of this, if you had some real, I mean, you had so many nuggets and great words of wisdom.
So I don't know if this is putting you on the spot, but there's leaders that are listening to the show right now and they're aspiring to be best bosses.
They probably already are if they're listening to the show in the first place, but they're on their way, right?
So what would be some of the wisdom that you would impart to them, as we kind of wrap this session up?

Maureen Cawley:
To be a great leader, you have to keep the focus on your team and you invest in them and you put them first.
It comes back to you without you having to press for your own needs.

Christine Laperriere:
It's kind of one of those, the reciprocation will just happen on its own.

Maureen Cawley:
Exactly, exactly.
But it has to start with giving and putting your focus in the right place.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I just heard somebody use the phrase earlier today, what you put into the universe, you get back.
And they were using it in response to a great leader.
And I thought, what an interesting, and I think so many of us spiritually can feel that.
That makes sense to us.
And I feel like you're almost highlighting that in a way.
It's like what you put into your team, you'll get back.
What you put into the business, you'll get back.

Maureen Cawley:
And if not in the short term, in the long term, you certainly will.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, so you just put it in, don't worry so much.
Let the math happen on its own.

Maureen Cawley:
Easier said than done most of the time, but yeah, I think so.

Christine Laperriere:
Lovely.
Maureen, thank you so much.
This has been such a fun interview.
I really appreciate it.

Maureen Cawley:
Thank you so much, Christine.
I've really enjoyed talking with you.

Guest: Stephen Tomicki

Christine Laperriere:
And today I have a gentleman by the name of Steven on the show.
What I'm really excited about is that I have been answering some of the great outreach that I've gotten on LinkedIn where people have said, hey, wait a minute, I have a best boss and I wanna talk about them.
And so Steven is one of those cases.
So Steven, please introduce yourself.

Stephen Tomicki:
Thank you for taking the time.
My name is Steven Tomicki.
I live in New Jersey.
I have a master's degree for international business as well as an engineering degree from Villanova University, Go Cats.
Diehard Eagles fan, so I'm excited about this weekend.
I've been in the construction, engineering, environmental business on all four sides of the fence, meaning that I've been in the trenches, I've been in the boardroom, I've been an owner of an engineering firm, and then I've been on the project management side, managing staff and also being one of the Indians, so to speak.
That's me in a nutshell, glad to be here.
Thank you, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great.
And so I'm just gonna dive in with the question that I'm excited to ask you.
Can you think of who your best boss ever is?
Tell us a little bit more about why you think of him that way.

Stephen Tomicki:
Well, it's interesting.
I said, okay, let me go back to when I started working when I was 12 years old, how I started working.
And I think the big thing when we were younger, and it was just a way of life back then, things were different, at least that's what I thought.
So in my teens going into even my 20s, nobody really appreciated anything.
You did your job, nobody said you did a great job, at least for me.
I didn't get any positive reinforcement, it was only negative reinforcement.
There was no such thing as a team player, although as I was part of the team, there was always a good camaraderie.
And I blame my parents for that, for teaching me and bringing me up, right being the oldest of five.
And then as I transitioned, I went to school, engineering, had a lot of job offers when I got out of school.
So I was kind of like picking and choosing where my personality fits.
I did a lot back then to make sure I was choosing the right career path.
And along the way, there was a number of speed bumps with the wrong bosses, the wrong companies, being mistreated, people having tunnel vision, unwilling to listen to ideas from the snot-nosed kid, graduate in engineering school, who might have a good idea.
And this goes on.
So as I thought about the question when I originally saw it on LinkedIn, I was like, hmm, what makes my current boss the best boss ever?
Well, he calls me every day and asks me how I'm doing.
And that was before I had a cancer diagnosis and started chemotherapy back in August.

Christine Laperriere:
So he's always called you every day and asked you how you're doing.
Yeah, now it's just more often.
He says, are you sure?
I'm like, Rob, ask me one question and I'll give you one answer.
Ask me again and I'm gonna give you the same answer unless you have like a couple hour delay, you know?
And the company I work for has allowed me to work from home, even though my office is a half hour away.
And he's the one who said, you know what?
You can do the same thing from home.
We just will miss him in the office.
So, you know, some of the things that I mentioned were they're not bullies.
The reason I worked there is because he had a heart attack and was out for quite a while.
And the company ownership, which is a 40 year old family owned company, one of my friends is one of the owners and he called up and said, oh, what are you doing?
Can you talk to us?
I need some help.
And I was babysitting a job site out in Council Bluff, Iowa.
And I said, all right, well, yeah, I'll come in when I come back and I did.
And long story short, there may be an offer I couldn't refuse, but I was replacing him and two other people.
And I was really thrown into the fire.
And, you know, after a couple of weeks of recovering, he started to call me every day.
And the support was, you know, it was great, but I was doing most of the support as well.
So, you know, we created a teamwork environment and I changed a lot of the processes that were there.
And instead of him saying, when he got back saying, yeah, we don't do things this way.
It needs to go back the other way.
He didn't do that.
He goes, oh, these are great ideas.
We'll implement them.
So that was unique.
He's always willing to listen.
In the past, a lot of my bosses, presidents of companies, co-ownership, they bully you.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Stephen Tomicki:
Whether it be a political thing, you know, one of the things that my wife was mentioning earlier from a previous job is that my boss, who wasn't doing too well with the team, decided that he was going to take the project that I had won with a very large beverage company, which was worth millions of dollars, and give it to someone else's credit and took it away from me.
Yeah, that relationship didn't last much longer.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Stephen Tomicki:
But, you know, because of political pressure inside of the company, that person who he had a 10-year relationship with, it went to the political side as compared to my two- or three-year relationship, which is, you know, I know companies have it, Christine.
It was really sad to be on the receiving end of that.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it hurts, right?

Stephen Tomicki:
Yeah, and it's unjustified, you know.
But, you know, lesson learned there, I would never do that to anybody.
You know, creating a team environment for my current boss has always created a team environment, both as camaraderie with the guys in the field or the people in the office, but he also fosters that between the two of us.
You know, we'll sit down and have a meeting about a project, and it'll go an hour.
Where, should it be less?
Probably not, because we discuss a lot of the ideas that we have about, okay, let's not just discuss the project today, let's talk about it two weeks down the road.
I have a very unique project management style.
I work from the rear end of a project to the front end.
So I talk about caveats and what can go wrong, and if we go over, are we responsible for liquidated damages, et cetera?
And that was one of the philosophies that I changed internally that everybody understands, okay, where's our risk?
And a lot of them, a lot of people don't generally, they don't perceive risk, they just do what they're supposed to do and hope for the best, where I'm one of those people that I wanna know where my risk is coming from and how I can either get rid of it or understand it.
That was something that it was awesome for him to understand and take ownership together with me the way that I do that.
So that was nice.

Christine Laperriere:
He appreciates the diversity of thought versus rejects it.
So can I, if it's up to you, if it's too emotional, but I'm just curious, can you walk me through the experience of, obviously you started to recognize something was wrong and then you went through this cancer diagnosis.
What did the conversation look like with your boss through that entire process?

Stephen Tomicki:
Well, I was diagnosed with cancer in 2017.
Okay.
I had a mediation thing and it was fine for a couple of years.
And they decided that they needed to start giving me light chemo with pills just to keep it at bay.
It's prostate cancer.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.

Stephen Tomicki:
And then after a couple of years, that was working well.
And then all of a sudden in this August of this year, last year, I'm sorry, it was kind of like a three-day horrible experience that I ended up in the hospital.
When I told them I was going, he goes, and you're okay.
It's like, I'll let you know.
And he started texting me knowing that he didn't wanna call me.
And I told him the next day and I was in the hospital for five days.
And then when I got out and I told him I was gonna get some testing done to find out why this happened, I didn't tell him my cancer was back.
At that point, we didn't know.
Just thought it might've been, I don't know, a kidney stone, something like that.
So next week I went through the testing and then that's when I told him over the phone because I wasn't allowed to be around anybody because my white cells were like zero.
So yeah, he was like, all right, what do you need from us?

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
What do you need from us?
Yeah.
So he never once was trying to figure out how you're gonna work, what he's gonna do.
Like, no, it's just what do you need from us?

Stephen Tomicki:
No, and him, my colleagues, the owners, they're constantly, they send me food.
They sent me fruit.
They sent this gift card to go to get like DoorDash.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
You know, get well soon.
We miss you and don't eat too much.
You know, and I did lose 50 pounds going through this.
So now they call me Skinny Steve.
So it's pretty funny.
Some of the other things that I worked on him together with is, and some of the things that I had actually talked to him about in the past that I kind of was kidding and I gave him a warning.
You know, like, don't ever do this to me.
And it was more like a conversation we're having now.
And I was like, yeah, I've had some bad experiences.
Just want to let you know that I won't tolerate that anymore.
And he goes, well, what are you gonna do?
I said, probably I don't have really a temper, but I probably wouldn't like it.
And he goes, well, that's nice.
I said, yeah, you know, I'm 6'1", at that point, 270 pounds and the poor guy is 10 years younger than I am.
And he was just coming out of being sick.
He had lost some weight.
So he was a shadow of his former self.
So that was an interesting conversation.
You know, one of the things that I really enjoy about it is when he makes a mistake or when the team makes a mistake.
I learned this a long time ago.
It's a lesson learned experience as compared to a shouting match or why did you do that?
Or you're fired or, you know, it's just who he is.
And it's who I am too.
You know, why would he yell at somebody?
Although one of our kids, I'm sure, would have a different opinion, you know, but the other thing is he's willing to learn from me and he's willing to learn from others.
So if there's a different way of doing something, you know, he'll be more than happy to give you his opinion.
Like, I don't think that's a good idea or that's a really good idea.
Probably the most, I don't expect somebody to pat me on the back and say I did a really good job or I did a good job or that was a great idea.
I don't need that.
You know, I know who I am.
I'm 63 years old.
At this point, I know how good I am.
I have a pretty good self-esteem as you can tell.

Christine Laperriere:
So, but when you get that, it's amazing.
That's amazing.
And it's pretty amazing when you feel so touched by their response to you getting sick that it's emotional.
Like that's pretty special given that not many people can say that they feel that from, you know, they feel that maybe from their spouses and their family and their friends, but it's very rare that people say, well, gosh, you know, the place that I work at, you know, it brings me to tears when I think of the way they've loved and supported me through this.

Stephen Tomicki:
You know, my wife and I were talking yesterday.
I said, you know what, you know, I'm like three years and change away from like full retirement age.
What if I told them in a year or two that, listen, remember when I was sick and I worked from home?
Well, how about if I work from home from Florida or North Carolina or South Carolina?
Can I do the same thing?
She says, well, what do you think they'd say?
I was like, well, I think they'd say sure why.
And that's what explanation, but it wouldn't be, I know you're out of your mind.
You have to sit in your seat.
You know, it's, I think we've learned a lot, not only through COVID with people working from home, although our company didn't close.
We just had two thirds of the staff working from home and then the one third would come in and then the other one third would rotate out and come back in.
They did a really good job with the COVID thing.
So like working from home was not new to them, but I think working from home had COVID not happened, it would have possibly been different for them, how they would feel about somebody working from home all the time, seven days a week, you know.
And I'm just blessed that throughout this treatment time that I've been able to get through chemotherapy and still work almost every day.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, you're right, because they've created that flexible environment for you so you can keep yourself healthy.
You know, like you said, you gotta make sure you stay away from the germs right now, but also being able to get up and contribute in an environment that's not toxic, but is a healthy environment for you to show up to is also a healthy part of recovering from a difficult illness.
You know, like that's what you're going through would probably be harder if you weren't able to go contribute and add value to something important.

Stephen Tomicki:
Yeah, my wife says that all the time.
If I couldn't work or I couldn't contribute as much as I do, which is probably way too much.
There's times that, you know, I get out of my seat.
I start, you know, working at, you know, six o'clock in the morning.
Sometimes I don't stop until seven at night.
Not too often since I've been sick, but there's times that I feel really good that I've been able to do that.
And I get yelled at by this same gentleman.
Like, what are you doing?
Like, well, I'm able to work today so if we're gonna do it, you know, maybe tomorrow I'll take a longer lunch.
You know, do that.
So it's nice.
But, you know, some of the things that I learned in my 20s, I had some horrible bosses, bullies, people that would fight.
They would curse and yell and scream at you.
There was no positive reinforcement.
It was all negative.

Christine Laperriere:
Why do you think that was?
If you look back over the years of your career, what is it about that environment that, why did that work?
Why was that even sustainable?
Today, that sounds crazy, but I know, because I lived in that work environment too.
Like, why do you think that was?

Stephen Tomicki:
You know, I thought about that.
Like, was it my fault that it was either one?
I'm like, no, there's other people that he treats just as poorly.
I guess that, I'll blame it on poor parenting.
You know, you think about, and I knew him pretty well.
I worked there for quite a long time.
The only thing I can think of is he learned that from somebody, somehow, some environment that he thought it was a-okay to treat people like that.
And he treated everybody like that, from his au pair to his ex-wife, to his little child always yelling at him, put away your clothes, put this, put that, you know.
So he was just a nasty man.
And, you know, I was there for way too long, Christine, but did I gain a thicker skin from it?
I don't know if thicker skin is the right term, but I did gain a conscience of, I will never put up with this again.
And I had not, had not.
But the other thing is, you know, coming out of my 20s, going to my 30s and 40s, I didn't realize what a political environment was in a company, because at that point, I really hadn't been exposed to a heavy political environment, you know, or the backstabbing, or talking behind your back, or taking credit for things that you did, and somebody else would take credit for it.
It was like a bad Lifetime movie at times.
Some of the things, they were just, along the way, unwilling to listen.
It was their way or the highway.
You know, it was just not a comfortable environment.
But again, if you want to survive in that particular arena back then, you had to deal with it, you know, keep your head down, go onward.
That's one of my favorite expressions, onward.
I use it a lot, especially now.
I do have a couple of favorite expressions.

Christine Laperriere:
Do share, do share.

Stephen Tomicki:
Careful of the toes you step on today.
It might belong to the butt you have to kiss tomorrow.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.

Stephen Tomicki:
Yeah, that's one of my favorites.
I've taught that to my kids.
It's never, this is one of my favorites, and people don't understand what this means, generally.
It's never what is.
It's only what's perceived.
So if you thought you did a really good job, and your client, your customer, your boss, your company, or anybody else that you work with thinks you don't, it's, you know, it's not a screaming match that says, you know, how wrong you are.
It's like, look, they perceive it as, you know, not a good thing.
And even though you think it is, doesn't really matter, what you think, it's what's, who perceives it.
Oh, if you think you did really good at your job, and your numbers are up in sales, and your customers like you, and your boss comes in and says, listen, I talked to a bunch of your customers.
They don't like you.
What makes you think that your customers like you?
I don't know.
I kind of thought I was doing a good job.
They don't perceive that.
And I stole that perception.
They don't perceive that.
So I said, all right, well, it's never what I think, or never what is.
It's only what they perceive.
That's really helped a lot.

Christine Laperriere:
It helps you not kind of like over count your own perspective against those of those around you.
Right?
It's like, it's a smart way to keep in mind that it's multiple perspectives that kind of make up reality.

Stephen Tomicki:
Right?
Which goes back to that lesson learned philosophy.
If people don't think they made a mistake, and you're going to use it as a lesson learned opportunity to say, look, all right, you screwed up.
You messed up.
You made a mistake.
No big deal.
All right.
Let's find out why.
And is it my fault?
Did I not teach you right?
Did we not teach you right?
Where's the shortcoming here on our side?
What could we do better?
And you want to talk about change in the perception.
When people go into those meetings or they hear you on the phone, they're like, rutt rutt, a little scooby doo, right?
Rutt rutt in trouble.
And 10, 20, 30 seconds into the conversation, it's like, wow, I didn't think that was coming.
They're asking me for what I thought and how it could be avoided going into next time.
And it's an open conversation as compared to a beration or a demerit.
You know, going back to that Steve McQueen movie a long time ago, you know, a dink for being, you know, that's not how it works.
You know, if you talk to some of the people in our company and some of the companies I've worked for in the past, you know, who's our worst employee?
Well, I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
But some people would answer that very differently.
Oh, it's Jack.
He's, you know, he keeps doing this, you know, and that's a shame that that happens.
And then in an instance when I was working for quite a long time, I went and talked to Jack and I said, dude, what's going on?
You know, why do you keep doing that?
He goes, oh, I have bad hands.
And every once in a while when I'm holding something, my hands just go.
I'm like, oh, have you had anybody take a look at it?
I'm like, no.
I said, he keeps dropping stuff on his feet and, you know, broke a toe, broke a metatarsal.
And it's happened three times in two years.
I'm like, okay.
So now I know.
So as an owner of the company back at that, I came back and I said, look, Jack needs help with his hands.
And they said, well, what do you think we should do?
I said, tell him not to pick up anything over 20 pounds.
And I don't think it would be a problem, not a 45 pound manhole cover.
You know, but had I not done that, had I not realized that they perceive him as a problem child, if you will, and a liability.
And now we know why, but no one's ever asked on that.
They just say, oh, you keep your cluts or you keep doing that.
Or, you know, there was no understanding why it happened.
I think understanding that people are going to make mistakes for humans and lesson learns, understanding perception, teamwork environment, the things like that that I foster.
And then you're gonna, probably the next question, you're gonna say, okay, what's your worst trait?
You know, am I, this comes up a lot, you know, too nice.
I'm not the jerk.
I don't know when to put my foot down.
I certainly pull the rip cord, but I don't know when to put my foot down.
And then there's a difference as we know.
And that's a fine line to understand.
Pulling the rip cord is really understanding, you know, when do I need help?
And when do I realize I'm in trouble, that it's too late or just about to?
And, you know, again, lesson learned, how do you preemptively make sure that that doesn't happen again?
Well, we all know why.
Just understand your process from the beginning and realize that if there is risk, is it your fault for risk?
Is it someone else's?
It's do things come up that you need to understand that you don't, but you think you do?
Ask for help.
And I think that's where my current boss and the people that I'm surrounded with, they always ask questions.
We always ask and challenge each other.
A great example is we're doing a project where we have a lot of concrete that needs to be repaired.
And we said, okay, that's cosmetically making sure it's stable on the outside.
But how do we fix to make sure that two years down the road, three years down the road, that there's not a problem and it doesn't come back on us because we did the work, even though at that particular point we're going to say, okay, it's a foot below the work we did.
So we decided to talk to our client about risk versus reward for them.
Do we spend the extra time and money to make sure that the concrete is in good condition a foot below as compared to just on the surface that we did some cosmetic repairs.
And that conversation went well.
But again, going back to the end of a project, it's not when you finish work.
It's years down the road since your name, your company's name is on that project, no one's going to remember, oh, you only did the cosmetic work.
You didn't do the other concrete work that should have been done.
It's our fault.
So I think that's where my experience has come in that you got to think down the road where you, and of course documenting everything is another whole thing that I brought there that everybody was documenting things on their dailies or casual conversations.
So we created a number of things internally, at least for me, that I would document everything through email.
And it's searchable as compared to a text or a picture or a piece of paper in the paper file.
So it's, again, lessons learned over 30, 40 years of document everything.
As I'm getting older, there's a couple of reasons for that.
First thing that goes when you get older, your memory.
And the second one is, and the third one is.
Yeah, call me when you remember, right?
I just think that the communication, lesson learned philosophy, listening to ideas, spitballing, as they say, big one for me with everything else combined is it's a non-judgmental atmosphere.
Nobody says that's a stupid idea, you idiot.
And I don't ever expect I'd hear that.
That's really nice.
And that's throughout the 40-year-old company.
But maybe that's why we all get along.
Good listener, flexible, even before I got sick.
The support was there.
He's not a bully.
He never says I'm the smartest guy in the room.
He doesn't act like that.
He's technically oriented, but he doesn't throw up all over you with everything he knows, which is one of the most annoying things ever.

Christine Laperriere:
I think it's amazing.
And I think given what you're going through, I feel like that tells even a deeper level around the commitment and the character of the people around you because it's not just sunny days, right?
It's like there's dark days and there's reasons why I'm sure it's inconvenient for you to be sick.
And it's not, you know, obviously you're, you know, you matter.
And so they'd like you to come back.
But, you know, in the meantime, they're struggling because your work is not being done, you know, at the same level.
And so it just speaks so much to how they respond to that.
I've shared a story before where I went through a concussion and I had two different leaders I was working with.
One who, you know, dragged me out of bed for a 5 a.m.
call because he was working in Germany and then berated me because there was something wrong with the slide deck.
And I was mid-concussion and going, I don't even know what my name is right now.
So like, this is really frustrating.
And he knew it.
I had already asked to move the meeting, but it was, you know, to him, it was like, we need this project done.
And then the second leader who I spoke with that day, right around that time, I said, I just suffered a concussion and I'm, you know, I'm having a rough week.
And he actually said, I want you to invoice me right now.
The last thing I want you to worry about is money.
Like, I want you to take as long as you need, get fully better, and we'll just make it up down the road.
And just the, the, the you first, like, you know, genuinely, his highest priority was making sure that I was healthy.
And then secondary, it was getting the project done that we were working on together.
But for him to just be so conscious of that human element, it spoke volumes, right?
And it was so interesting because it wasn't, it sounds like common sense, but then meanwhile, I literally got on a call with somebody who woke me up, you know, who said, well, the only time convenient for me is 5 a.m.
your time.
And then I'm on a call at 5 a.m.
And, you know, something was wrong with the slide deck.
And he just decided that that was going to be a 20 minute berating concussion and all.
It just didn't matter, you know?
And I was like, this is really so interesting to have these two very vast different experiences.

Stephen Tomicki:
And I, I've had Christine, and I'm sure you have too, we've had really good positive experiences in our career, and we will have other positive experiences.
But I think we remember the negative ones more, whether it be due to lack of understanding or while I came out of left field, I don't know where that expression came from, but, you know, it's like, wow, where the heck did that come from?
When those surprises happen, I want to dive into it.
One of the other expressions I use is, post-mortem doesn't mean after death.
It just means after you're all done, whether you made mistakes, made the profit you're supposed to make, or the client was happy, you have to deal with the positives and the negatives, the goods, the bads, the, wow, we could have made a lot more money over there if we had done this.
So it's, you know, like the end scenario.
If we did this and we did that, other people, when you say you're going to do post-mortem, you're like, you know, at the end of a project, they're going to actually talk about the project being, you know, how you created death, you know, and it's amazing that people view things differently.
If you look up, talk to different age groups, different experiences, and you say I'm going to do a post-mortem with you, they get all frazzled.
They're like, well, what's that?
Or there, this goes back to that perception word again.
What do they perceive as a post-mortem?
All right, in the past, people are going to get laid.
Heads are going to roll.
Fingers are going to be pointed, right?
Post-mortem.
It's not like that from my career in the last, I don't know, 20 years.
It's been a, okay, we did well here.
We didn't do well here.
Let's see if there's any SOP, standard operating procedure.
If there's an SOP that needs to be revised, changed, added, deleted, you know, or process that needs to be updated.
Let's do it.
Let's understand.
A lot of people don't.
They just want to know, okay, we were supposed to make 32% profit, we only made 21.
All right, tell me why.
And that's it.
Okay, great.
Off the call.
I've been on calls like that.
When you get off the call, I'm like, they don't want to hear anything else?
I'm like, okay, short-sighted.
Stole ideas and took credit for it themselves and didn't give you credit for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Idea thieves, they're all over the place.
I was just in a conversation not that long ago with somebody who was taking quite a bit of credit for something.
And I was just reminded.
I was reminded that it had been a while since I went through that and how wildly frustrating it is to sit on a call and have somebody brag about their great idea that you had been championing for much longer than they've even been in the role.

Stephen Tomicki:
Yeah, and the beauty of all this, even before I got sick, I don't worry about that now.
I've been here two and a half years and I don't worry about spewing my ideas and being you're an idiot or where you get that idea from.
Go back to the ice cream parlor and write it down on a napkin and throw it away.
Again, some of the expressions that people have thrown at me, that's not a good idea.
But go back to the ice cream parlor with the five-year-olds, write it down on a napkin and throw the napkin away next time you have an idea like that.

Christine Laperriere:
I've never heard that before.

Stephen Tomicki:
Well, you've got to consider the source.

Christine Laperriere:
That one wins top condescending statement of, you know.

Stephen Tomicki:
Go back to the ice cream parlor, sit down with the five-year-olds, write it down on a napkin and throw it away.
Next time you have an idea like that, go back and do the exact same thing.
I don't want to hear it in my call.

Christine Laperriere:
That one's, that's pretty bad.
So just as we come to close, Steven, is there a kind of words or wisdom?
I have a lot of leaders that are out there trying to be the best that they can.
I think you've shared a ton of insight.
I also think I hope we've really inspired some people to think about how you show up for your employees.
First of all, before something happens, right?
Before, you know, a life catastrophe comes your way.
But I love that it sounds like you didn't have to worry about being supported in that moment.
You kind of knew you were going to be supported and then they just blew you away with all the extra love and support they brought to the table that you didn't even expect.
I think that's an incredible testament right there for leadership.

Stephen Tomicki:
I think for leadership or whether you're, you know, at the Elon Musk level, not that they would care at that level or at my level or other people's level, I think that what we had talked about a little bit ago, it's not what is.
It's what's perceived.
So if you're thinking you're doing a good job with the people, you think you're managing them correctly as a boss, as a leader, you think, all right, let's hit the five top points.
Am I leading by example?
Yes.
Are my people doing well?
Yes.
Are they showing up for work and not taking every single day?
That's another pet peeve of mine.
Every single day that they're entitled to.
Are they doing that or are they really working hard?
Do they really understand what I expect of them?
Of course they do.
And do I talk to my people on a regular basis and I don't berate them.
I don't treat them as small.
I don't do that.
So if I do all those five things, but my staff, my team, they don't think I'm like that?
Well, how do you figure that out?
I think that's the biggest challenge as a leader is you think you're doing a good job and that goes back to that one of my favorite expressions.
It's not what is.
It's what's perceived.
How do you figure out what that perception is?
And if you do figure it out, how do you do a course correction?
Well, a couple of the tools we have in our toolbox is the lesson learned thing.
Talk to them as human being.
Sit down with them individually.
Don't talk to them in an open environment that, goodness, another one of those expressions.
The ambiguity of the written word.
The tone of an email and be misconstrued.
Sure, we know that because we communicate by email.
I think that's the toughest thing as a leader.
Whether you think you're doing a good job or not, your bosses, do they understand you?
Do they support you?
Do they really understand what your job is?
And you understand what your job is and is to perception both ways going up as it is going down to your staff, your support team.
I think that's the hardest thing.
For any leader, I think in the mid-level and maybe upper-level environment, I don't know if it would go all the way up.
The Elon Musk of a $20-30 billion corporation.
But I've worked for $15 billion corporations and met with the chairman of the board.
It was an interesting conversation in his office in India.
Very cordial, nice, wanted to hear what I had to say and then told my bosses, he's a keeper.
So my perception of that meeting way back when was, yeah, I was a little nervous, but I think I did okay.
But then to have that trickle down, you know, he's a keeper.
That was nice to hear that.
So some bosses get it and it might not be the positive reinforcement that some people demand.
And we know people like that, don't we?
They need to be constantly reminded about how good they are and you're such a value to the team.
Okay, great.
But when you get information like that, that's really important for me.
And I think for most, especially today, everybody is the ones that want to work.
We'll leave it at that.
They want to work harder.
They want to get new training.
They want to understand how they can better themselves.
They want to climb.
They want to get experience.
They want to be better at their job and be better for their company to be a better tool in the toolbox for them.
And I think that's a good portion, but not the portion that I really wish people would step up.
And, you know, so many people are, like I said, it's a, I'll give you a two-minute example.
There was somebody that was hired as a receptionist for a company.
And one of the added responsibilities was, can you do me a favor at night?
The cleaning people that we have come in here, the one that used to be here, she's no longer available.
She's going back, you know, to her other job.
So we have a little, for like the next week or two until they find somebody.
So they went around and they say, okay, this needs to be wiped down.
This needs to be wiped down.
And then please take out all the trash.
Okay.
So person comes back in the next day and she goes behind the reception desk and the trash can is still there.
But the other trash cans are all empty.
So the person was asked, why is this trash can full and the other ones are all empty?
Well, you didn't tell me to empty that one.
Now, I don't know how everybody that's listening to this is going to take that.
But that's just ridiculous.
They don't go one step forward.
I'll never forget that example when somebody told me that.
I was like, seriously?
He goes, yeah, yeah.
You didn't tell me to do that one.

Christine Laperriere:
They kind of missed the bigger inspiration behind the job.
But this was very, like I said, so fun.
I'm really glad that you took the time.
I know you're in the middle of going through a lot of medical treatments right now.
And so I appreciate that you took the time.
And I do think it's really special that you took the time to call out the great work that your leader is doing right now leading you because we need people to think, we need leaders that show that kind of compassion.
And leadership.
I think a lot of people are scared that if they're too compassionate, that somehow the results aren't going to be there or the business is going to go belly up.
And I think your boss is showing that that's not even close to the case.

Stephen Tomicki:
You want to know his name?
If you'd like to share it, we'd love to know.
His name is Robert Gauck, G-A-U-C-K.
And he's the division manager for the company I work for, which is AWT Environmental, based out of Old Bridge, New Jersey.

Christine Laperriere:
Wonderful.
And can we send him a shout out on LinkedIn?

Stephen Tomicki:
Sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I just would love to, you know, all of us have had those bad bosses, but it's really fun to cheer on the good ones.
So it sounds like he's made a massive impact on you.
And I can feel it when I'm listening to you.
Yeah.
Amazing.
All right.
I'm sending you the warmest wishes for healthy, healthy, healthy months and years ahead.
And again, thank you so much for taking the time, Steven.

Stephen Tomicki:
Thank you for including me.
Hopefully it makes some impact for people that listen.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Title: The 6 C's of inclusive leadership
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Patsy Doerr

Christine Laperriere:
So today I have Patsy on with me, and I am so thrilled you reached out and told me that you had a couple of inspiring stories to tell us, which to me is the most fun type of best boss podcast.
So Patsy, I'll go ahead and have you introduce yourself.
Tell everybody a little bit about where you're coming from today.

Patsy Doerr:
Sure, happy to.
And thank you so much for having me on the podcast today.
I think it's a great question and it really makes you think.
And so I'm delighted to be here.
In a brief nutshell, my career of the past 25 plus years, even though I hate to admit that, has been focused initially on talent development, then grew into diversity, equity, and inclusion, then grew into corporate social responsibility and ESG.
So my areas of expertise are really around in inclusion, talent, and ESG.
And I've had the opportunity to run organizations at the C-suite level on these topics and primarily in financial services, but also in data management.
And I also had the opportunity to run a nonprofit and live and work in three different continents between Europe, the United States, and Asia.
So I share that with you all because for me, the global perspective is really, really important to who I am and to people that I work with, including my best bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Well, I'm so glad this is gonna be great to get your perspective.
Not many people can say that, right?
Okay, I'm gonna dive right in.
When we asked you who is your best boss ever and why, what were some of the first things you thought of?

Patsy Doerr:
Absolutely.
Again, a great question.
And what I first thought about was really the fact that he, my best boss ever, was really an inclusive leader.
And I really mean that in the sense of that he would really take the time to understand people that worked with him, what were our drivers, what were our motivations, who were we, who are we as individuals and as people, and really to understand, listen, and apply that to how he behaved.
And I really, really am inspired by that approach.
In fact, it's something that I try to do myself as a boss as well because I think that is so important and many bosses don't necessarily take the time to really get to know what motivates their people.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me, as you would be in conversation with him, just tell me some of the ways he'd explicitly kind of bring this idea to life.

Patsy Doerr:
So a lot of it was about challenging me.
I'm an optimist at the highest end of the scale.
And so a lot of our conversations would be okay.
So we think about diversity, equity, inclusion.
At the time when I was working for this individual, I was the chief diversity officer for a large global organization.
And it was challenging, right?
Diversity, equity, and inclusion is challenging no matter where you are.
Historically, it's always been a challenging space.
And he would really make me dive into what are those challenges, right?
In addition to bringing people on board to the concept, helping them understand the why, the business case, the social case, even though we think that everybody knows that, they don't necessarily know that, and kind of digging into that, and also digging into both the element of quantitative metrics around how do you define success, but also, and I think this is particularly unique, is having that broad framework, but also really making sure that my approach and my role and my team, and his approach as well, was very individualized, and making sure that you're bringing one person along at a time implementing the broader strategy.
And so that's where our conversations got particularly interesting, saying, okay, well, what's the data behind this?
How are we measuring success?
But also, how do we actually bring person A on board, person B on board, and go from there, really holding their hand through their journey?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And so, I mean, obviously, he had that great connection with you, but how did you see him treat people that worked for you?
Or how did he treat other people in the organization, people that didn't report to him, people he didn't need loyalty from?
How did he treat them?

Patsy Doerr:
Well, it's also a great question.
So interestingly enough, slightly tangential, but related, this particular individual was a lawyer and came from running the legal business and then moved into a human resources capacity.
And I tell you that because he was very humble in his approach, I mean, already very successful with the organization, already at the executive level as part of the executive committee reporting into the CEO, but had this humility about him where he was always, always trying to learn something new.
So he really had that intellectual curiosity and then taking that to the next level, really having that learning agility to take on board that learning experience and to act on it, take the feedback and to act on it in every interaction.
So I saw him doing that regularly, not only with me, but with members of my team in terms of engaging with them.
He also did it in a very, very personal way.
So he spent a lot of time individually with each of us, his direct reports and our direct reports to really get to know us personally, which sounds very basic, but it's so important.
And that's not always the case with many, many bosses.
And I really appreciated that about him.
And additionally, I would say he was very respectful to everyone in the organization.
He was a role model for inclusive leadership and for respect in the sense that, and I'll give you a very specific example.
So if he wanted to reach out to a member of my team to seek their input on something, he would never do it without giving me the heads up or asking about it, right?
And that's a small thing, but it's really important.
And it really demonstrates, I think, respect very, very wholeheartedly.

Christine Laperriere:
He wanted to make sure that you felt included again in that what he was doing was all in honor of everyone.

Patsy Doerr:
A hundred percent.
And getting back to your question as well on that topic, I think the way he operated and continues to operate because we're still very much in touch.
In fact, I just had lunch with him two weeks ago.
He continues to be a mentor and a colleague and a partner.
At the end of the day, everything about him really goes back to inclusion.
So every way that he treated people in the organization, no matter who they were, no matter what level they were at, no matter where they were in the world, was always about inclusion and really creating that environment where people, including myself, felt valued and felt trusted.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And so one last question about him.
What was it like when there was a problem, when there was a struggle?
Did you ever see him get triggered or frustrated?
And how did he still carry some of these leadership qualities on a bad day?

Patsy Doerr:
Yeah, wow.
My best boss ever.
Definitely has a very quiet and a very, very steady approach to how he operates.
And so it was very rare that you would see him actually triggered, frankly, by anything, to be honest, which also made him that admirable because he had a very stressful job.
We all did.
And yet, you never saw him lose his cool per se.
Having said that, I remember one example with an interaction with the board where something had been communicated incorrectly about our diversity and inclusion strategy.
And clearly his relationship with the board was absolutely critical to his success, our success, and the entire organization.
He definitely had a moment where you could see him lose his cool and say, look, we've got to fix this.
We've got to rectify it.
But it was very short-lived.
And once we were on top of rectifying it, and basically rectifying it meant just being more communicative and being more transparent.
So we were able to address it rather quickly.
But I do recall that moment.
And I think clearly the interaction with the board made it that much more important, but it was a very rare moment.
And he always would come back very quickly from that triggered moment.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, it's interesting to see, right?
Because kind of how we handle our toughest day sometimes can be a really big metric for really how strongly rooted we are in our leadership values.
Do they just go out the window the minute you're having a bad day, or do they still remain present throughout the good and the bad?

Patsy Doerr:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
So you also mentioned you had another story about another leader.
I'd love to hear it.

Patsy Doerr:
Sure, happy to.
This is actually a pretty funny story.
So this is another boss that I had who was very good at the time.
And this was quite a while ago when I was living in Asia.
And what I appreciated about this particular individual, he happens to be a man as well, is that he was very supportive of me.
And so this is a very personal story.
I mean, I think he behaved, he was always a supportive leader, but it was very different depending on the individual, which I also appreciate.
But he was with me as an individual and as a person.
And we had lots of conversations about our family and our kids and things of that nature.
And so one of the things that happened is that I would fly over from Hong Kong to Zurich for our off sites.
He was based in Zurich.
And so we would have our off site meeting and there was always some sort of outdoor activity that we would participate in.
And he knew that although I'm a serious runner and I love sports, I'm definitely someone who is not more on the dressy side, right?
So he's told me in advance this particular trip and he would never tell us what we were doing.
He said, you really need to bring some casual clothes with you, Patsy.
When I say casual, I mean like snow boots and the whole gear.
Okay, sure, that sounds great.
So I of course wear skinny jeans and Ugg boots and a little parka.
Where my colleagues are wearing zip up snow suits.
And the other thing, so we get to this place and we finally discovered that we're going sledging, right?
So sledging is basically in Switzerland, sledding down a mountain.
You ride up a ski lift as you would as if you were skiing.
And then you get in an old wooden sled and you go all the way down the mountain.
Oh my God.
I'm scared of heights.
So we get, and it was snowing.
I'm not dressed appropriately.
It was kind of darkish because the snow was coming down and we got to the lift.
And I'm at the bottom of the lift and all my colleagues start going up.
And I said to my boss, I go, I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
I can't get on this lift.
I'm scared to death.
I really, and there was no bar or anything.
And so here's the best part of the story.
So he goes, Patsy, well, you're gonna do it.
I know you can do it.
You're very brave.
You've moved all over the world.
You take a lot of risks.
You can do it.
I'm like, no, I can't.
He goes, all right, as if I were a child.
And by the way, I know my 30s at this point, late 30s.
He goes, Patsy, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna ride up the lift and I'm gonna make sure that everything's okay and that it's not scary.
And I'm gonna call from the top and your colleague is going to stay here with you as we wait.
So he calls me from the top of the mountain.
He goes, everything's fine.
It's not scary.
Go up with your colleague.
It'll be fine.
And I hesitated for one second, right?
I just hesitated to say yes.
He goes, okay, I'm coming down to get you.
As I'm standing at the base of the snowy mountain, coming around the other side, of course, nobody else is on the other side of the lift, comes my boss with like icicles hanging out in his.
He's like, come pick me up.
I'm like a small child.
So I ended up going up the lift with him and I ended up having a fantastic time.
And you loved sledging.
And I loved it, even in my skinny jeans.

Christine Laperriere:
See, and that's interesting that you trusted him enough to go down a mountain on a wooden sled in your skinny jeans.
That's very impressive, actually.
That talks about his influence on you as a leader.
But even the fact that he came down to pick you up, there's something really unique about that.
It's like, that's how leaders bring people along sometimes.

Patsy Doerr:
Absolutely, because at that point, you feel very supported and therefore trusted and therefore confident enough to take a risk.

Christine Laperriere:
That is, it's an amazing metaphor for what it looks like at work, right?

Patsy Doerr:
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
So now when we started talking about best bosses, can you think of some that maybe didn't rank as best bosses?
And what were some of the lessons that you learned from those leaders?

Patsy Doerr:
Sure, absolutely.
Unfortunately, we all have not the best bosses sometimes, but I've had mostly very good bosses.
But when I think about a couple that weren't so great, there are a couple things that really stand out to me.
The first is the flip side of what I mentioned about my best boss, which is not taking the time to get to know you and not understanding what motivates you, not understanding what you like or dislike, not understanding how to manage you appropriately.
And this is something I've learned over the years as a boss myself, is that you really do need to understand that what motivates other people may not be what motivates you to start, and it certainly may not be what you expect motivates individuals.
So, and that does not lead to a positive outcome.
I think what that leads to is that you don't necessarily feel valued or trusted, and therefore your productivity and your commitment can suffer.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, that makes so much sense to me because I find sometimes when I'm coaching different leaders, if they're very driven by money, they'll go, well, I don't have to tell Jane she did a good job because she's getting paid good enough to know that she's doing a good job.
And I'm like, yeah, but Jane might not be as motivated by the bonus check as she is by the fact that you acknowledge her dedication in that moment or the great work she delivered or that she appreciates the verbal, you know, hey, that strategy's brilliant, you know.
Sometimes it's just that little bit, but if the leader thinks, well, I don't need that, then they just assume everybody else on the team doesn't need that.

Patsy Doerr:
Exactly.
And then what happens is that you're not only gonna have employees who don't feel valued or trusted, but engagement as well will drop.
That's exactly right.
You know, we as bosses and we as people reporting into bosses really need to think about what those factors are.
I mean, somebody might want a promotion versus a raise.
Somebody might want more responsibility and no raise.
You know, somebody might want more exposure.
You know, there are so many different aspects of how people wish to be developed or to grow their careers that not to take the time to truly appreciate or understand that just doesn't work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, it's a huge lost opportunity in a very short bed.
One of the questions I love to ask people, you know, you mentioned this even in the conversation with your first boss.
So you've been in the world of leadership development.
You've been in the world of DEI, right?
You understand all of these, what I would call, they're kind of hard to pin down, right?
They're, you know, operations are, you know, it's easy for us to tell you what the ROI is on increasing output of an operation, for example, or, you know, making a better investment.
But making an investment in your people to drive leaders to be best bosses is a tough sell often, right?
Organizations are like, why should I spend X amount of money to build best bosses?
And so I ask you, can you think of a way that you'd articulate the return on investment when you're working for a best boss versus when you're working for one of those not best bosses?

Patsy Doerr:
Yeah, it's also a great question.
And having been to your point in almost every role I've ever had, whether it was trying to sell leadership development or inclusion or even ESG, which tends to be more data-driven and a little bit more quantifiable, right?
For that reason, I think the issue is that, and how to explain it in my experience and how I continue to explain it is that you have to think about the continuum of the impact of not having good leaders or good bosses in place.
And so the way I think about it is looking at the entire employee life cycle, right?
So how are you going to attract the right talent?
How are you going to develop your talent?
How are you going to engage them?
How are you going to advance them and ultimately retain them?
So I think about it in that framework of those five areas of the life cycle to explain that if we don't address all aspects of the employee life cycle, you're ultimately going to lead to, as I mentioned briefly earlier, to a loss of engagement.
Therefore, a loss of productivity and there is a positive correlation to innovation as well.
And so therefore, at the end of the day, you're ultimately hitting the bottom line and profitability.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
And that it's so interesting because it makes sense to us.
It's just hard to draw out those numbers, right?
Like $100,000 spent here.
If we don't, we can't see the direct line to $100,000 saved here, but disengaged employees are costing the business, right?
Turnover of top talent costs the business.
The amount of time it takes for a new leader to train a new hire costs the business.
So it's so interesting how all those things add up, but there's no CFO that can nail down the exact line item of that cost, which makes leadership development often seen as a nice to have and not a need to have.

Patsy Doerr:
And I think that's exactly right because it's very difficult for a CFO to really pinpoint that.
Even though to your point, and I've been through this exercise before in various organizations, you can cost out at least an estimate in terms of losing someone, having to hire someone, and then having that period of onboarding before they actually become productive in their role, you can cost it out.
And you can cost out individual aspects of the employee life cycle.
But to your point, it's very difficult to say that that's a direct correlation or that it's an absolute number.
It's more of an estimate.
So it's a constant business case or proving the case for the importance of development and inclusion.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, absolutely.
What are some of the things that you feel are kind of worth people understanding if they're really aiming to build more inclusive leadership?

Patsy Doerr:
So there's a couple of things that I would say there.
We talked a lot about empathy, which is of course the overarching concept, but there's some research out there that I would encourage the listeners to take a look at, which is done by Deloitte a few years ago.
And it's the six C's of inclusive leadership.
I utilize it a lot in my work and I'll tell you what they are.
The first is courage, which we talked about as well.
The second is curiosity, which really links back to learning agility.
And then you have collaboration, the ability to work with different types of people across an organization.
Cultural competence, which is an aspect of inclusion that in my experience is less talked about than others, but really understanding from a global perspective, but also from a within our country perspective, the different cultures and how people behave accordingly and to be conscious of that.
The other one is commitment.
So being committed to being an inclusive leader, actually taking the time and the energy to do so.
And then finally, and these are not in any particular order, it's actually quite a we all the way they describe it, is cognizance.
And that is cognizance of our own strengths and our own development areas.
And from an inclusion perspective specifically, being cognizant of our own biases, both of those that we understand and know and are conscious of, and then of course taking the time to learn those that are unconscious biases.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing, amazing.
Those are, again, all of us can be kind of assessing ourselves.
How much am I actually doing in these camps, right?
Amazing.
So just as I kind of bring this to close, thankfully we have a lot of people out there that are listening to the show right now and they're working on becoming best bosses or they are probably secretly between us, I'm betting that they're best bosses and they're just looking for more tips and more tools, because that's the type of person who takes time to listen to this.
If you could give them some real genius words of wisdom, some action items to leave this conversation and take into practice, how would you help direct them?

Patsy Doerr:
Sure, absolutely.
And I would agree with you.
I would imagine that anybody who takes the time to listen to different types of resources or read about development is someone trying to better themselves, which already is a best boss.
There's a word I haven't mentioned yet that I think is really important to call out.
I think it's important to really be focused on empathy and really just, again, it's a concept of understanding your people, but taking it to the next level and being empathetic and to try to find ways to do that yourself by watching other people, by doing the research and just being intentional and conscious of how you behave with your people and everybody across your network or your ecosystem.
I think the second piece I would highlight is the importance of lifelong learning.
After many, many years of multiple research studies all around the globe on leadership, it is still indeed the case that the number one predictor of success is learning agility.
And that really is that.
And I know that many people on this call probably know that, but it's important, right?
Because we all need to be learning.
And I think it's important.
I know I take every conversation as a learning experience, whether it's an expression, an example, a story or otherwise, to really take that on board and adjust your behavior for the next setting.
And I think the third piece that I would bring up, and I feel very strongly about this one as well, is to have courage and to be bold in what you do.
And we all have varying levels of risk aversion or attraction to risk, but to really try to be as bold and courageous as you can, both as a boss and as someone.
We all have a boss and report to a boss, no matter what level you're at.
But to take that level of courage and to turn it into confidence and be bold where you can and take risks when you can within pushing yourself a little bit outside your comfort zone to the best of your ability.

Christine Laperriere:
And wouldn't you say it a lot of ways that that courage kind of marries up with the lifelong learning in a way?

Patsy Doerr:
It does.
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
It's the courage to try that different thing or to do something.
The comfortable stuff is already learning that we've gained, you know what I mean?
It's already inherent.
But the courage is really when you put that lifelong learning into practice, when you test something new and you're like, I don't know if this is gonna work because I've never done it before.
I think that's a neat one because it kind of goes in alignment with that.

Patsy Doerr:
It absolutely does.
That's a great point because they're very courage and lifelong learning imply change, right?
So change is a line concept that you have this openness to change and openness to trying things and openness to being courageous.
So I see to your point, all three of those coming together quite nicely.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And I love it because again, the empathy kind of also is, it's like having enough compassion for yourself to say, hey, I'm trying it out.
It's not about me.
I'm gonna experiment and learn and be compassionate with other people who are actually in the process of trying to stretch and be bold, as you said.

Patsy Doerr:
Right.
And then I would add that, as we think about the best boss, I think the other piece is, as we talk about this concept, it makes me think a lot about as a boss, giving your people the opportunity to fail.
Know that it's, certainly you don't want them to fail all the time because we need to run a business here.
But at the end of the day, to really have that, give people that freedom to know that if they do take a risk and they do fail, but they're transparent about it and they communicate it, that that's fine.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, I know.
And actually, I mean, to love those moments because they are so educational.
Amazing.
Any other last thoughts as we wrap this up?

Patsy Doerr:
I would just say that I encourage everyone to continue to learn as a leader.
I think, myself, 25 plus years in the work world, I learn something new every day.
And I would just encourage everybody on this call to take that time to do so because an hour spent, let's just make this up, an hour a day learning versus any other way of spending your time in the office or however your role plays out, it's worth its weight in gold.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
Perfect.
Well, listen, thank you again.
This was amazing.
And I think a lot of people are gonna be thinking about that, the empathy, the lifelong learning and that courage to be bold.

Patsy Doerr:
Well, thank you very much for having me.

Episode: 52
Title: The competitive advantage of holistic wellness
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Serena Quaglia

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I'm interviewing Serena.
So I'm going to have Serena introduce herself.
But what I love most is when somebody sees and hears the show and they get inspired and it gets their wheels turning and they start thinking about their best boss.
So Serena reached out to the show.
She has a great story.
And I'm on pins and needles because I haven't heard the story yet either.
So I'm super excited.
So Serena, welcome.

Serena Quaglia:
Thank you, Christine.
What an honor to be here.
I think it's so fantastic that you are disrupting sort of the leadership sphere and looking at what's the positive quality instead of.
And I've been very guilty of this hammering away at what I don't like about former bosses.
So thank you for that.
And so I'd like to say hello to everybody today.
My name is Serena Qualia.
I am currently a VP strategy at TCS Marketing Systems.
We are one of Canada's leading sales advisory groups to pre-construction real estate land development.
So we do mixed use, residential, commercial, retail, hospitality, etc.
And I also actually post pandemic have sort of started a project on the side to help empower women in business, regain confidence that they lost through the pandemic and to empower them with competitive advantage based on what I have learned in my former career as a professional dancer and my current career in city building.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Those sound like great day job and a great side project for you.
Amazing.
So we're just going to dive straight in.
We'll go right to the heart.
So tell us about your best boss.

Serena Quaglia:
So my best boss ever was the first boss I ever had.
And it's actually not just one boss.
It was the entire C-suite and management team.
I did a bachelor of fine arts in modern dance at the University of Utah.
And the week I graduated, I went to Las Vegas just for audition experience.
And I auditioned for this 100 million dollar show at the MGM Grand.
And after a series of callbacks, I was selected as an original cast member in this 100 million dollar show, starring a Broadway star, Michael Crawford, who was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.

Serena Quaglia:
Oh, wow.

Christine Laperriere:
It had fire breathing dragons, animatronics designed by George Lucas's shop of, you know, Star Wars fame.
The sets were so large.
We needed NASA technology to move these monstrous sets.
So it was really, you know, this immersion into this other world of basically insanity at the largest hotel at the time in the world and the largest show that had ever been produced.
So they were my best boss, being that we were, you know, in an entertainment department and we were kind of in our own silo because, you know, obviously we're not housekeeping, we're not marketing, we're not in the casino.
We're not in the amusement park.
So we had our direct reports and our, you know, our choreographer, our artistic director, the director, the producer, which ran our show and ran our rehearsals like thrill sergeants, but they were the yin.
There was this yin and yang.
There was this perfectionist.
You have, you know, quality assurance, the show, the everything had to be perfect.
But the C suite, the management team had implemented policies that absolutely gave every single employee, seventy five hundred employees at that site confidence and security in our wellness and well-being.
So I want to say that this mixture of the quest to be the best, the best show, the best product, the best performers, the best experience mixed with, you know, this management team that through its HR policies.
And I'm going to talk about that in a second.
They provided us, the employees, this amazing three hundred and sixty degree holistic approach to our careers.
We had intellectual mental wellness, emotional, physical, occupational, financial, social and environmental wellness.
So, Christine, I and I and that team, I have been striving to take elements of their policy and their, you know, management style and their empathy and their, again, quest to this quest for competitive advantage and kind of execute that with my own teams over the years.

Christine Laperriere:
My mind is boggled.
So you're going to have to explain how on earth do they do that?
Because, you know, people see those things as competing, right?
They see those things as the stride for the best and holistic wellness as in direct competition.
So I'm dying to know how did they do it?

Serena Quaglia:
You nailed it like this.
Woo Woo, Kumbaya, actually Christine, is competitive advantage.
It is at the root of competitive advantage.
So they did it.
So, so for example, I'm going to give you the first example.
So we weren't union.
We were just independent contractors.
And at the time, MGM said we will enable all employees to have a $5 baby.
Okay.
So health benefits, dancers, housekeepers, people, car dealers, you know, the people that didn't make huge salaries were able to, without health insurance, be respected, keep their jobs and deliver a baby for $5.
Like they, MGM paid all of the expenses around.
And you have to understand in Canada, we assume that maternity coverage, et cetera, is just, it's a given.
I know we pay for that through taxes, but it's a given.
In the States, not.
So one of the thinking was, well, people are just going to have these babies and they're going to quit and they're never going to come back to their jobs.
But the opposite happened.
Dancers, housekeeping, security, whatnot, went away, had their babies and they came back and they became lifers for MGM grant because of the, you know, the commitment to their health and wellbeing and their building a family and the supports.
So that was one example of, of this investment and confidence and security of their employees.
The second thing I wanted to point out was again, you know, when I worked there, this was early on in, in the HIV crisis, so one of my male dance partners, he was one of the first in the era to test positive for HIV.
And at the time there wasn't a lot of, you know, data solutions, right?
So he could have been let go.
The argument could have been made that he was endangering the cast because we sweat all over each other.
You spit sometimes when you're singing and dancing and insurance didn't cover the treatment.
And MGM grant took a stand that it would, it would help him with his treatment path and it stood by him and it set a precedent.
Like this was, these were uncharted territories and we're talking about, this was one dancer, you know, in 2022 MGM resorts international, their revenue was 13 billion and their annual gross profit was $6 billion.
And they cared.
And I don't know what it was when I worked there, but one dancer, they went out on a limb, like they, they changed this paradigm shift for that one dancer.
And another example, which I think is really where this woo woo kumbaya is competitive advantage.
So our stage are, we had the largest stage in the state of Nevada and bigger, it was a bigger stage than any of the stages in Broadway.
Like the sets would not have pants on any, in any theaters in New York city, and we had all this dry ice and we had, you know, all these special effects and fire and blah, blah, blah.
And so the HVAC system in theater was so large and complicated that when it, we had a dry ice curtain wall.
So because the stage was so big, they didn't have time to like have curtains close and they like would do a set change.
It did it behind dry ice and the dry ice had this chemical reaction when it was super, super hot outside in the desert and it created its own weather system in the theater and it's snowed on stage.
So this happened in rehearsals and you know, a lot of the long-term dancers that had done other shows in Las Vegas and had a lot of experience, they were like, this is unacceptable.
And, and because we weren't union, you know, we kind of those of us that were newbies, we kind of just went along with what these seasoned professionals were expressing, you know, that this is unacceptable, people are going to get hurt.
So long story short, we had this huge, huge show one night and there were all these famous people from Hollywood and who's who and media and of course that night it snowed on stage.
And so the elder cast members were like holding their arms up in the wings, like nobody is going on stage.
So this whole number, it was like a three minute, four minute number.
Like there's light shows and effects and there were no dancers on stage and no singers on stage.
At the end of the show, we went downstairs and all of us who weren't the seasoned professionals thought we're going to lose our jobs, we're going to get fired.
Like this is, this is not okay.

Christine Laperriere:
Right?
We just put the nail in the coffin.
We're done.

Serena Quaglia:
We're never going to work in this town again.
Right.
I completely like, so C-suite comes downstairs.
There were probably 10 men in suits and ties.
Accounting was there.
Security was there.
HR was there and we were prepared to get fired or our walking papers.
And instead the CEO said, I'm livid and I'm embarrassed and you humiliated me and I want to take this as a teaching moment.
I'm going to put that aside right now.
And I want to teach you a little bit about economics.
You didn't just humiliate me that that's not the point here.
I want to tell you how you impacted your colleagues, your sort of the beverages, the food and beverage in the theater, the cocktail servers who are not going to make tips tonight.
And they went on this whole economics lesson about how our split-second decision impacted, yes, the suites and probably some revenue and some corporate reputations, but they really focused on how it impacted the totality, the holistic staff and their livelihoods and their ability to how it impacted them financially and emotionally.
And the best part was the C-suite said, we really want to take this teaching moment to understand and let you know that we're going to work with engineering to ensure this will never happen again.
And they pulled engineering down.
And so engineering then kind of got read the riot act.
Like how could you and they, how could you have missed that calculation answers and debt jeopardy?
And it just became again, this kumbaya communication.
All the silos were broken down and we had this amazing was probably a two and a half hour session to communicate.
So this was like, I mean, coming right out of university, I had no, nothing to compare it to, but now I've had 20 years, you know, in management and other corporate situations, how I can't even imagine that level of patience and that level of commitment to solving problem solving in real time.
And, you know, the, the fact that marketing had to go back out to all of these guests and say, you know, we're giving refunds and we understood the implications of that and we all kept our jobs and we actually had way more respect for our leaders, right?
Because we learned so much and we learned, you know, it wasn't just about us and our like, Ooh, I'm going to fall down and potentially break my spine, but this really impacts every department.
And so that singular piece, I think I have in all my years post and in working, you know, transitioning into business and working corporate.
It's the single piece that I do not see.
And yes, right.
The, the interconnectedness of, and the interrelatedness of all the departments were working off the same song sheet.

Christine Laperriere:
I am just floored by that story.
It is so cool to me.
I've never heard anything quite like it.
And, you know, I used to launch, you know, my career started as an engineer at Chrysler.
And so I was responsible for JD powers and I was responsible for how the customer interfaced with the vehicle once it was shipped, but I also worked in the plant and so, you know, what I, I've never seen in the way that you said that story, we were so siloed that anytime there was a problem, it was more who to shoot.
Yes, it was the hootiest shoot.
They were like, pull the engineer out here and let's shoot them.
Oh, it must be quality or it must be design or it must be manufacturing.
But it wasn't what I really think is so powerful in the story.
The way you gave this example is like, it sounds like they brought everyone together and then they said like, I need you to think about how you're, you're impacting things.
But then they turned to engineering and they go, I need you to think about how you're impacting things, you know, and so it wasn't like the answers were sure you guys made one decision and that wasn't, you know, it didn't go well, but that they recognized all of how everybody influenced that, that big giant fail.
Everybody failed that night.

Serena Quaglia:
Your hootiest shoot is so what I've experienced.
I mean, I've worked with some great people in land development, but, but we find that too with our, you know, construction doesn't, you know, decor center might say sell an island and a kitchen and an it's not, you know, on the construction notes and then construction's like, then the person moves into the condo or the house and they're like, why is my kitchen look?
And then it's hootiest shoot Christine that permeates so many industries.
And I think that is why this particular experience at MGM ground.
I mean, I honestly, the physio are cast physiotherapist was there giving data on well, if the dancers fell and then they have back problems and this is what it's going to cost.
And this is what it's going to cost them personally.
And this is where it's going to cost the you, the business.
And then the engineering department's like, you know, okay, well this went wrong and then everyone was there.
Sound and lighting designs were there.
Right.
Department was there.
The custodial, like the people who had to mop up the snow on the stage.
Yes.
Right.
They had extra billable hours.
So like they, this management team, like knowing how balance sheets and pro forma's work now, I mean, they were so super responsive to like calculate the losses across the board and how it's preventable.
And okay, there was that side of it, but they really were invested in it not happening again.
They were invested in keeping their talent.
Like we were known as the talent, right?
The entertainers happy and safe.
They were invested in keeping engineering, you know, employed and risk aversion, like not having to face risk and insurance policies and all that.

Christine Laperriere:
Sure.

Serena Quaglia:
Right.
So those calculations were going, you could see it in real time.
These people were like, these are super smart people, but they never made us feel like we were numbers.
And I think that's the difference.
And with some of the bosses I've worked in, like residential land development, when we're trying to blow out a thousand units in a high rise condo and we're trying to move everyone in, you know, like you're occupying whatever 600 people moving in on the same day.
And I did have a purchaser say to me once when I was working with sales marketing and customer care, they're like, you're just treating me like I'm a number.
You just want my occupy, you know, you just want my, all my checks to clear today.
I am not a number.
This is the biggest expense I've ever made in my life.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Serena Quaglia:
I was like, wow, that difference that, you know, to calibrate the business side, the numbers side with people behind these numbers.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, I think that's incredible.
I think it's incredible.
And it's just such a great testament to what happens when you decide that we all failed today, right?
We all failed.
And so we're all going to fix it.
And every single one of you, you know, is going to figure out what part you played in this failure.

Serena Quaglia:
You're right.
Because too, like, I mean, I was probably one of the least like that I was right out of school.
So like, that was my first job, job, job, real job, like paying job.
And I, at that moment too, was like, well, I'm feeling strong-armed.
Like I, I probably would have gone out on stage and danced while it's snowing and not really thought much of it if I fell down, whatever.
So even at that level of minutiae, like, you know, I'm just being led by these task members that maybe don't have my best interest.
Like, you know, there's all the independence and then the collectiveness and then the, you're reporting up and then the, so all these different dynamics.
And we really had to, to your point, all of us sat there downstairs with our rehearsal area, like three stories down in the basement.
There was this massive, like this huge, and we all sat on the floor and we, none of us left that night until to your point, we talked it through, we, there were tears, there were the, here's the problem.
Here's how it could have played out.
Here's the implications.
Here's what we're going to do.
So it doesn't play out, like how we can fix it here, all the note-takers like all, you know, they were, they were documenting this.
And it's interesting Christine, because, because of that, that kind of convergence of problems and management and problem solving.
And I wrote my master's thesis actually about my time at MGM Grant, I went back and did an ethnography about this convergence of, you know, performing arts, built form architecture, technology, how it all works in place making.
That's actually how I ended up in land development.
But the point being, when I went back to MGM years later, whoever was left there in management was like, Serena, I want to go on record and interview, be part of the interview of your, you know, your research, they actually read my thesis.
Oh, that's so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.

Serena Quaglia:
Isn't that hilarious?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, what a cool story though.
Like I said, I'm immediately, and even, you know, the $5 baby, like what a, you know, I didn't know where you were going with that when you first said it and I was like, now I'm listening, I'm going, I can only imagine how the feeling of just knowing that that's how your company views it, or, you know, when I think of what the 80s would have been like for somebody who was first diagnosed with HIV and, you people who were diagnosed with that early went through to think that the company, you know, took care of them and said, you know, hey, this is who we are.
Like, like you said, $6 billion in profit.

Serena Quaglia:
And why should they care?
Right.
And point two, your insight actually really, it's made me think the $5 baby, they actually, that was a HR corporate.
That was a way to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace.
They, MGM set out to, because at the time the Mirage, the Baragio, New York, New York, like all these, the Luxor, like these big mega resorts were biting on MGM's heels.
Right.
And they were cutting into market share and MGM made a conscious decision that part of their recruiting technique was this $5 baby.
They wanted the best, the brightest, the most visionary.
They wanted long-term employees.
They didn't want churn.
And so that someone, some analyst somewhere did the math, right?
If we treat our employees with deliver what they want, they will stay with us.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Serena Quaglia:
Counterintuitive, but it, but it works.
I had girlfriends and my castmates who were there for 15 years.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
I think, you know, the thing that's landing to me while I'm thinking about what you're saying, cause I'm really having a massive epiphany too.
It's like, you can hold people to this excruciatingly high level of performance if you care about them, like to no end.
Do you know what I mean?

Serena Quaglia:
I love how you sum that up because our, my direct Gail Siegler, she was our assistant choreographer.
Our choreographer was from London.
He did tons of West End shows.
He did chess.
He did all these things, but on the ground, on the boots, like every day, you know, we had notes, we had criticisms, we were like, it was, we were raised that way though.
And Dan, competitive dance, you're like, you're trying to achieve perfection, and the quality assurance on that, like she, she was a drill sergeant, but because we were all raised in that sort of that mindset, we, okay, we would be grumpy about it some days, but it was to your point, the bigger overarching backdrop, there was this big hug, right?
This big, you know, we're giving you, we might be really hard on you with your performance notes and you're not hitting your mark.
And we're gonna, you know, and we're going to tell you, we're going to be critical on these 10 points, but just know that you also have the best physiotherapist in the state, downstairs accessible 24 hours a day, you also have X, Y, Z, P, Q, right?
So there was this equilibrium of.
I'm going to go to work and perform, give 100% every day.
And I am going to be rewarded for it.
Oh, here's another interesting point too.
They, in our welcome packages, like when you checked in with HR, they gave us this booklet, the AGM booklet, the, you know, and here's how to invest.
And here's how shares work.
And here's how we want you to buy some shares so that you come to the AGM, so you have a vote and you have a voice and here's why it's important for you to have a voice.
And here's how we want to help you.
We don't want you to gamble on our properties and we want you to save your money and do like, I mean, this was, it was kind of lost on me at the time.
Cause I was young.
I was like right at the school.
Fortunately, my dad was like, Trina buy some, buy 10 shares and then you can go to this meeting.
And so I did, and then my, some of my castmates did, and like, this is how they, they were invested in us to, to grow financially, intellectually, emotionally.

Christine Laperriere:
That is really something.
I can't believe it.
I'm like listening to this going, this is really cool.
I haven't heard a story like this one in a while.

Serena Quaglia:
Well, it's so interesting because you who came through with a master's degree in engineering and now you are helping, you know, kind of holistic development and in leaders and in business owners and helping people level off.
It's so interesting to me because, because coming, I come from the opposite, right?
And it came to me soft sciences side and ended up in a business that it is all just numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, revenue, balance sheet, balance sheet, balance sheet.
And so the blending of the best of both worlds really creates amazing, amazingness.
I think you probably see that yourself.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
That's what I'm just, like I said, I'm just really very impressed.
And I just, I just wrote down in my notes.
I was really thinking about this extreme performance requires extreme wellness.

Serena Quaglia:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
Like, what if you believed that?
Like it sounds like they believed it so much that it became the way they drove, like, so we have got to take such good care of you because the level of performance that we're expecting, like it cannot be your wellness that is the drain on you.

Serena Quaglia:
You know what?
I have a, I have the complete opposite.
So I jumped on some cruise ships and did some cruise ship contracts to whatever, travel, see the world, whatnot.
And one of the choreographers slash producers of one of our shows, and this was a, this was a reputable big ship, big budget.
I was written up.
I got in trouble on that contract because I didn't drink with customers because I didn't drink alcohol at MGM ground.
We were drug tested and we couldn't show up with a hangover, et cetera.
And on this cruise ship, they were like, you have to, you know, participate and be friendly with the guests.
And I was Serena.
We want it.
You don't drink your, I don't never see you with a drink in your hand, sitting with the passengers.
And I'm like, like this to me, I'm in this, you know, present profession that demands elite physical performance.
And I'm getting reprimanded for not drinking alcoholic beverages.
So that one, I couldn't compute.
I was like, this is not the place for me.
That said, MGM resorts to your point, wellness extended beyond.
You know, the physical wellness of dancers or housekeepers or it's really interesting to we, the, the cafeteria was probably a city block.
It was on the, it was two levels below the lobby was.
And it, it was this massive escalator.
If you can think of these mega resorts in Las Vegas, like the whole floor was, and it's a, it's like a little city, right?
So 24 hours a day.
So it was unlimited.
It was like, you picture the big buffets in Las Vegas.
That's what we had downstairs for, for the cat, for the get, for the staff, for the employee.
So salad bars and ice cream bars and whatever roast beef, whatever you wanted was down there.
And constantly the C suite, again, management was always getting paged because they were never in their offices.
They were always talking to the staff in this cafeteria.
And so this cafeteria, like we would all be like in our little islands, right?
Like the performers would be with the performers and the car dealers would be hard dealers.
And the pit bosses would eat with the pit bosses.
And then management would just circle all these tables and like, how's the food?
What are you hearing on the floor?
What are you getting pushed back from?
And why don't you go sit with, why don't you go talk to some of the, you know, the singers over there?
Why don't you meet the people in the amusement park?
It was like, it was like they were at hosting a party, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
But it makes so much sense, right?
So that's where you build rapport.
Like you build the ability to like, and know the people that you work with.

Serena Quaglia:
Exactly.
And, you know, I just read on LinkedIn, the CEO of Starbucks is now working, said he's going to work for half a day, I think a month or something in his stores and in Starbucks so he can get a feel of the floor and the flow and what customers, what his, the consumers want and what the problems are.
And, and that is, that is what these best bosses, in my opinion, did way back in the day to turn this business into, you know, such that it can have an annual gross profit of 6 billion a year.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
And have, you know, I mean, it's amazing.
I think it's so great.
And it's like, you know, they, they kind of debunked silos, the ivory tower, the, you know, some of these classic things that we, so many of us in business, we've just learned to accept a lot of that.
It's like we, most of us accept the fact that we don't meet the CEO of most businesses that we might work with.
You know, we're used to like, oh, well, it's procurement's fault.
That didn't work.
And everybody shoots them.
You know, it's like the, that, that day they become the ones that get in trouble for that.
And so I think it's just very interesting that they debunked the fear that what if we treated our people with extreme wellness, would it be in competition with the performance?
And like they said, we're going to, we're going to debunk that, you know?

Serena Quaglia:
Yes, that's so well put.
That's so well summarized.
Like right down to the point, like, I don't know what a counselor ceiling does in a hotel.
Like I don't, but they wove it all, the interrelatedness of it all together.
Like we knew that all of that employee at the next table in that cafeteria had a purpose and we had, we hoped that they were filled in.
You know, that role and, and you know, they too, like I have worked in other properties where we, you know, the staff wasn't permitted to go out to the casino floor and you weren't permitted to go to the boxing match or the entertainment.
And at MGM ground, they were like, they would give tickets to the valets, they would give tickets to the housekeeping that had, you know, the girls that are scrubbing the, the aft tubs, like they treated it right.
They big ticket items.
They, it was, that was really special.
That was really special.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
That is amazing.
I love this.
Okay.
So just to go back now, when you think of, you know, I'm going to go to the question that kind of is really sticking in my mind.
So when we're busy investing in people, creating these best bosses, there's always a question around what's the return on investment.
So, you know, why would we spend all this money to help build these great leaders and run all these wonderful programs and everything else?
Right.
What is the return on investment?
If you had to guess, I know it's not an easy thing for you, but you know, like given the, you know, this was a while back, but if you had to guess when you look at the businesses that you're interacting with now, what is the return on investment of working for a best boss versus a mediocre one?

Serena Quaglia:
So output and productivity of employees, I can't say quantify with a percentage or a dollar value, but just having managed, having had terrible bosses and have been, been a VP for those terrible bosses.
So being the sounding board of all the employees complaining about that terrible boss, I can, a employee turnover is, is measurable.
I had employees just stop coming to work, like didn't show up.
I couldn't even find them.
I can't do it the other day.
Like I'm, I'm having pies.
I'm, I'm at the cottage and I'm never returning to Toronto.
They basically drove me out of the workforce.
I would say productivity and, and loyalty and going that extra mile.
Like, and problem solving in inter-departmentally, like I was a VP for sales and marketing and in land development for a lot of years, but there's so much crossover into customer care and what that customer journey is from the point of sale to when, you know, okay, they've got the, they own the condo, but it's getting built for, you know, it takes five years to build the thing.
And so the communication breakdown between the, you know, they got their AP, they signed their APS and they, they own a condo to not hearing from a developer for two to three to five years, that whole thing.
And then they, they get a letter three, six weeks before they're supposed to move in saying, you're, you know, you're occupying this condo.
It's yours.
And then not helping with move.
It caused poor, poor corporate reputation, which caused.
Extreme burnout for anyone dealing on customer service side, like customer care and customer service.
So the churn there, the employee turnover was, was terrible and the customer experience ultimately.
And I worked pre social media days and then social media days, right?
Pre social media days, you could manage that.
You could keep a lid on it and you could, your, your, the goal was just to keep people out of court from suing now there's Facebook groups and there's your, you know, and so the, the management of that.
Christine is what is the cost, the cost, the business and what people are willing to pay for what you're, what you're offering versus your competitors, the entire customer journey, the entire customer experience.
That's the cost.
Are you, are you within land development?
Are we going to sit with that inventory a long time because we have a crappy corporate reputation and we can't sell it, but the guy across the street can write.
So what's the cost of borrowing money?
What's the cost of training people?
What's the cost of keeping unhappy customers off of social media?
What does that cost you when you have to hire crisis communications PR managers, what does that cost you when they're going, you know, they're going on podcasts and they're the worst boss podcast.
They're going to talk about, well, I had this terrible experience.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly right.
Well, and you see that in glass door and some of these tools like LinkedIn for sure, you know, people, you know, when you get fired, I mean, I just read somebody's post the other day and they were heartlessly let go due to downsizing and budget restrictions.
Well, guess what?
That person leaves a story about how upsetting that is.
And it's not hard to click on their profile and find out where they just worked.
And it's like no noted because when I hear stuff like that, I, I do think why can you not be a classy organization and treat people with respect, come on.

Serena Quaglia:
Yeah.
And I think to your point too, you know, I, I'm older.
I'm 50.
I'm so I came from the school of thought where you don't.
You like the authority has power and that you just don't talk about your bad experiences or you don't air it out on LinkedIn.
Right.
Like that I just came through the generation...

Christine Laperriere:
Where you just keep your dirty laundry to yourself.

Serena Quaglia:
Yes, totally.
Right.
And now it's, it's anything goes rightly or wrongly.
I'm not here to make that argument, but it's, it is what it is.
So it's interesting to see some former management that I've worked for it, didn't, didn't learn, didn't learn when, when, you know, their brands were dragged on social media and they can't get their, their sales velocity slows down.
If they've canceled projects, the people who are have now have no they go to the Globe and Mail and right.
There's a full page piece.
So I think now more than ever, if I'm in management, I'm listening to you, Christine, and what you're reporting that you're hearing from these employees and middle managers.
And I mean, if I'm leading a big company now more than ever, I want to understand, I want to hire you and understand how can I empower my people so that we all, A, stay afloat, B, the shareholders are happy, C, we can all earn our performance bonuses, D, we're happier people.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
So really quick, if what did you learn from your least favorite bosses?

Serena Quaglia:
I learned what, that's a great question.
What did I learn from my least favorite bosses?
I learned that if you stay with the bosses that tend to be completely 1000% all about being obsessed with just the numbers, the bottom line and don't treat employees like people with emotions and needs and families and health issues that they might need a day off to take care of.
It can become emotionally abusive and overbearing.
And if you stay there too long, it's very unhealthy.
That unhealthiness seeps into like, you know, becomes a crisis of confidence, we internalize that, we physically get sick, but it takes longer and longer to find, you know, the stories, the belief in ourselves to be able to get back onto LinkedIn and say, you know, get out there post with power, kind of, you know, the roads.
So I would say in my experience, if, if, you know, the people out there are working with bosses that are eroding you, eroding you and your, your vision and your capabilities and your abilities, look elsewhere, move, get out, go, get out, go to where you're appreciated.
There are people like you, there are bosses like me and you and the people you help sustain that there are good bosses out there.
Wholeheartedly.
Don't like, it's not worth it.
It's not, you know, it's funny.

Christine Laperriere:
Cause I always say that we vote with our dollar, right?
So every time you spend money, you're voting for that company.
You're voting for that leadership.
And it's, when I hear you say that we're also voting with our employment.

Serena Quaglia:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
You know, so brilliant.
Yes.
Right.
Like we're saying, Hey, like if I work for you, that's cause I support you.
And I believe in this company's mission and what they're doing and their leadership.
And so, you know, vote with your time and energy as an employee.
And just like you said, if the, if the values don't align, move on somewhere else, go find a place.
Cause we're going to make being a horrible boss, unsustainable.
If we vote with our employment, you need to write a book on that.

Serena Quaglia:
Honestly, that is brilliant.
And write a book, Christine, write that down because I will, and I can be case study for, for the person who, I mean, as great as MGM, I know this is the best boss podcast and I want to focus on that, but I, I have been at ground zero where I stayed with one company too long.
Like I just, I just kept thinking it's going to change.
They're going to change.
We have, you know, that things are going to change and it didn't.
And I stayed there too long and it took me, it probably set me back too.
Honestly, I can quantify that one two to four years of my career.
Like I, it took me, I was so beaten down when I left there.
And I didn't even leave on my own accord.
Like I ended up getting pink slipped because they, they were like downsizing, but I'm like, what if downsize call it what you want.
I got fired.
And so that on top of, I knew I should have pulled the parachute that, you know, four years prior.
So then there was the shame and the guilt and beating myself up.
And so to everybody.

Christine Laperriere:
It's not easy.
It's awful when you go through that experience and it's hard to change jobs.

Serena Quaglia:
And it's hard to, you know, okay, this pay is whatever you need.
You have this lifestyle, but it doesn't cost anything to look for work or to network when you're, when you're unappreciated, right.
And I'm happy like work.
What is that saying?
Love shouldn't hurt and neither should your job.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
I like that too.
I can't believe how much I enjoyed our conversation today.
Serena, I really appreciate your time.

Serena Quaglia:
Thank you so much for having me on your show.
And thank you for all the great work you're doing and for all the inspiration that you are sharing.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you.
Well, your story is going to inspire so many people.
I'll be talking about this.
I can tell you.
So I really appreciate it.

Serena Quaglia:
Thank you very much.
And to all the listeners out there, all the best to you.

Title: Unlocking potential through allyship
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Vasie Papadopoulos

Christine Laperriere:
Today we have Vassi on the show, and I'm really excited to interview her because she reached out to the show to tell us about a great leader that she worked for.
And those are my favorite stories, the people who are so inspired when they catch the title best boss ever, somebody immediately comes to mind.
So Vassi, please introduce yourself.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Thank you, Christine.
My name is Vassi Papadopoulos, Greek Canadian, of course, by the last name.
I currently work as the vice president of corporate communications here at an agency in Toronto called BelieveCo, and I wanted the opportunity to sit down and speak with you and be able to really share a great experience of having lived through and being managed by a great boss.
It would have been in my last role, who is also male.
When we have this conversation, it makes a big difference as someone as a woman, in leadership spaces and in places sometimes where you don't see a lot of us as women.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
Well, listen, I just want to dive in.
So tell us, the best boss you've ever had, tell us a little bit about who he was and why he came to mind when you heard about this show.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
He really came to mind because in my previous role, and I've sort of, I would say, I've made a career in working in really, really tough industries.
And my last industry was a very tough one.
It was what I would say, very male dominated.
And so, you know, sometimes when you want to be a good leader and develop yourself and you don't see a lot of other women around, it's hard to be represented.
It's sometimes hard to have that voice, even for someone like me, where people would say, you know, she's confident, she's capable and so forth.
And so in this case, when I thought about what made him such a great boss was really the notion of allyship and being a man in a situation where he really tried to understand my perspective as a female leader in an environment where I was trying to be effective.
I was trying to be empowering.
I was really trying to work through a system and really make changes.
And so for me, that allyship, you know, sometimes is very difficult to find.
And it's difficult to find in groups that maybe not understand the journey that you're in or the things that you experience in a workplace.
And maybe I can get into, you know, what I mean by allyship.
And one of the things that he was really able to help me do was to sort of, as a woman, put me in situations where my profile was elevated and I wasn't always thought of as, hey, this is Vasie.
She's the social fun coordinator of things.
Or, you know, maybe she'll be the one that will organize the workshop or she'll do kind of, you know, she'll take on some of that administrative role.
And sometimes I think as women, Christine, like, we don't know that we do it.
We're sort of conditioned and we default and are like, absolutely, I'll take that kind of work on.
But then you realize in an organization, like, why is it tipped towards us as women?

Christine Laperriere:
One of my clients calls that non-promotable tasks.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
They're the tasks that we raise our hand to help with.
And we're like, yeah, we'll organize the workshop.
We'll pick up the birthday cake.
But they're non-promotable tasks.
So it's a whole extra workload.
But at the end of the day, you know, you can't go at the end of the year for your performance review and say, but I'm the one that organized the workshop and I'm the one that sent out the meeting notices.
And I'm like, you know, I'm like, nobody's going to give you a leadership position for that.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Exactly.
Right.
And it took me quite a lot of time in my career.
And I think maybe for other women as well to recognize that and say, there's still room to do it.
Of course, you could do some of it, but it was sort of, I was at a point where I didn't want to be seen as just the person or the go-to person and to be very blunt, to be on the social committee, you know, and go organize this and organize that.
And, you know, I had a conversation with this boss, with him.
And I said to him very openly, I don't want to be this person all the time.
That's default put into these situations because of my personality and who I am and what I project.
Like, I am more than that.
I'm smart.
I'm capable.
I have a good skill set.
That's why you hired me.
And so after that conversation, you know, one of the things he was able to do for me was there was an opening in our company's pension board.
So, you know, I was working at a very large multinational.
We've got this pension board where you need directors internally from various areas of the organization.
And he put my name up to say, Bassie, I think you're capable.
You can come from a corporate affairs perspective in this role.
And that really was sort of a turning point because it ended up becoming, A, he listened to me to be like, don't make me the social committee person to be very blunt, but allow me to really, you know, expand my breadth of experience and my knowledge.
And fine, like you can say, you know, why would Bassie sit on a pension board?
On the flip side is why wouldn't I?
I come from a different perspective.
I have a different background.
No, I don't have, you know, maybe the financial or the technical skill set of that.
And so that was, you know, one of the first times in my career where it was I provided that desire and feedback to want to be seen and to be able to do something different.
And, you know, he found that opportunity for me.
And I sat on that board until I left the company.
You know, I sat on it for four years and it was for me a very enjoyable thing to do.
And I really grew as a leader because it was something completely different and outside of what I would say, my normal scope of work and my day-to-day work.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, that's a great example because I'm hearing some sponsorship there.
So he's advocating for you behind your back, right?
With the folks that make decisions.
I also hear he's elevating your influence, right?
So he's putting you in a position where you actually have more impact and influence, which really is one of the challenges we have, right?
In that environment.
And third, I think what's really neat about this is I have lobbied time and time again, that if we really want to drive the diversity and inclusion agenda, we need to build amazing bosses.
It doesn't matter if they're men, women, green, blue, black, we don't care.
We just need amazing leaders.
So what happened there is you having an amazing boss just helped retain you, helped grow you, and then probably opens the door then for other people that want to join the organization.
They now look up and see someone that looks like them, right?
So it creates a culture change.
But we don't need, you know, a lot of people perceive that women need to be the driver of DEI or people with diverse backgrounds.
And I actually argue quite the opposite.
We need amazing best boss ever male leaders who can sponsor and be allies for anybody.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Absolutely.
And I think that's what's always missing from a female perspective is that we take that burden on ourselves and think, hey, you and I, Christine, we're women, we have to be the champions all the time.
We have to push the agenda.
But the way a lot of structures are built and systems are built, that's not the case.
I find that also exhausting.
Like, I mean, you do have to develop self-advocacy, but you also need a network of people, especially a good boss to then be your champion and your advocate.
And in this specific example, that's exactly what he was.
And it was like, I hear where you're coming from you don't want to be known as X.
And then he was able to find something that said, something that'll stretch me, give me profile and something that was also enjoyable where I could learn more.
And that was really like a good aha moment for me.
And I think sometimes men leaders feel like, what is it that I can really do for maybe a woman or maybe like a person of color or somebody that is not reflected in the organization?
And all I want to say is, this is a perfect example of something very basic and small that is allyship.
Sometimes the gestures don't have to be grand.
They don't have to be sleeping.
They have to be little changes where you're able to influence in areas where you can.
So then the reflection of that employee base changes over time.

Christine Laperriere:
And what other stories do you have?
I mean, tell me more about this leader and their ability to demonstrate allyship.
That's such a big word.
And just like you said, it's very hard for people to picture.
What do I look like if I'm being an ally?

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Yeah, I think the other piece in parallel with this notion of putting me into different spaces.
When I was working at the company at the time, I've always had it in me to want to do my executive MBA.
And that would have been probably four or five years ago now.
And at the time, I kept thinking like, how do I do this?
I'm working.
I have a good career.
I had a young son, probably five or six at the time.
How am I able to fulfill this dream of greater education and still be able to work?
And again, this is where I went to my boss and said to him, I really, really want to do this.
I don't know if I can.
I'm torn between I've got to do the program that takes 18 to 20 months.
I have to make sure work is taken care of from your perspective.
I have a son and a husband.
They need to be OK with this.
And what he was able to do for me in that case, and I graduated, I did my executive MBA.
I graduated in 2018.
He was, again, able to create the conditions where I was able to do the program.
He had done an MBA himself, which was great.
So he understood the program.
He provided a letter of recommendation as part of the selection process.
But what he also did is that he and I had set up a space or a system where if I needed the four days of the month to do the program, he was accommodating about that.
As long as I did my work and there was a balance between that, I was able to do the Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday studying.
And he went even so far to say, you know what?
Those are not days you necessarily, maybe I shouldn't share this, but you don't need to bank as vacation.
They're all part of your learning and development.
So a lot of companies would come to you and say, hey, you want to do this training for X amount of time?
That's on your time.
And so we had that sort of agreement that he would give me that time to do it.
And so right from the beginning, it was a comfortable situation where, again, that's allyship.
He was able to provide an environment and a system that worked.
And I made sure my end of the deal was I did my job.
I didn't miss my deadlines.
If I had to talk to him about that, I would.
I still did a lot of the traveling associated with it, but I still carved out time to do my MBA work.
And then also, you know, be a wife, a mother and everything else.
Like as a woman, you have to do in your life to keep everything sort of organized and going.

Christine Laperriere:
So this is such an interesting one because I'm curious, like when he provides an environment that you can take on something that's really important to you from a growth perspective, what did he get in return from you?

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Well, I think like doing your MBA program, what it really develops are a lot of sort of key areas for him in the business.
And I think I really felt like there was a whole new network that I was tapping into.
I think there was, you know, and him having done the program, recognizing there's a different approach in which you look at business, in which you sort of look at, it could be initiatives, project management, analysis.
And I think for him, it was, you know, she's going to come out of this having built an even better skill set and framework for the work that she wants to do and needs to do for me and for the company long-term.
I think it was more like not so much what he was going to get out of it, more so like recognizing what the potential was long-term, both for him and also the company.

Christine Laperriere:
But I think there's something even in addition to everything you just said, there's this thing about he has this star player and he gets engagement out of that.
Like he gets, you know, if you look, like employee engagement is so fascinating because lots of people, if they're really focused and really engaged, they can actually compress their work week pretty well.
The reason we're scared of compressing our work week is because we worry that disengaged employees are going to just start doing less work altogether.
But what's interesting is, you know, at the point that he is truly supporting your growth, you've kind of already invested in the growth of the business and supporting him as a leader.
So there's this mutual exchange where it's like, I'm going to make sure that you're successful.
You're going to make sure I'm successful.
And I think I'm just hearing that, like in the way that you tell the story, there's this commitment to one another because you're both out for the betterment of each other.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Yeah.
And I also, I really like what you said.
And I want to maybe expand upon that.
While doing my MBA and working and doing all the other stuff associated with, you know, life, I would look back on that time and say, was it a lot of work?
Yes.
But I think it was one of the more fulfilling times of my professional career.
And that's exactly to your point.
I felt like I was truly engaged, very focused on what I had to do.
And, you know, doing my professional development in parallel and working with the company really enhanced both of the experiences.
And I think to your point, like you make a brilliant point there is that we sometimes undercut that employee piece of it.
You know, companies look at it and say, sure, do your MBA, you know, what do I get out of it?
But I think that soft piece, which is happiness, focus, engagement, structure, those are things that I guess you could say from a business perspective, there's not like a hard ROI return on investment on them.
But to your point, if I'm like content engaged and I'm in there, oh, there's a big return on investment there because I'm going to do whatever you want me to do to make sure everything is done well and it's done successfully.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm listening to you and I'm smiling because I'm just thinking, you know, I'm sort of synthesizing what you said.
And it's like a mediocre leader kind of views it as a one-dimensional thing.
Okay, X number of hours out of the office, X number of hours you owe me back.
A best boss looks in three dimension, right?
And so they see that sure, there might be a time, maybe they don't win on the exact hour per hour exchange of time, but they win on the engagement, they win on the problem solving, they win on the way that you show up and think about the business.
They win on the type of role model that you're going to be to the rest of the organization.
So they're thinking in three dimension and they're going, I don't care so much whether, you know, if she doesn't exactly meet 7.5 hours on Fridays when she, you know, I'm more interested in, can I get that three-dimensional return from supporting her on this growth path?
And that's what it sounds like.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Absolutely.
And I think, you know, if people are listening, the best types of bosses look for that three-dimensional experience and that output because that is directly then correlated with, is the person you're managing or leading engaged?
Do they feel like they're being challenged?
Do you feel like you're really contributing to something?
And also, are you taking whatever you're learning and adding those skill sets in a way that maybe is completely different from before?
And again, those are the things that if you just look at, I guess in this case, you know, training or, you know, professional development, yeah, it's not just a, okay, they did the studying checkbox and got the paper certification or degree.
Those are all the pieces that over time you build a really effective group of leaders long-term.

Christine Laperriere:
So now this is a question that comes up often.
You know, I'm in the world of professional development and so there's always a question about what the return on investment is.
So, I mean, this is even a classic example right here.
You know, your EMBA was expensive, I'm sure.
And, you know, if you think of, what is the return on investment of working for a best boss?
Like, what does a business get at the bottom line when they have a leader like this leader that you worked for?

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Oh, for me is productivity.
And hard facts, it's like productivity.
You know that these people, if you really want to work for this boss, they're going to put in the time and the effort and the hours regardless.
I think on like, you know, more like the soft facts, I guess from a business perspective, it's like you have an engaged group of people or at least in my case, where you build trust, you build loyalty, and you build like an environment where you go, I like to work here, you know, and I want to be engaged.
And Christine, that's really hard to find, you know, and you've seen that with the pandemic and with people changing jobs and doing an assessment and reflecting on like, is this what I want to do and so forth.
Because that's really the ROI.
For me at the end of the day are those pieces as opposed to like the productivity.
Because if you have those pieces, the productivity will always come.
It works sort of in parallel with the trust, the loyalty, the engagement.
I'm content.
I feel like I'm part of something.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
That's great.
Let's talk about consistency again.
You were talking about during the pandemic, how much this idea of consistency started to shine through to you.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Yeah, absolutely.
Because I feel or what I sort of witness or experience is that, you know, really good bosses or leaders shine in times of crisis and a lot of chaos.
It's really easy to lead a company or a group of people or a project when things are going very well, right?
Of course, we can all be superstars that way.
But when things happen and then the context really of the pandemic for me, you know, that's where I started.
That was my aha moment about consistency was, it was really fascinating for me to explore and observe leaders and how consistent they were in a time where we had no information, no data.
Things could change tomorrow.
You know, you're running this and you're running that.
And I walked away, you know, two and a half years later going, it was very interesting to see the people that really, I would say, you know, Sean, like they really stepped up and leaned into the consistency and really led.
And then others that I was like, that was interesting to watch.
And that was for me, that's why I raised this notion of consistency.
You really see it in times of crisis.
And I think it's really good leadership grounding to find yourself in those situations and say, how would I react?
Like, do I consistently then lead?
And times where, honestly, there were moments during the pandemic, remember at the beginning, where we had no idea what was going on.
We were in lockdown mode.
We were all sitting in our houses going, is it the end of the world?
Is it not the end of the world?

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and I think, you know, you nailed it because that is that idea of consistency, right?
It's the knowing what I'm going to get and knowing how somebody is going to lead each day regardless of what's happening.
So the pandemic is a perfect example of, you know, all of a sudden the sky is falling, read the news, like, you know, it's like the world's going to hell.
And now you have to be a leader to people who are experiencing that type of fear, you know, fearing for their health and their families and things like that.
So going back to that idea, how you showed up in that moment, most leaders will really be a very memorable moment of whether they were consistent or not, whether they were empathetic, whether they were self-aware.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Yeah, I agree.
And I do, I really feel this word consistency is underrated or underplayed because I think people think it's more like a habit behavioral thing.
And I'm like, no, it's bigger than that.
It's really how you show up as a leader.

Christine Laperriere:
Now, what have you learned in your experience from not best bosses?
We all know what it's like to work for a boss that we will not title best boss ever.
And I'm just curious what experiences have you learned from those type of leaders?

Vasie Papadopoulos:
I think in my career, there are two areas I would focus on.
One is micromanagement.
I think that is really a symptom of leadership control.
And wanting to feel like you always have to micromanage or control things, really for most employees, or at least in my case, I've learned I shouldn't do that because it's really counterproductive in terms of how you want your employees to show up and deliver their work.
And so my key takeaway when I've had bosses like that was like, don't do that.
Don't feel like you have to control all elements of everything that's going on.
Give employees the ability to breathe and trust that they can do their jobs.
I think the second one for me, and I've learned some of the best bosses do this and some of the not great bosses do this is temperament and how you show up to people.
And the higher up you get, you really want to be a person that manages the ebb and flow of life, manages the ebb and flow of management and work.
And the ones that always had these temperaments that would just go up and down, up and down, that's a really hard environment to work in because you're always wondering who am I going to get today?
And so the takeaway from that, if I take it from what the worst boss was, was really working on being a leader is the opposite of that.
That having a consistent demeanor and temperament I think is really a skill and something that makes you over time a best boss versus a, I don't want it to be black and white versus the worst boss.
But those are really the two areas for me that I've either lived and experienced and then learned from it and taken from those experiences.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like what you just said.
I think this is a powerful point that I just want to drive home.
Consistency being a skill.
I just had an aha moment when you said that because when I'm working with leaders, just like you said, inconsistency is pretty easy, right?
You know, a good day, bad day, something's going on at home.
So, you know, to be inconsistent to your people, I mean, a lot of us probably don't even think twice about it, you know.
But if you have incredible emotional intelligence and self-awareness, which always seems to be the reason I get invited to the table, right?
It's like we need leaders with better self-awareness.
What you just said really reminds me of why that self-awareness and the emotional intelligence is so important because we're trying to build leaders that are consistent and trustworthy.
Just like you said, you need to know what you're going to get when you walk in the room that day.
And if you don't know, there's an added layer of stress and lost productivity that happens if you're trying to constantly anticipate what kind of mood is this leader going to be in this day?
Or how are they going to respond to this?
Are they going to respond poorly?
Are they going to respond well?
It's a lot of added, you know, pressure and stress.
So I really like what you said there as far as consistency being a skill.
I think you nailed it.
We don't talk about that a lot.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Well, and we don't talk about consistency enough in life either.
Like, you know, you get to be good at things because you're consistent.
Like, do you wake up around the same time every day?
Do you make your bed every day?
You know, do you do things a certain way?
And when you have that, I know those are small examples, but when you have that consistency, it does build that like, I call it like that muscle of who you are to then you end up doing it and you don't even think about it maybe five years down the road.
And so I work really hard to be consistent.
It's a hard skill, you know, but you have to really work at it.
It's not something that I think to your point, that we're always aware of, but it's like if we're consistent, at least maybe in temperament or approach or you're open with people to say, hey, you know what?
I'm probably not having a good day today.
Just know that and communicate it.
But at least you're then consistent to know that, you know, things maybe haven't bothered me the last three days, but I'm just not having a good day today.
And I really, I'm with you.
I think we don't focus on that at all in leadership and we get a lot of leaders in positions where they're really not consistent.

Christine Laperriere:
That's such a fantastic point.
I think for anybody that's listening, I feel like, you know, let's, you know, when you walk away, go spend some time asking yourself how consistent are you?
When's the last time you kind of lost it on somebody, you know, and how would you show up if you were going to show up more consistently?
I think that's a great question.
Very thoughtful for our group.
I guess from here, anything else you want to add to this topic before we start to wrap it up?

Vasie Papadopoulos:
No, I think, you know, if you do want to be a best boss long-term, it's really understanding people individually and where they come from and what their motivations are.
And I think some of the best bosses know, like, I'm a certain way from a leadership perspective.
I do things a certain way, but not everybody else does it.
And that's okay.
But then taking the time to understand, you know, why do they work this way?
Where does their motivation come from?
Like, what drives them every day?
And I think once you start to understand that, I think you over time start to become a really good boss.
You know, it takes a lot of self-awareness, but you have a sense of everybody and how they fit in and all of that.
Because I think sometimes, you know, Christine, in our heads, we think our leadership is the only leadership model or the only leadership way to do it.
And I've also learned, you know, in my career, that's not the case at all.
Just because Vassi does it a certain way does not mean anyone even remotely does it the way I do it.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great.
And then if you were going to give any words of wisdom to a leader who's really in the process of trying to become more like that best boss, like, what would you give them?
What tips or takeaways would you give them?

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Mine is really, really basic is listen to your people.
So if you create an environment where you are open to feedback, discussion, people challenging you, people raising things with you, you will become a better people manager and a better boss over time.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much.
This was amazing to get your perspective.
And I love the story of your best boss.
So thank you so much, Vasie.

Vasie Papadopoulos:
Thank you, Christine.

Title: Creating a fear-free workplace
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Matt Stone

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have on a guest, Matt Stone, he's joining us, and he got invited to the show through responding to a prompt on LinkedIn.
So Matt, thank you so much for responding.
That's gonna be a warning to everybody else that responds to my prompts on LinkedIn.
You may end up on the Best Boss Ever podcast.
So welcome, Matt.
Thank you so much for joining me.

Matt Stone:
Thank you, Christine.
It's really a pleasure to be on the podcast.
And it's a true warning.
If you respond to a Christine prompt online, it may put you in jeopardy of being on the podcast.
Be prepared.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right, I love that.
And can you introduce yourself just for everybody listening?

Matt Stone:
Sure, I've had a lot of different jobs, but almost a decade now, I don't know, it's eight, nine, 10 years or so, I've been leading, and now I'm the CEO of a company called Behavioral OS.
Its foundation was with an MIT organizational psychologist.
What I do and what we do is we work with executives to improve their performance and the performance of their teams through human strategies, what I call high growth conversations.
So focused on relationships, self-awareness, talking about the elephant in the room and showing that soft skills are actually quite hard.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, yes, you and I both, yes.
That is amazing.
Well, very cool.
So I'm gonna go right for the kill.
So who came to mind when you saw that prompt about best bosses?

Matt Stone:
It took me a minute, but not much more than that.
And I was thinking about it and I thought about a woman named Jan Margozian.
She's long since retired.
She was at the Oregon Department of Justice years ago when I lived in Oregon.
Actually, before I even went to law school, I worked there briefly in the consumer protection department or office, I don't recall.
And she was the head of all the people who would field consumer calls, basically, complaint calls and concern calls over business improprieties or conflicts or things like that.
She just stood out immediately, absolutely immediately.
And what came to mind was she was, for lack of a better word, she was just a badass.
Nice.
Powerhouse woman, a woman in leadership.
So as a man, I was very impressed with the way that she handled so many different personalities and types of people with incredible skill, but she was not, I mean, you might say a velvet hammer.
There wasn't always velvet on the hammer.
I mean, she could really hit you hard, but she was very effective for a number of reasons and I don't wanna just blather on.
I'd like to know from you what direction to go, actually, with that, because too many things come to mind.
So yeah, Jan Margosian is my short answer.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And so, yeah, I wanna hear about this.
So walk me through kind of the detail or the story.
Like, when you see her handling people, tell me how would Jan do it?
Give me an example.

Matt Stone:
The word I have to first come up with is authenticity.
Now, there's so many words that get thrown around.
That's one of them.
And then it gets thrown around so much that it loses its meaning.
But this is what it means in the context of Jan.
What she was thinking, what she was feeling and what she meant was exactly what she said and what she did.
So if she was angry with you, it was clear that she was angry.
What she wasn't doing was telling you that you were worthless.
What she was angry about was something that you did.
And she was going to then invest her time in correcting, informing, supporting, improving, whatever was called for, she was going to then take that step.
And I think that was actually a big differentiating factor.
This was a no shame leader.

Christine Laperriere:
Interesting.
A no shame leader.

Matt Stone:
There was no shame in her game.
She was not out to shame you.
She was out to do better, always.

Christine Laperriere:
So the point being like the frustration or whatever wasn't directed at you as a person, it was directed at the issue.

Matt Stone:
Never.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And so it still gives you space where you can make a mistake.
You know, she might get mad about the thing, but it sounds like you personally don't have to be shamed into existence for your mistake.

Matt Stone:
She was so good at communicating in a way that was shameless in a sense, shame free, I should say, that being barked at or even yelled at by your boss.
Now, I'm not saying she yelled a lot.
I don't remember her yelling a lot.
But if she raised her voice where she was critical of you, and I observed her with others and with myself, I remember not being in fear about anything.
It was like, oh, I mean, I might've felt disappointed.
Of course there's anxiety, but not that fear that I'm not enough, that I'm going to be punished somehow, that I'm a bad person and not worthy of this job or anything like that.
It was just that behavior wasn't the best behavior or we didn't get the right outcome and we're gonna fix this together and we're all gonna learn in the process.
And I'm gonna support you in doing that.
The first sign of support is by being very honest.
And by the way, not waiting weeks or months to tell you that.
It was now.

Christine Laperriere:
So it was in the moment.
This is really interesting.
I'm just listening for some of this.
So the feedback was in the moment.

Matt Stone:
In the moment.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
The feedback was also extremely direct.

Matt Stone:
Very.

Christine Laperriere:
There was a lot of this, we're in it together though.

Matt Stone:
100%.

Christine Laperriere:
We are fixing this together.

Matt Stone:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And we are gonna learn from this.

Matt Stone:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
It's very interesting.

Matt Stone:
She was capable of taking on data.
So she was usually right.
This was a person who had a lot of experience and wisdom.
She'd come out of PR, a PR background and some other things.
And so, and she was just whip smart.
So she understood what was going on usually.
And at the same time, I don't think I had any doubt that if there were some data that she didn't have that she would have been receptive to that.
So we were in it.
It was a mutual respect that we all belong at the table even if we throw food at each other from time to time.

Christine Laperriere:
But that sounds like that would drive performance.
So, I mean, I'm always curious, obviously I'm in a very, you know, same kind of business as you are.
So when you think of the impact of having a best boss, you know, I'm always getting asked the question around return on investment.
What's the impact of working for someone like a Jan?

Matt Stone:
Oh my goodness.
Okay.
So there's the impact on the, in that case, it's not a business.
So it's a government agency whose business is serving the people in a meaningful way but it was also serving businesses because better that the agency did in protecting consumers from fraud and abuse, the better that the business community in Oregon would do that there would be trust in the businesses in Oregon that even a business that had a complaint if it's handled well, now that business's brand is actually improved because if the business cooperates and maybe there's an honest mistake, businesses are people made up of people who make mistakes doesn't mean a complaint does not equal much like her leadership style, a complaint about a business does not equal a bad business necessarily.
It's how they handle it.
And so I think the end result performance was, do we have a better, more ethical business consumer relationship in this state?
And I saw direct impact from that.
So the performance in terms of, you know, our complaints getting resolved, our consumers being protected and made whole when they are damaged in some way.
I think as far as an organization, if I were to project her leadership style, if you will, and her skills, that almost doesn't do it justice leadership style.
It was deep skill in communication at a human level.
I would say if it were a business and you were worried about retention, having a boss like Jan means you're going to have incredible retention and recruiting power because here I am, I mean, how many years later?
I mean, this has gotta be, I'm looking back now, it must have been at least 25 years ago.
I don't know the exact year.
It was a long time ago.
And I'm still talking about her, using her as a model when I evaluate other leaders.
And when I think about my decisions as a leader, I still think of her as this model.
So it's hard to really quantify the impact of one person like that.
I have to say, I think in terms of the lingering brand of that agency and that department for me, even though she's long gone from there, is that I have a positive image because of her.
So we love data, but stories are data too.
I think that in terms of in the brand world, and I've worked in the branding world as well, when you create an emotional positive connection with an entity because of positive interactions with people, it's almost hard to put a value on that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, that physical, what that feels like for other people that have this perception of a positive brand.

Matt Stone:
Exactly, and I saw it.
I saw it with consumers who were complaining and her impact on helping them get at least clarity.
Sometimes there was nothing that you could do.
And the best you could do, which wasn't really true because by nothing you can do, meaning you may not be able to make someone financially whole because they were a party to a transaction in which they both had responsibility and the consumer made a bad choice.
And in that case, what you can do is be compassionate.
You can listen, you can give them clear information and not overstep.
Sometimes the mistake you make in a place like that is saying the wrong thing to the person, leading them astray, for example.
So Jan was very good.
Her PR background helped with this, being clear in your messaging.
Clarity is kindness.

Christine Laperriere:
Clarity is kindness, yes.

Matt Stone:
Right, so just being very, very clear.
And sometimes the resolution was the person's like, I have clarity now that I'm not gonna get the money I wanted to get back and I see my responsibility in it and I accept the reality now and I'm glad you informed me.
That was a positive outcome actually.

Christine Laperriere:
To feel that they were complete with their complaint.

Matt Stone:
Absolutely, I learned this way back my first job out of undergrad for like a pager company when cell phones were coming on.
So it wasn't exactly a high growth business.
That's right.
Meeting my quota every month was pretty tough.
And I remember the billing person who was this just, she was the sweetest woman on the planet and she answered all these awful billing questions and I remember her telling me how she would handle it and she would just really listen to people and she would care for them as human beings about how they felt about their bill.
So many times it's the bill that they owed.
I mean, it wasn't actually us.
They were upset and so just giving them space and validity that they were upset.
So often resolved the problem.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow, that's brilliant.
Now, when we first started talking, you said that another leader came to mind a very quick run in with a great leader.

Matt Stone:
Yeah, he was the vice president of a company I worked for briefly in a startup.
The name is Terry.
Terry's still active.
I might even tag him on this at some point.
Terry Ravnak, if you're out there, I think he's in California now, I'm not sure.
He was really, really incredible.
And one of the things that I really respected about him was again, another clear communicator.
He was working in a difficult situation.
Terry was willing to tell you what was holding you back.
And in my case, it was the way I was communicating with particularly one person.
He gave me this incredible feedback one time and he said, look, I see big things for you and here's what I see for you.
Here's the vision.
So he started with an inspire kind of flow which worked really well for me.
It wouldn't necessarily work for everyone.
We're all different, different circumstances.
He was very attuned to sort of what was important to me.
And he said, one of the things you're going to need to do is you're going to need to figure out how to have a good relationship with this person.
Whatever that takes, figure it out.
In this case, did he offer me a whole lot of support in how to do it?
No, but that actually, and this is where platitudes can fall short.
We gotta be aware of the guru platitude posting syndrome.
It's contextual.
In this case, that was the perfect thing to say to me.
Right.
He knew I was capable of figuring that out.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, you didn't need him.
He just needed to tell you, this will hold you back.

Matt Stone:
I needed clarity and accountability with some inspirational cinnamon sugar on top.
So I knew what I was going to be, that there was a beautiful future.
He saw the goodness and capability in me.
This was something that was going to prevent that from winning the day and allowing me to be my best self and reach my potential.
It was fantastic.
I'll never forget the way he communicated.
Again, we were working very challenging, volatile situation.
And Terry just handled so many difficult situations with grace, kindness.
I'll never forget him.
He's a great guy.
Great boss.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
Can you think of an example?
I can hear some of the feedback, obviously, that he gave you when you're talking about some of those difficult situations.
Any other kind of different memories that come to mind?

Matt Stone:
About Terry specifically, I can think of just there were conflict issues while I was there and even after I was there.
And I remember thinking there was a dispute that I had with the company after I left.
And he was representing the company on the other side.
And what's interesting was, I was quite upset about something.
And as upset as I was, I was never upset with him.
He was doing his job.
And I knew that he'd be a person in my universe that I'd have a relationship with if I wanted to forever.
And that there was just a healthy human respect there.
And I think that's what so many of us out there are trying to cultivate in our own spheres of influence and work is that actually conflict is an incredible opportunity for growth.
Incredible.
Absolutely.
Sometimes it reveals something in me that I need to resolve, it usually does.
Sometimes my end result is, okay, I see that it's rooted in something that I'm not willing to live with, but it always reveals if I'm paying attention.
And so I think that was the other thing comes to mind is just his ability to manage himself through conflict in a way that was so dignified.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic.
These are both great stories.
And I'm hearing kind of that reoccurring theme of they don't forget the human element, right?
It seems like that human element stays a priority in the conflict, in the difficult moment, in the moment which somebody screws up on the team.
I just hear over and over again, it's like we're staying focused on resolving the conflict, not painting the person with a brush, right?
Or making it personal.
They knew how to protect that.

Matt Stone:
That's right.
I mean, it's probably to trite is the word, I think, that you need to figure out how to best leverage what is.
And to put it in non jargony speak, accept it.
And work to change what you can, but okay, this is the circumstance at this moment.
I'm going to make the most of it.
It may be less than ideal by a mile or kilometers, depending on where you're at, but really coming into acceptance and included in that acceptance is that I, I might have some growth opportunity here as well.
As dug in as I am about my position or a resentment or the threat I feel, it's possible that this may be a growth opportunity for me if I'm willing to look at myself, which is not always easy to do.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great.
And I just have to ask when you say best leverage what is, are you a Byron Katie fan?

Matt Stone:
I could be, I don't know.

Christine Laperriere:
You have to look.
She wrote a book called Loving What Is, and that's what I thought you were calling out there.
I was like.

Matt Stone:
Yes, I am, of course.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.
That's exactly where it came from.
She has the same exact philosophy is like learning to accept what is and really work with that instead of trying to hope for something that is not currently available.
And sometimes conflict has that, you know, it's like we get fixated on wanting something to be different than it is.
And we can't get past that.

Matt Stone:
And I love that.
And what's coming to mind is sometimes when I'm, if it's my small self working, I would rather blow it up to get the definitive results and finality of it than deal with the struggle of letting it just be and go on and give it time or me to grow and heal and resolve and whatever I need to work through and for whatever other situation or other people to do their own, you know, to do their own process.
So yeah, that's a really good point.
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.
So now if you were to just go to the bosses that did not stand out, let's say on the list of favorites, I'm curious, what's your experience been there?
Like what are the things that, you know, really didn't work for you?

Matt Stone:
Well, first and foremost is lies.

Christine Laperriere:
Yep.

Matt Stone:
I mean, that's just so foundational.

Christine Laperriere:
It sounds foundational, but everybody in business knows somebody who's done that before.

Matt Stone:
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it's a standard operating procedure of many, of many, unfortunately.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So it sounds obvious, but it's not obvious, obviously.

Matt Stone:
Well, maybe obvious isn't the right word, right?
I mean, to the extent that humans are economic animals, you know, we are driven by incentives and there are people who are promoted in spite of, or because of, listen, I don't know about you, I've come across far too many situations of executives who were promoted at least once or more times to move them from a place rather than to a place.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.

Matt Stone:
So we then put a cherry on, oh, well, we can't upset this person, but they're leaving dead bodies behind them.
So let's move them to another place.
And the bigger the organization, the more options you have, so you can spread the toxins around.
And so the feedback loop that that person is getting is that they're great.
Yep.
It's not only not fair to all the people that come encounter with that person who is not fully realized in their maturity, but that you're robbing them of the ability to have accountability.
I recently fired a personal trainer.
He was relatively new.
I thought that he might have the skills to do it, but he showed up late twice.
The first time he showed up late, I made it very clear to him that a priority for me was that I was gonna meet him and pay a significant amount of money and time that I expected him to show up early and that I too would show up early and actually warm up and prepare so that we could maximize that hour that we had together.
Because for me, the exercise is part of my job.
It's part of my performance.
And he showed up late a second time and I was not going to talk to him about it.
I was not going to, we're not gonna have any kind of conversation.
You fired yourself.
That's what I told him.
And he wanted another chance and there was a reason why.
It doesn't matter.
It's always a reason.
Right, it's always a reason.
And I said, so now I'm not gonna go around the gym and bad mouth you, but you deserve early on in your quote unquote entrepreneurial, I'm a trainer mode, you deserve accountability so that you will always remember this day when your client told you, you were fired at a bench press and you will never forget it.
And I doubt you're gonna be late again.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, you delivered him a favor whether he knows it or not.

Matt Stone:
I didn't tell him he was a worthless trainer.
I didn't tell him that he had no future.
So you're gonna do great with other clients and you're gonna do great in part because I was honest with you today.
And I draw that from experience that I had with leaders like Jan and Terry.
So I can't give away what I don't have.
And people like that and other friends in my life, people that I have, have taught me what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that kind of message.

Christine Laperriere:
So you, and you know, like there's gratitude in it even though it doesn't feel great in the moment.

Matt Stone:
Yeah, he wasn't happy.

Christine Laperriere:
No, usually most of us aren't when we're getting that tough message.
But I would agree with you that so many leaders that I talked to remember the tough feedback that they got and they were grateful for it down the road.

Matt Stone:
So that's it.
So I go back to lies.
And I think there's other things that we all know and experience.
But first and foremost, telling the truth.

Christine Laperriere:
I think the lies, it's so interesting when you say that because you're even referring to not so much the individual that has the problem with being honest.
You're talking about the entire organization that can't be honest with the individual.
And I think that's really interesting.

Matt Stone:
If an organization in my view, in my experience, if an organization has leaders who lie and leaders who lie and manipulate, but manipulates one thing.
I mean, that's tricky.
What's manipulation?
What's influence?
Can get to a point where they're binary.
That's actually one of those things where I can objectively determine if something was a lie.
I know, because I'm a former lawyer and you can determine whether or not something is a lie.
Did they consciously know the truth and say the alternative?
And we know from our society that people lie a lot.
So if an organization promotes and nurtures leaders who knowingly misrepresent truth about small things, about big things, then I don't need to know, I don't need to know much more data about the company to know what's going to happen eventually.
It may take a while, but it's just a matter of time.
You are corrupted.
It's just a matter of time.
That's the only data I need.
So to me, it sort of begins and ends with truth.
If I'm someone who's not very, if I'm prickly and I'm not very honestly, I can work with someone who's not full of empathy.
I just need them to care at some level enough about me to tell me the truth.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.
That is good.
And you've obviously experienced that in both directions.

Matt Stone:
Oh yeah.
Haven't we all?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely.
Oh, I was going to say, I can think of so many situations that match up with this.
And then, I guess to me, any other wisdom that you would give, I've got so many leaders who are aspiring to be amazing bosses and they're listening to this show.
So tell me, do you have words of wisdom for them just as we come to wrap this up?

Matt Stone:
We hear a lot of words like empathy, even feedback is meaningless until you give it a real depth.
I've described what it means for me in these contexts, but it means nothing unless you're talking about the context of things.
So relying on platitudes for leadership is, we're just buried in information is not where it's at.
It's really, so even authenticity, it's like, okay, yes, be authentic, but keep searching for what it means to you.
Why, we talk about Simon Sinek got famous with asking about your why.
And that's really important.
When it comes to self-awareness in these kinds of conversations, often asking what, not why can be actually more powerful.
And Tasha Urick, my friend, who's just an amazing practitioner and brilliant author and researcher has a TED talk on this, ask what, not why.
Fantastic, recommend watching that.
But really get feedback, develop an environment where you have people who will tell you the truth because the higher up people go, the harder it is for them to get the truth.
You have to work hard.
If there's a graph, it's like the higher up I am, the more I have to work to get honest feedback.
I have to really convince people that it is truly not only safe, I have to incentivize people to give me.
So that means I find people who will give me the truth.
I really listen to it.
I take it in, I process it.
It may not be actually valid for me.
It may be more about them than me, but I take it in and I follow up.
And one of the best ways to start learning how to do that is through just the easy, well, the so-called easy one, which is when people help you or giving praise or how you receive praise.
So start with the positive to get more comfortable with that kind of direct dialogue.
And then you will build a relationship, number one, built on, it's very hard for people to give praise, really, other than, you know, attaboy or, you know, it's like- 

Christine Laperriere:
Like deep, genuine praise.

Matt Stone:
Like genuine, yes.
So you practice, what is it that you appreciate about a particular colleague of yours specifically and why, and what did it mean to you?
And go that second level and say, hey, Christine, I wanna explain to you what it meant when you stepped in for me at that meeting last week.
I noticed that you changed the presentation for the better that you gave.
I gave you that template.
And here's the feedback I got from other people.
And this is what it means to me, and frankly to us at this point where we can move forward.
Like giving that full, and then your job as a leader is to be able to take it and not deflect.

Christine Laperriere:
That's probably equally as hard, yes.

Matt Stone:
So both of us have this role.
So whatever role you're in receiving or giving, go all in on it.
That's an opportunity to get comfortable having direct dialogue that's open and it's vulnerable to do that.
Then when you and I have an issue that we need to resolve between us, guess what foundation we're gonna have.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, rock solid, yep.

Matt Stone:
Rock solid.
I'm still gonna be nervous.
That just shows I care, but I'm gonna be able to either receive that criticism from you, or I'm gonna be able to deliver a message that's hard to deliver, and with more trust that you're gonna know that I'm not attacking you as a person.
That's what we gotta do in every organization, in every community, at the government level is facilitate, number one, people who are willing to do that work into those leadership roles and then providing the incentives and support for them to do that difficult stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
Listen, that was so good that I'm gonna wrap right there.
I think you gave everybody some really amazing feedback there.
That's like a mic drop moment, so I'm not gonna mess with it too much.
That's right, don't drop your mic out.
Don't drop your mic.
Thank you, Matt.
That was amazing and so insightful, and I have a feeling lots of people are gonna be thinking about the what, not the why, thinking a little bit about their own authenticity.
I loved how you talked about shame and shameless leadership.
I think that's a brilliant idea for so many of us to think about.
And then this last but not least, just kind of how you build a foundation of trust so you can have real conversation, real feedback, and kind of what that really means.
So loved it.
Thank you so much, Matt.

Matt Stone:
Thank you.
It's been just a pleasure to spend some time with you today.

Title: It's okay to be perfect
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jon Cogan

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have John on the show.
John reached out, actually, through LinkedIn, and we have started a connection.
So it was pretty exciting to get an opportunity to sit down with him today.
John, introduce yourself really quick to everybody that's listening.

Jon Cogan:
Thanks so much.
Thanks for having me.
I'm John Kogan, a marketing veteran, sad to say at this point, about 20 years on the agency side.
I've recently started my own consultancy, fractional marketing and consultancy practice, just in the last few months.
And it was through that journey getting set up that I reached out to you and glad to have made that connection.
Working closely, I've worked quite a bit in the health care sector.
So working closely now, not just the health care companies, but companies in heavily regulated, highly constrained sectors and really trying to help them kind of bring an innovative and creative lens to their marketing practice, which can often feel kind of boxed in and constrained, but, you know, which often leads to some of the best ideas and best work and trying to bring that to life and tap into that.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it.
I'm sure there's people who definitely would love your help.
I hear that.

Jon Cogan:
Hopefully.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Well, listen.
OK, so I'm going to dive right in.
Who is the best boss that you've ever worked for?

Jon Cogan:
So as I was just telling you, I'm taking a bit of a cop out approach here.
I think for good reason.
And I'm going to stick with two.
But one was my first boss very beginning of my career and I think was the perfect boss for that moment in my life and my career.
And one was one of the more recent bosses that I had in a more senior leadership position, who I think was the perfect kind of pragmatist and realist to kind of help guide me along and maybe maybe to help quell some of the ego and comfort level that starts to creep in, especially as you get more advanced in your career.
So I'll start with the former.
When I first started, you know, as we all do, it's all about kind of gaining confidence, gaining traction.
And this boss named Dan was incredible at what I'll say, believing in me more than I believe to myself and not just me.
I think a number of people on his team.
And I think it's that belief that really elevated not only my performance, but the performance of the organization.
And I think what he realized at a very practical level was that small failures were easy to recover from.
And so obviously, when you kind of put people out on the limb and let them stretch maybe beyond where they think they're initially capable of stretching to, you're going to have some broken branches and some missteps.
But ultimately, you're going to succeed a lot more than you fail.
And you're going to easily recover from those failures.
And I think learning to kind of operate without fear really came from that, came from him, came from the fact that he not only believed in me when I succeeded, believed in me when I failed, helped me recover from those failures, took the blame for those failures, deflected the credit for the successes.
So it was really just that sense of confidence and comfort.
And I would say limberness.
I always equate things to sports.
You'll see I use a lot of athletic analogies.
And I think when you see the best players, there's a certain limberness and looseness to how they operate on the field or ice or whatever surface versus the players that maybe a little tighter, a little more almost like taut and restrictive in their movement.
And I think the way he operated in conversations with clients and conversations internally with our team, with me, there was just this kind of readiness for any curveball or any situation that might come up.
And I think I learned that that really came from him being comfortable not only in his own skin, but comfortable that any problem can be managed and that it's OK to be imperfect, especially early on in the career.
I came out of business school.
There's a real standard of almost a false ego.
I don't want to say is part of a business school education, but it's often a byproduct at times.
So to kind of get a little bit of humility and a realization that you can succeed and that you can stretch beyond what you think is possible was a huge shot in the arm early on in my early 20s.

Christine Laperriere:
So give me some examples, too, of like, what did that look like?
I mean, I'm sure, you know, he gave you some challenging assignments, but what did he do when you did mess things up?
Like, give me some example.

Jon Cogan:
Well, first of all, he he made himself extremely approachable.
So it almost became a point where I wasn't worried about letting him know if something went wrong.
I was almost excited.
I better talk to Dan about this because he's going to help fix it.
There was never going to be this sense of fear or judgment.
So that that was helpful.
I think there were just a number of situations where if I was, you know, as like a 23, 24 year old at a pre-junior level working behind the scenes, when I was explaining a concept to him or how, you know, this was early 2000s and, you know, we were doing a lot of analytics work on websites that were pretty new at the time, dating myself now.
And as I was kind of explaining to him how, for example, a website was performing based on, you know, the early forms of Google Analytics, at some point he was just like, well, you don't need to explain it to me.
You'll come to the client meeting.
I'll explain it to everybody.
And so that was it was almost like here.
Why go with this broken telephone approach?
You know, you're perfectly capable of articulating this.
You'll join us in the meeting.
So all of a sudden I find myself kind of, I'll say, punching above my weight class, to use another sports analogy, where I get to be in the room and I'm there, you know, I'm there to deliver this one particular point.
But now I'm in the meeting with the full team and I'm getting to, you know, learn by osmosis and pick up what's going on and kind of get to know the dynamic at more senior levels.
And so it was invaluable learning.
And I've said to many people, if there's one piece of advice, it comes from that, which is become an expert on one thing that maybe your boss or your colleagues aren't quite as adept at, because that's going to get you into a lot of rooms that you might otherwise not get into.
But it takes a certain level of vulnerability and humility from that leader as well to accept that and to believe and empower young team members.

Christine Laperriere:
That's a great piece of advice, though, for a new team member.
And just like you said, if you have a good manager who's willing to let you be that expert and let you have a voice.
Now you've got a reason to be in the meeting.

Jon Cogan:
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
And the other leader now that you mentioned.

Jon Cogan:
So he brought me into Tank Worldwide, which is a company I worked for for the better part of the last four years before starting my own practice.
And he's the ultimate pragmatist.
And I've said this to him many times.
Unbelievable balance of compassion, but absolute fearless bluntness that I admire and aspire to.
And what I noticed pretty quickly, because he was based in Montreal and would travel, I was leading the Toronto operation for Tank.
And he would travel to meet with me.
But every time he would come into Toronto, he'd have a lunch and a coffee and several other sessions, it seemed, with various people based in Toronto.
And it was almost was collecting protege that he had so many people that had worked for him over the years in his various roles as a leader that still wanted to stay in touch, kind of tap into his wisdom, his compassion, his encouragement.
And even though I was just getting to know him at the time, I started to realize, wow, that's an impressive quality.
That's a nice barometer that do the people that you have kind of led or worked with or collaborated with still want to keep in touch and keep up that relationship long after your business relationship ends.
And in his case, that was clearly the case.
And it's the case for me with him right now.
He left Tank about a year and a half ago and we've kept in touch.
And he's been incredibly helpful, especially the last several months.
Why is that the case?
I think it's a combination of, like I said, that comfort in his own skin, that vulnerability and humility to be both compassionate and truly caring, but also incredibly direct.
But there was also a certain pragmatism.
But really, that's what it is.
And I'd say realism where he was the first leader to say to me, look, you know, you've got your strengths and you've got your challenge areas or weaknesses or whatever term you want to use.
You don't necessarily have to fix the weaknesses.
You're not going to become great at everything.
You need to just own them and you need to be aware of them and understanding of them and understanding of the impact they have on yourself and on other people so that you can A, surround yourself with people that help to balance that and B, mitigate the impact that they have and just be honest and humble about that.
And so that was the first kind of and again, I'm 43 years old.
I guess I was probably about 40, 41 at the time.
And it was great to hear that because I think you want to either A, try to act like you're perfect in some cases or really try to fix what those flaws are.
And it's freeing in a way to say, well, I don't I'm not probably not going to be able to fix some of these flaws at this point.
But if I can acknowledge them and own them and try to mitigate them, but also just be honest and humble and vulnerable at them, you can continue to operate and you can continue to, again, surround yourself with teammates and leaders that help to bring the best out of one another until you kind of own what you're best at and what maybe you're not as adept at.
It's very hard to do that.
So I think he really brought that out, not just for me, but from the entire organization.
I think that, you know, created quite a bit of, to use a buzzword, synergy within the leadership group, for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
So getting people to really own the strengths and the weaknesses and be fully kind of immersed in how do you orient yourself given what you know, that's that's actually pretty insightful when you think about it, because typically people either heavily focus on strength or they heavily focus on weakness.
And we kind of leave it to the manager a lot of the times to figure out how to find the synergies.
But if you get everybody really involved in that, it would change the way you'd operate.

Jon Cogan:
For sure.
And he led by example.
Like he he fully owned what he was best at and what he wasn't as adept at or experienced with.
I don't know that it would work if he was perfect, you know, or or carried himself that way.
And he certainly didn't.
Anything else you want to share about either of these leaders?
I think the one part that both of them possessed and again, it came from just being genuine and authentic and comfortable and who they were is that and I've used this from vulnerability a couple of times, but that ability, because they had that foundation of genuine care that they established, they could be as direct and cutting and blunt as needed.
They didn't need to sugarcoat because I knew they care and I knew that it was coming from a place of constructive feedback.
We didn't have to waste time sugarcoating and and dancing around some difficult conversations.
It was they were both extremely blunt and sometimes in a way that was jarring, but mostly in a way that was super easy to kind of digest because you knew it was coming from a genuine place.
And so that's something I've really, you know, it's hard to have hard conversations.
The word hard is right in there.
And, you know, I've tried to get better at establishing that foundation up front so that you can, with as little waste as possible, get right into, you know, the difficult conversations that inevitably are going to come up in any, you know, any relationship.

Christine Laperriere:
That's an ongoing theme.
So if you listen to the, you know, 60 some episodes, there is this reoccurring theme that shows up around how people have the right to give difficult feedback.
And it always comes back from a base of the person knew they cared, like they knew they cared about them personally.
And then the difficult feedback was easy to deal with.
And so there's just this reoccurring theme because you hear, you know, leaders give difficult feedback and then they they hurt people in the process and they don't know why.
But if they don't have that base of that person knowing that they care about them and that's the purpose of their one feedback, it's like, you know, that's the game changer.

Jon Cogan:
Yeah.
And there's also nothing worse than finding out in some indirect way that your boss or colleague or leader felt a certain way, but wasn't expressing it if it doesn't come out in a direct way.
And I've had colleagues, peers, one I'm friends with, who I no longer work with.
But we joke about the fact that, you know, we have heated conversations, intense conversations.
But it was because we had the ability to just be blunt with each other.
And ultimately, that led to a good trusting relationship, even if we, you know, got on each other's nerves and aggravated each other at times.
But that's healthy.
And, you know, to a certain extent, I think it was because of that honesty that that could thrive.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that's amazing.
Now, if you think of some of the bosses that weren't titled your best boss, what comes to mind when you think of some of those people that you've worked with?

Jon Cogan:
Yeah.
So there's a wide spectrum.
I'll go all the way to the far end of it, because there's one in particular that I'm thinking of.

Christine Laperriere:
Who did not win the best boss ever acknowledgement.

Jon Cogan:
No, unfortunately that and, you know, God bless this individual.
But yeah, in my opinion, was not the greatest boss ever.
Well, one, I mean, there's so many things I've already talked about and you just flip it.
So, you know, I talked about deflecting credit and taking blame.
This is someone who deflected all the blame and took all the credit, was always preaching about how she was the hardest working person in the organization, which is really not what your hardworking team wants to hear.
I was at a, you know, I guess a VP level and she was an executive VP level on the senior team.
And it always felt like she saw our team members as almost like checkers pieces, as a as a quantity of hours, as opposed to human beings with a quality of time that we were privileged for them to be offering to us, as opposed to the other way around.
It just felt like, you know, we're worrying about surface level details like when they arrive and leave, which again, we, you know, we talked about, you know, it was a lot of conversations back in our day.
We used to work 60 hour, 70 hour weeks to get the work done.
I said, well, nobody was telling us we had to.
We did that because we had a sense of ownership and pride that was instilled by having great leaders.
And we took that on ourselves to do that when it was necessary.
A, maybe it wasn't healthy to do it as much as we did.
B, we did it because we had a personal sense of pride, not because someone told us we need to be doing that.
And I just felt like and I know she agreed, but I just felt like it didn't manifest in the way she treated people.
Also, I just never felt a sense of curiosity from this person.
And that, I don't know, that maybe is just a personal issue I had.
I always feel like if I ever kind of stop wanting to learn at that point, I don't, you know, probably want to find something else to do because life could get pretty boring.
And then there was one story in particular that really, I think, exemplifies kind of maybe a lack of, I don't know, humility or honesty or authenticity.
And it was we had at the organization, we had decided to eliminate the receptionist role at the time, which was common amongst many organizations.
And I think the person who had been working in that role was doing more office management work, but we still had a reception desk.
We hadn't yet renovated the office space.
So we had this empty reception desk at the front and we had a client coming in for a pitch or an advertising agency.
We had a client coming in and we had one of our junior team members.
She had assigned one of our junior team members to sit at the reception desk to pretend that we had a receptionist there.
And the first on a very practical level, I don't know how that made sense.
If we do win this business, are we going to have to have this person sitting there every time they come in now?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Right.
Right.

Jon Cogan:
We weren't really thinking ahead very well.
Many companies don't have a receptionist.
It's OK.
We could also just be kind of standing there to welcome them.
We knew approximately when they were planning to arrive.
But most importantly, well, two parts.
One, think of how humiliating that is for a junior team member who's bringing so much value to the organization and is now told they have to fake being a stand in as a receptionist.
Not that, you know, there's anything wrong with being a receptionist, but that's not the role this person had.
And number two, just the first interaction with this new potential client is a dishonest one is one that we're we're trying to fake something that we're not.
And regardless of how small and minute detail it was, it just felt like, is that really the footing we want to get off on?
And I just I didn't want to be part of that.
And that just spoke volumes to me about a certain level of insecurity that we all we all have to some extent that I felt like crossed the line in many ways.
And so that that's a story that stuck with me as, you know, just don't do that.

Christine Laperriere:
What people, I think, forget sometimes is like, quote unquote, those worst bosses.
It's chuck full of micro, what do you want to call it, microaggressions or micro decisions?
I mean, every once in a while, there's obviously this terrible person that steals money from the business and launders it or something.
Right.
It was like they're kind of like the obvious ones.
They're like, you know, we watch Netflix shows with people and I'm kind of playing the same role.
But but the the not good bosses, the ones that don't turn into like some kind of theater.
It's these micro these little decisions, these little calls that like rub people the wrong way.
And it's not just one.
It's one after another, after another, after another.
And it's like, like you said, it's like when she, you know, pontificate that she's the hardest working person in the room.
Well, then everybody else in the room feels like, are we not hardworking?
Like, you know, but it's like, just like what you said, it's like this list of these micro little tiny minute things where one of those things wouldn't be a game changer.
But each day, another one and another one and another one starts to really send that message home.
And that example about, you know, the receptionist role.
Like, again, it's not game changing, but it just feels so inauthentic that you just pair that up with more inauthenticity.
That's disengaging.

Jon Cogan:
100 percent agree.
There was also we had a great employee leave the company, which was unfortunate.
We had a great opportunity elsewhere.
And I don't know, two, three months later, this was someone who was still a friend of mine.
Two, three months later, she told me she was pregnant.
So I happened to be talking to this boss and said, oh, by the way, great news.
So and so is pregnant.
And her immediate reaction was bullet dodged.
And I said, well, I was thinking more isn't that nice.
Congratulations on a human level.
You know, her thought immediately went to, well, at least we don't have to deal with the whole mat leave situation, etc.
And which is, again, as a practical matter, something that, you know, when you're in the advertising world and the majority of your team members are 25 to 40 some odd.
The majority, you know, more than 50 percent tend to be female.
You're going to be dealing with that.
But for that to be the immediate reaction as opposed to, oh, isn't that amazing?
It was striking to me.
So another I don't want to pile on, but that was another example.
Microaggression, as you said, it is.

Christine Laperriere:
It's those little examples, though, where you just go, wow, you know, you really do see us as hours logged and not as humans that are we have more dimension to us.
Right.

Jon Cogan:
That was my perception of it.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's the way it lands with you.
Right.
Since I'm in the business of leadership development, I'm always getting challenged with what's the return on investment for working for a great boss versus a not great boss.
And so people always want numbers and cents.
And that's actually very hard to do.
But I'm curious, like if I ask you, what's the return on investment for a business to have a best boss versus a not best boss?
What do you think?

Jon Cogan:
Well, I think like we talked about, people aren't checkers pieces and they're not, you know, just a quantity of hours.
And I think the best bosses bring out the best quality in those people for the obvious point.
But so from an effect, I think there's an effectiveness element to it and an efficiency element from an effectiveness standpoint.
I think both bosses I alluded to and there's others other great ones along the way.
I felt like every time I have a conversation with them, I felt feeling better about myself and about the situation.
And I feel like I performed at a higher level, let's say 110 percent versus 90 percent because of their belief in me and their pragmatism and helping to solve problems.
And so you multiply that by all the people in the organizations, both at leadership levels and all the way across.
You know, obviously, you're obviously getting a high performing group of people.
So that, you know, there's the obvious effectiveness angle.
From an efficiency standpoint, I remember one example when the first boss I alluded to, Dan, became the president of the organization.
At one point, the first kind of all staff meeting he had, he said, Look, I'm asking everyone here and all at all levels to question everything we're doing, not in a disrespectful way and not in a wasteful way, but to just be willing to question every process, every step, every every operation, because we don't have visibility to everything that everybody does every day, but you do.
So question if you don't feel it makes sense, question it politely and respectfully.
You might be told, oh, this is why we're doing it.
We're going to continue to do it.
But we may find two, three, four processes, operational details that we can fix because of those questions.
Sure enough, we did.
And we, in the span of maybe two or three months, probably cut about 10% from our cost base, just from finding efficiencies by just empowering everybody to feel a sense of ownership.
There was a certain approachability now in that president's chair where anybody felt, OK, I can go and talk directly about this small, minute problem.
Again, most of them were not major factors, but there were two or three that led to significant cost savings.
So from a pure business sense, just that sense of empowerment increased profitability for the company right away.
And so that's, I think, one practical example where just being open and approachable makes a huge difference.

Christine Laperriere:
That's a great example.
Those are the impact of everybody operating at their A game and being fully transparent when they do see something that doesn't make sense.
There's huge value in that.
It's just hard to convince people what the difference is.
So I think that's great.
Now, knowing that I've got an audience of leaders out there that are aspiring to be best bosses or great bosses, what would be some of your words of wisdom to them just as we wrap this up?

Jon Cogan:
I think, going back to a lot of the points, I think certainly one thing is always, and this is a pet peeve of mine, when people use the word I and my a lot versus we and our.
I think no matter who actually took care of a certain task, just always speaking in we and our is a huge way to set the right tone for organizational or team culture.
So that's a little detail.
Like I talked about earlier, just believing in people, giving them a chance, being comfortable enough that if they do have a misstep or a quote unquote failure, that sometimes with clients or others, the recovering from that is actually more positively impactful than just swimming along as if everything's perfect.
So being okay with that and letting people kind of go out on a limb and take a chance because it's gonna work wonders long-term to elevate that individual.
I think owning strengths and weaknesses that you talked about, being okay with being imperfect is super important, not having to pretend that everything's perfect and being vulnerable and recognizing that your style may not mesh with everybody on your team as well as others.
And so making sure you're still creating a sense of comfort and openness to that because I've had that myself.
I tend to be a little more improvisational, maybe a little less structured, which can be a tremendous strength, but with certain people, that also creates a sense of discomfort because of that missing maybe structure or parameter.
And so making sure you can provide that when it's needed, but also being open to the fact that that's gonna be a source of tension.
I think it's important.
You're not gonna be able to be perfect, but just being humble enough to proactively manage those sources of tension I think is important.
I think it's important not to feel like you're the smartest person in the room.
I think that you're not surrounding yourself with the right people if they don't know more than you do in most cases.
You wanna bring people in that are smarter than you, that you can learn from.
And it may not be that they're smarter or more capable in every aspect of a job or business, but at least in some, if not all, think if you're not learning from the people around you in all directions, that's a problem.
And there's a certain level of humility that's I think required.
And then lastly, kind of reiterating an earlier point, I think establishing that foundation of genuine care, because that allows you to then have more blunt and direct conversations that are helpful to both sides that don't become personal in a way that they shouldn't.
That it could be about the work, not about the human relationship.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Title: The best antidote to impostor syndrome
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Monica Stewart

Christine Laperriere:
And today we have Monica Stewart on the show and I'm excited to talk to her cause she reached out to us on LinkedIn with a particular angle on her experience of a best boss.
So Monica, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Monica Stewart:
Hey Christine, thank you so much for having me.
Great to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And then please introduce yourself just for everybody listening.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah, definitely.
So my name is Monica Stewart.
I'm the founder and CEO of Five Limes Consulting.
And what we do is we work with startup founders, CEOs and sales leaders to help them grow their business in a meaningful and sustainable way.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
That sounds like very interesting work.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah, it is.

Christine Laperriere:
So now I'm gonna just dive in.
Tell us who's your best boss ever and why.

Monica Stewart:
So when I saw your post on LinkedIn, the first person that came to mind right away was the first boss that I ever had besides my dad, who was the first person that ever hired me for a sales job and the first person that hired me out of college.
His name was Jared Rose.
At the time I didn't even wanna be in sales.
I graduated with a political science degree.
Everyone was telling me I should go to law school.
I didn't wanna do that.
I didn't really know what I wanted to do.
But what I did know is that I did not want to be an executive assistant, which is what every recruiter that I spoke with tried to get me to interview for.
They were like, what industry do you wanna work in?
Okay, great.
Let's try to get you an executive assistant role.
And I was like, what is this, the 70s?
That is a little offensive actually.
It actually was.
And I mean, just so that everyone is aware, this was like the mid 2000s.
So yeah, I mean, it's a little bit better now, but yeah, it's been slow going.
So, you know, even at the age of like 21, I was like, yeah, that's never gonna take me where I wanna go.
So I was like looking around and I found this conference company and I interviewed with Jared.
I was the first person that he hired to build this division that he was building inside the company.
And we just, we got along.
He had the same major in school.
We vibed and I convinced him to hire me.
And I think that what he did that was so effective.
And I think that it specifically worked for like someone with my personality is he gave me some very basic tools.
Like the things that he told me to do were the things, I mean, a lot of the things that like I still teach teams in sales today.
And then just for some context, it was a conference company that did institutional investment education events.
And my job was to cold call and email, like the biggest institutional investors in the world, like the people that run like the AP funds in Sweden or like the BP pension fund or something, and then get them to come to our events or ideally like kind of help us develop the events.
So it was pretty intimidating and I didn't really have a lot to go on.
It was basically like make a hundred cold calls between the hours of 7 a.m.
and like 1 p.m.
when European hours are over.
Jared sat about five feet away from me.
He made no calls.
So it was basically just like me.
Sitting on a phone, making cold calls.
Making cold calls.
No one else is in the office yet.
Like everyone can hear everything that I'm saying.
And I think that what he told me is he was like, okay, he's like, you know, you do this and then a week later you follow up again and then you do that like five more times.
Like it was just very like basic, not overly complicated, just sort of like this is how you run this process.
And then he gave me a framework for how to think about those conversations.
And then he gave me a lot of freedom.
So the framework was basically like, do whatever you can that you think will work.
And I think that I had, I didn't even know enough to be intimidated at that age.
So I just sort of jumped right in.
And so I ended up doing really well really quickly.
And within a couple of weeks, he was like, I think he was sort of like, okay, she's gonna work out.
You know, like I'm not gonna like, like she's gonna like keep this job.
I'm gonna invest in her more.
So he said, okay, you're gonna come to the next event that we're having, which was this conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
So I'm like, oh my gosh, okay, like get my passport renewed really quick.
Fly to Lisbon, we spend a day like setting up.
And then it's the night before the conference is starting.
And I'm like, okay, like what's the plan?
And so I asked him if he had a couple of minutes and I went to his hotel room with my little notebook and I was like, so what do you want me to like do here?
You know, like, do you want me to sit in the sessions and learn about all of the content?
Do you want me to help like run logistics and check people in, like what's the goal?
And he was like, oh, that's right.
You've never done this before, sorry.
I just invited you, you know, as a guest.
Yeah, he's like, oh yeah, I forgot you didn't know about, you didn't know how this works yet.
He gave me like still one of the best pieces of advice that I've ever gotten, which was, he was like, look, basically all I want you to do is just try and make connections with people because ultimately the reason that you're here is to take over like a lot of my relationships so that I can keep building this business.
And so, you know, everybody here, I know personally pretty much, but I want them to know you.
So just talk to people.
And then at the end of the event, you can tell me who you think you made a good connection with.
And then I'll tell you which of those you can take over as your clients.
And I was like, cool.
And he's like, there's just one thing that you need to remember, which is don't try to impress anyone because you can't, you know?
Like you just graduated from college.
These guys are, they're in their 50s.
They're highly educated.
They've been everywhere.
They manage trillions of euros.
Like it's just no, and he said it in a way that it was not disempowering at all.
It was actually extremely empowering because it took all of this pressure off and it wasn't in any way a put down.
It was just like, it was honest, you know?
And it was just like, look, like this is what it is.
Like don't try to impress anyone because you can't.
Just try to connect with people.
Just talk to them.
And that just resonated with me so strongly.
And I think it was also what I wanted to do anyway, but I'm like, you know, it's like, is it going to be enough?
And it was the best, it's probably like the best antidote to imposter syndrome that I can think of, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
It's exactly what I'm thinking the whole time.
How many of us feel terrified in a situation like that?
I mean, I would even like just the heads of multiple financial institutions or whatever.
I'd be very nervous, right?

Monica Stewart:
Totally.

Christine Laperriere:
What a great piece of advice.

Monica Stewart:
It really was.
And it was, you know, there's some situations I think in which you do really have to psych yourself up and be like, yes, like I own this and I am that person.
But I think there's so many situations in life where you're like, I'm not.
Like the only thing that I have to offer here is my attention.
And that's in and of itself extremely powerful.
So that's what I did.
And then I had a great time and the conference was great and I made a bunch of friends.
And then I just sort of continued doing that.
And then I think like once we sort of started to develop some trust, the other thing that was so transformational about that experience is that he gave me a lot of freedom, which I think was a function of just, I think I was maybe the first person that he had ever managed.
And he was just sort of like, well, she's doing her job.
Like she's doing well.
So I'll just let her keep doing that.
Like, great, that's why I hired her so that I can go do other things.
Like, and then he sort of would give me as much guidance as I needed, but he also gave me a ton of freedom.
So, and with that, I did like crazy things.
Like by the end of that job, I convinced the company to organize a conference in Iceland because I just really wanted to go to Iceland.
And I put together.

Christine Laperriere:
So I really wanted to go to Iceland.

Monica Stewart:
That's where we should do it.
So I made an event there.
Like I created the whole program.
I got all the speakers.
It was a really successful event.
It actually ended up being right before, like a month before the 2008 financial crash, which if you followed anything about, yeah, banking at that time, Iceland's economy as a country was extremely involved in.
So at the last minute, like the minister of finance, they found out about my event because I mean, obviously like Iceland is a tiny country and the minister of finance of Iceland like called us and asked if he could come and speak.
And then the president of the country hosted a reception for us at his house.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
Yeah.
How often do you hear that?

Monica Stewart:
Never, it was so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that is so cool.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah.
And it's, it was just like an extremely such the opposite experience of being someone's executive assistant.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Monica Stewart:
That's best career decision ever.
And I think it really, it allowed me to grow really fast in a really short period of time.
And I think for somebody coming right out of school, it changed the way that I saw myself as a professional in an irreversible way.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
Amazing.
That is a great story.
Anything else you wanna add to that?

Monica Stewart:
The thing is, Christine, is when I was kind of putting together my thoughts on this, it also made me think about how since that time, the way that most sales organizations are run has changed completely.
So even for a small company like that, right now there would be like probably three or four different roles and I would have to start in one of those roles.
And I do have a lot of concern for people that are entering sales or have in the last like five years that they're just not getting those opportunities anymore.
I saw a post on LinkedIn the other day where, or I believe it was maybe in Modern Sales Pros, where somebody was asking if they should allow an SDR to go to a big in-person client meeting that they had set up.
And this is like a major enterprise sale.
So this person probably spent like a couple of months working with like 10 different contacts to get everybody in the same room.
And they were doing great.
They were hitting all their numbers.
They were crushing their role.
And they were wondering if they should invite them to go and meet the client in person and go along with the sales team.
And it was like a real debate, like more than half of the people in the conversation were saying no.
And it's like, well, how do you expect people to see a career path if they do everything right and they're doing everything that you're asking them to do and actually probably exceeding expectations and you don't even give them the chance to like get in the room.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, no, that's sad actually.

Monica Stewart:
It's really sad.
Yeah.
And then maybe in two years that person is gonna be promoted to an account executive and then all of a sudden they're gonna be expected to flip a switch and just know how to do that innately.
Like I think that those sort of like quantum growth opportunities can be so transformational for people.
And I think that one of the things that's really been lost in what predictable revenue taught us and kind of the assembly line model that most sales orgs are running today is that people don't get those opportunities as much.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, they're not getting creative enough with how they manage the process.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah, exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
So do you have any other leaders that come to mind when you think of your best boss?

Monica Stewart:
I do.
So I always tend to think of things in threes.
I don't know why it just, my brain just works that way.
So that was the first person that I ever worked for.
And then the second person would be actually the last person that I ever worked for, which was Jake, who's the CEO of Scaled Consulting that I was at for a couple of years before I went off and recommitted to my own practice.
So after I started with Jared, then I embarked on this whole 15-year-long sales career.
I started working in B2B SaaS.
I started training the teams that I worked on.
Then I started being a sales leader.
And then I just went into consulting and I started helping other companies build their sales teams.
And I actually went into consulting before I worked with Scaled.
So I did it on my own and then I was with them and now I'm back with my own practice again.
And I think at that time, that job was really my dream job.
It was the culmination of everything that I had been working really hard for, for many, many years, just really doing the whole startup hustle thing, 10 to 16-hour days, pushing really, really hard, constantly redefining what my notions of success were.
And for me, working for Scaled was the culmination of all of that because in my mind, I didn't want to be tied to working for just one company.
I wanted to be able to help as many different teams and as many different founders as possible.
So to me, I saw that as the best way to do that.
And I was really excited about also learning from Jake because he has a ton of experience.
He's an incredible sales leader.
And the way that the whole thing started is they actually asked me to come and work for them as a consultant because they had a bunch of new projects that they thought that I would be really good on.
And I accepted that on the condition that I could have a desk in their office in SoHo because I live nearby and I really don't like to work from home.
And I really just wanted to be able to come into the office and just hear Jake talk on the phone every day because I thought that I would learn a lot from that.
And then after about a month and a half of this, they were like, why don't you just work here?
Why don't you just help us run this company?
And so at first I was like, oh my gosh, yes.
And then I was like, man, I just failed at not working for someone else again.
That was supposed to be the whole point, but I thought, okay, I'm gonna learn a lot from this experience.
And I think that what that experience was, it was like the pressure that forms a diamond.
It was probably the most intense job that I've ever had.
And now I would never say yes to that type of environment, which was also a big learning for me is that that's actually not something that I want to create in my life.
And it's not the way that I ever want to run my own business.
But I think at the time, it was probably the only thing that I would have paid attention to because I had just gone through this run of working at companies where I was so valuable to them that they didn't really challenge me on things that I probably needed to be challenged on because I was getting results.
And this is unfortunately something that happens to a lot of people and a lot of salespeople and sales leaders that are really good at their jobs.
And this is one of the reasons that the industry has such a bad reputation is so many people are allowed to form bad work habits and toxic patterns of relating with people because no one calls them out on it.
I think you said in one of your other podcasts, the broccoli in your teeth thing, there are very few people who will really have that conversation with you because they don't want to disrupt all of the progress that you're making and all of the things that you're doing for the company.
And for me, I had just come off of a run of the last three companies that I worked at all being successfully acquired, which I contributed a lot to like two of those wouldn't have happened if it weren't for me.
One of them I can't take as much credit for because that was Trello and they were already well on their way.
But it's like, if you're working at a startup and your boss is like almost the same age as you, like you just don't get that like structure.
I had developed a structure that worked for myself, but I needed to like level that up.
And that's what working at Scaled really did for me.
What were your bad habits, can I ask?
Sure, yeah.
So my bad habits were always being super last minute for things because I knew that I could just, I could make it work.
Like I could just show up and talk and be brilliant and like run the presentation and just like wing it.
My other bad habits were overthinking things that I was doing.
I am a huge perfectionist and have a lot of tendencies as a procrastinator, like a lot of people do.
It was hard for me to get in the habit of just like forcing myself to ship things in small iteration.
That was definitely something that I learned.
And then I would also say like faster communication cycles.
I would delay difficult conversations because I wanted to think about the right way to do it, or I would always just prioritize something else first.

Christine Laperriere:
Got it, yeah.
And so now you're working for Jake and you're in this environment and these bad habits, they're not gonna give you the same latitude, I guess.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah, 100%.
The vibe at the time was very like, and I think also because I was on the leadership team, it was like everything, like my whole life was work basically.
All of my personality, my personal habits, what I did outside of work, all of it was sort of accessible, which is one of the things that I wouldn't say yes to now.
Like I would never now do like work calls at 8 p.m.
or 10 p.m.
for example.
I was traveling like at least 25% of the time and I was like, oh, sure, that's fine.
I'll just like fly back from Boston at 10 p.m.
and then the next morning get on a train at 5 a.m.
to like go see this client here.
Like it was not work.
There was no work-life balance at all.
So that was the part that like ultimately kind of led me away from it.
But in kind of the journey of getting there, I had to face a lot of the bad habits that I had and also just learn how to work with people in a way that I had never had to do before because I was managing our consulting practice, which meant that I was interfacing with like maybe 30 to 40 consultants and then all of our clients all at the same time.
So it was like this amazing like black belt bootcamp crash course in like incredible diplomacy and negotiation skills and also like a lot of very, very, very directed, I would say tactical empathy.
So the skills that you learn when you're like learning how to be a really great salesperson, which is like figuring out what might go wrong in any given situation, understanding what it is that people need from you and how the best way is to deliver that to them and how to get people to like sort of align towards a common goal and then like push them towards the outcome that you want, which is something that you do in the sales process over and over.
That was pretty much what I did every day with like 30 people that were not full-time employees and were all run ahead their own businesses and their own lives and their own styles.
And then any number of startup founders who are also very chaotic.
And it was just like this constant like making all of those pieces fit together and work together.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, and it sounds intense.
So then how did Jake, tell me a little bit more about how did he influence the way that you, pressure that forms into a diamond, right?
So it sounds like it was an amazing experience for you all the same, even if it was chaotic and intense.
Like tell me a little bit more about how Jake influenced that.

Monica Stewart:
I would say that like those, like those broccoli in your teeth conversations, he probably has those conversations like 10 times a day with different people.
It's like probably one of his favorite things to do, which.

Christine Laperriere:
You're like, thanks.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah, exactly.
And it's, I mean, it's a real gift because it's not, you know, that is not an easy thing to do for people.
And it must take an incredible amount of energy to even pay that much attention to so many people all the time.
So that the information was really valuable.
But I think that like for me, just to like sort of drop my ego a little bit and be able to hear that was also really, really, really valuable because sometimes you don't want to.
Like if sometimes, like if that happens to you, like once you're like, wow, amazing.
Thank you so much.
And if it happens to you, like once every couple of months, you're like, oh, this is great.
I'm growing so much.
If it happens to you like every day, sometimes you're just like, I know, but like just give me a minute, you know?
So it was like that level of performance that I hadn't really encountered anywhere before.
And a lot of people really struggled with it.
Like a lot of people didn't actually do well under that environment.
And that's why I say, I think it was like really what I needed at the time, but not something that I would choose again.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
That's really interesting though.
It speaks to a value of almost like a pressure cooker type of environment and all of us love that short-term stretch, but the burnout that comes from that.

Monica Stewart:
Totally.
And that's exactly what happened is I got, I ended up getting really burned out.
And at the same time that I was kind of going through that journey and like I really committed myself there.
And for a while I was like, this is exactly what I wanted.
I mean, even to the point where when I was working at Hanjiva, it's now called S&P Global Market Intelligence.
I would ride a city bike up Lafayette street through SoHo to get to that office.
And I would ride by this particular building and there was a La Cologne coffee shop downstairs.
And I would be going past there at like, 8.15 or something.
And I would see all of these like really cool SoHo people getting coffee at La Cologne, just hanging out in the sunshine like about, and I'm like, man, that would be so nice.
They probably work like right here and they're just gonna stroll over to their office now.
Meanwhile, I was like, I'm gonna like hop onto a Zoom call and that's gonna be the rest of my day.
And there's just something about like that coffee shop and that building.
And that is the building that the scaled offices were in.
Interesting.
Then I was one of those people, I walked to work, I was there getting my cortado, wearing cool outfit, like the whole thing, like everything that I envisioned is like what that was.
I loved my clients.
I loved the job.
I loved the freedom.
I loved working for a small company.
I loved the traveling for a while.
And then kind of like, I think a pressure cooker is a good analogy because eventually the pressure sort of like pushed me out of that into a new phase in my life where during that time, I was also kind of going through like some personal reviews and kind of thinking about like what I wanted the direction of my life to be.
And I started to realize that there was some real friction between that and like what my job was.
And part of it, I think was actually like that level of like personal scrutiny and like performance expectation eventually started to conflict with like new ideas of myself that I was forming.
So I remember like there was one time that we were having dinner with the other partner and some of our consultants.
And we were talking about a big training rollout that we were gonna do for one of our biggest clients later that year that was sort of like an all hands on deck type of situation.
And I think like the other partner was going to, he was going to like the south of France on vacation with his wife for a couple of weeks that summer.
And I was like, well, you know, if we're gonna be doing one of the cohorts around August, don't count me in for that because I'm gonna be out for two weeks in August because I'm going to Burning Man.
And Jake was just like, when are you gonna grow up?
And I was like, excuse me?
And it like, in that moment, I was sort of like, whoa, wait, hold on.
Like this guy is gonna go drink rosé on the beach in the south of France for two weeks.
And I'm gonna go drink rosé at Burning Man.
Like what's the difference, you know?
And there were just some things like that where I sort of started to be like, okay, there's some boundaries to draw here between like, these are the things that I wanna take from this situation and then these are the things that I'm not willing to, that are not malleable for me.

Christine Laperriere:
This is the line.
There is a line that's getting crossed.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah.
And I think it was really helpful for me to like have the experience of being able to relax a lot of my boundaries and like let in a lot of direction and a lot of advice because I had never felt like I had that much to learn from someone that I worked for before.
And then once I had sort of started to complete that cycle, then I started to decide like where my new boundaries were going to be.
And then that was one of the things that kind of led me to being like, okay, I think that like I've completed this chapter.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, you're complete.
You got a lot from the experience and now it's time for you to be the next version of you.

Monica Stewart:
Right, exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that makes sense to me.
So then on that note, tell us a little bit about those who were not or maybe one that comes to mind that is not your best boss ever.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah.
So that was the next, it's almost like a video game, right?
Like, you know, like the end of a video game, you face like the final boss and then like you graduate.
So the hardest one is yourself and that was kind of the outcome of my experience at Scaled is it led me to saying yes to myself in some really important ways that kind of brought me back onto the path of realizing that I actually don't really want to work for anyone else and I really needed to commit to building a business on my own.
So that was something that I thought wouldn't be a huge transition for me because I had always been really self-directed and I've always kind of created my own job wherever I am, like I'll be hired.
They're like, okay, you're our third AE hire.
And I'm like, you know what this company needs an enterprise sales business.
Like, I'm just gonna go do that.
So I felt like I, you know, and my parents are entrepreneurs and the whole thing.
And then I started to start to carve out space to start to work on like my own projects.
And I ran into every single tendency that can hold you back in rapid succession.
Like starting with like procrastination, like I would sit down to do something and then I would be like, well, wait, what am I supposed to even be doing during this time?
And like, wait, where's my notes?
And da, da, da, da.
And then I'm like, my God, I would never show up for a meeting with somebody else like this.
Like, why am I doing this, you know, for myself?
And then that sort of led to, you know, the second part where it's sort of like, well, whatever, like you're not gonna be able to do a job at this right now.
So just go do something else anyway.
And then feeling really bad at myself because I wasn't being productive enough.
And then realizing that I was being the overbearing boss that I was trying to get away from to myself.
And that I still had that voice in my head that was like, you know, what are you doing?
You're never going to be successful.
Like, this is ridiculous.
And then I'm like, wait a minute, like, who am I performing for?
And so that was the most interesting part of it was realizing that I still had in my head, like the voice of everybody that I've ever worked for.
And it was like this weird invisible Greek chorus around me in my office by myself.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, I understand all of that.
Really?
I felt that when I went on my own and started my own business in 2008, I had the same, quite a few years of imposter syndrome meets like every negative person that you've ever encountered is like whispering in your ear all day.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Monica Stewart:
And I think it's like, we don't have a lot of models for positive motivation and like positive self-management.
There's a lot of really bad models for that.
And I think that in the absence of another framework, your brain just sort of defaults to whatever has worked for you in the past, even if what that was, was actually not really that healthy.
Like there's a lot of things that can be effective that are actually not really good in the long-term.

Christine Laperriere:
Calling yourselves names and yeah, beating up on yourself and going on about what a total useless loser you are.
And setting like- Which has got no bearing.
It's not the helpful way to get a business off the ground, but- 

Monica Stewart:
It's not the helpful way to get a business off the ground.
I would never manage anyone else like that.
Like the way that I work with other people is so different from the way that I work with myself.
It's crazy.
Also setting completely unrealistic expectations.
It took me three years to realize that I wasn't scheduling lunch breaks for myself and my calendar.
I'll just block off my whole day, not necessarily with meetings, but with times that I'm supposed to be doing things.
And then I was like, wait, why am I constantly running late for the schedule that I set for myself?
And I'm like, oh, cause I might need to, I don't know, go walk outside and get a coffee or maybe make a sandwich or something like that.
And like, that's okay.
Or if I wanted to, I could even just go for a walk for 40 minutes for no reason, because that's why I work for myself.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
You are speaking to the choir right now.
I was as a, yes.
I mean, I go through this, by the way, it doesn't really ever go entirely away.

Monica Stewart:
Right, right.

Christine Laperriere:
Just has different migrating forms, right?
But to your exact point, I have a very hard, if it's between the hours of nine and five, I literally have the hardest time stepping away from my own desk.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah, totally.

Christine Laperriere:
It's just my brain is like, this is gonna be failure.
Like, here you go.

Monica Stewart:
Like, this is how it happens.
Yeah, totally.

Christine Laperriere:
It's like one day, you go take the dog for the walk, the next day you're laying on the couch, eating chips, watching reruns and you just completely fail.

Monica Stewart:
Right, and then your life is over.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, and I have no idea why.
I mean, it's good to have a work ethic, but there is definitely, I, to your point, at the start of COVID had to, after burning myself out, had to give myself the sit down and the tough talk about scheduling lunch.
So if you see my calendar right now, there's like a lunch block on every day.
And it's just very funny because I had to come back to like, why can I not take an hour, go take 20 minutes to chop up a salad and eat healthy and like, I'm not, you know what I mean?
I'm not on the road.
I don't need to have fast food.
Like what is the, why the rush?
What is the rush?
Especially when it's the schedule that you created that you have a hard time keeping up with.
You're like, then maybe I need to do something different.

Monica Stewart:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
I totally get all of it.

Monica Stewart:
Because I am creating all of this.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, I totally get it.

Monica Stewart:
I do think that there's this thing, which is like the other journey where, you know, you have, I don't know if you do, I have a lot of anxiety that if I'm not doing something, then like nothing is going to be happening in my business, which was then also an invitation to be like, oh, well like I should change that, you know, because that's not really a long-term strategy.
So all of these learnings have been really eyeopening.
And then the other, I think the other part about it is it's also given me like so much more empathy and like even like strengthened my resolve for why I do what I do.
Because the reason that I do what I do is I really, I just have such a soft spot for people that start their own businesses, because I've worked in them, you know?
And I know how hard it is.
And like I've seen, you know, I've been with companies that have gone from like, you know, they're like 10 or 20 employees to like almost a hundred and like huge success.
And seeing what that meant for everybody there, especially the people that were there from the beginning on a professional financial level, but also just on a personal level, is like still some of my happiest like moments in life.
Like that is just so freaking rewarding for me.
And I think that now it also like has given me an even deeper level of empathy, because I've known for a long time that like, if you have a company and like less than a hundred people up until that size, like the way that your company works and the personality of your organization is literally you, just like spread onto that organization.
And I see like that reflected in myself as well.
And I think like having a greater personal experience of it has also helped to make me better at what I do, because it's easier for me to see it in other people too.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, you've gotten more perspective because you're now in multiple seats of it.

Monica Stewart:
Exactly, because it's like all these learnings, you know, like that you need to schedule time for all the things you need to do in a day, including like eating and that, you know, you need to make the things that you do scalable and all of that.
This is like advice that of course, like I would give to anybody else, but it's also amazing how no matter how much you know and how much experience you have, somehow you always still have to go through all of the steps yourself anyway.

Christine Laperriere:
Trust me, I have, I am speaking to the converted.
I get that completely.
So that is amazing.
So just kind of as we're starting to wrap, I'm curious, you know that there's leaders that are listening to this.
They're on the hunt for becoming, or maybe they already are best bosses and they're always looking for fresh ways.
What would be some of the tips that you would give them?

Monica Stewart:
Oh man, there's two books that I would recommend that have helped me immensely.
One is the Upper Limit Problem by Gay Hendrix.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I like that one.

Monica Stewart:
It's really good.
He has some podcasts too, if you don't want to read the whole book.
There's another one.
It's a book that a friend of mine gave me that I've probably given out like six copies to people so far, which is called The Diamond Cutter.
I can't remember the name of the author, but it's the best explanation of like super practical application of Buddhist principles that I've ever come across.
And it's cool because the name refers to the Diamond Cutter Sutra in Buddhism, but it's also about a literal diamond importing company that these Buddhist monks run.
It's just a very, very, very cool book.
It's not like fluffy at all.
It has like extremely practical, like practices that you should do.

Christine Laperriere:
I will be Amazoning that as soon as we're off the call.

Monica Stewart:
It's super good.
And The Upper Limit Problem is a fantastic book.
So you've got one great referral that I know of and now I'm looking forward to reading the other one.
Good, I think you'll really like it.
And then the other thing that I would say is like, always be willing and maybe like just make some time to do this once a month or once a quarter if once a month is not feasible, like to sit down and come back to your core principles of like, what are your goals that you want to achieve in your business?
But then also, why did you start your business and how is that being reflected in your life?
And then be willing to just completely throw everything out.
I am a big fan of calendar blocking and scheduling all the time for the things that you need to do, but I'll go back and redo my calendar like once a month because I'll realize like, I don't really need this time or there's this other thing that I'm doing that I haven't been making time for.
I actually don't want to go on LinkedIn in the morning because I don't want to look at anything on the internet in the morning until I've done my deep thinking or whatever it is.
So I would say that it's sort of like a strong opinion, loosely held approach to managing your life.
Like try something, go for it, see how it works and then be willing to just completely try something else.
Another thing that's influenced me a lot is the one thing by Gary Keller.
And I think that this is so, so, so powerful for people that are in leadership or that are on the journey of leading themselves, which is like, it's okay to not do all of the things all of the time.
In fact, you can't.
Like it's totally fine for a while to just be like, I'm gonna be really selfish with my business right now and I'm just gonna do that and I'm not available for people.
And like maybe I will see, I'll have like two social things like a month and like that's it.
And I'm happy with that.
I'm gonna be a hermit for a while because I really wanna go far in this part of my business.
And then sometimes it's okay to just sort of like coast and be like, you know what?
I really need to take care of myself right now and I'm gonna do all the things that need to do and I'm gonna show up to the meetings and do the thing, but I'm not really trying to like push forward a lot on my business right now because I need to take care of myself more.
It's okay to not be like making progress on all fronts all the time.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
I love that.
I just think that's interesting because I wrote a book called Too Busy to Be Happy and it's really this concept of work-life wisdom and I keep saying work-life wisdom to me is so much different than work-life balance.

Monica Stewart:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Work-life wisdom is like knowing what you need.
It's like that boundary, but it is a migration and it's changing and it's not fixed.
So your work-life wisdom might look very different than mine.
And that's- That's so true.
You know, taking out this thought of balance, which almost insinuates 50-50 right off the bat and to your idea, it's like, it doesn't, I think that the problem is so much of us feel like we're failing in this work-life balance thing, but if you come back to this idea of work-life wisdom, which is I'm very much like you where it's like I kind of power hard in the fall, I power hard in the spring, but I do like a big break at the Christmas and a big break in August, like, and I recoup, like I just, but it's very intentional because I just have learned that that's my work-life wisdom.
Like I need, I can turbo power for about eight months out of the year.
And then I very instinctively do it knowing that there is a day when I'm probably gonna do very little work.
Like, you know, August is a month that I take it very light, you know, and lots of times for hiking, lots of time for doing the stuff that I like to do, you know, kids, you know, I've got kids, it's ice cream cones and melty faces and all that, but I want that.
Like, I don't wanna think that I missed that, you know?
And so those are super important times for me to do the things that are, you know, so it's just interesting when you say that to me, it's screaming, you're finding that work-life wisdom that works for you, where sometimes you're tipped in and sometimes you're tipped back a little bit.

Monica Stewart:
It's kind of like making deposits in like different areas of your life that you can like then cash in later.
Like you're making like, you know, career deposits.
And then in August, you're like, cool, I already did all that work and now that's just carrying me.
And then you get to make like emotional deposit for yourself and for your relationship with your family.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's great.
Listen, Monica, this was amazing.
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today.
And like I said, thank you, thank you.

Monica Stewart:
Thank you, Christina.
It was really fun.

Episode: 57
Title: Wisdom from Joe
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Brent Currie

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have Brent Curry on the show.
I'm very excited to share his story with you.
He was helping me facilitate a program that we lead with Scotiabank, and he started telling a story about a best boss that he had.
And I was so excited.
I had to reach out and ask him if he would consider sharing it on this show.
So, Brent, nice to see you.
Thanks, Christine.
Great to be here.
And I am so thrilled to dive into some of the great nuggets that you shared before.
I'll start with the big opening question.
Who is your best boss?

Brent Currie:
My best boss ever is Joe Brandt.
I worked for Joe about 15 years ago for about three years in the Toronto area.

Christine Laperriere:
Why did he come to mind when we asked you this question?

Brent Currie:
I reflected on that a little bit.
I think with Joe, the biggest thing for me is I genuinely felt that he wanted me to be the best version of myself I could grow to be, and that any of his coaching or feedback or suggestions were 100% altruistic, if that makes sense.
I truly felt that his desire was to, and it wasn't just me, you could probably find dozens of people literally across the bank that would say Joe was their best boss ever, because he truly invested in individuals, which ultimately helped him build high-performing teams, but the investment was in me, not in being the boss, if that makes sense.

Christine Laperriere:
Did you say he had some really great words of wisdom or he had the rules?
I really want to hear.
Tell me a little bit about this playbook that he started.

Brent Currie:
Yeah, so I created my own version of it.
I actually have a page on my computer called Wisdom from Joe that over the course of my time working with him, he would say things, some are direct quotes, some are concepts, and I would write them down, because I knew here I am now, like I say, 15 years later, and I reference that page from time to time just to see what I've maybe forgotten and haven't kind of leveraged, but they're helpful reminders to me that kind of live on, on and on.
I mean, a couple of examples, Joe had a document called The Ten Rules of Managing People, and they're just intrinsic truths.
They were facts that he had learned and experienced over his decades of leadership that he shared with all of us, and as we read through those rules, we would see examples that we had experienced, and sometimes we would see stuff that we hadn't seen come to light, but I can tell you, in the last 15 years, I don't think there's a rule in there that I haven't seen.
I'm not going to go through all 10, but I mean, like a couple of them are, never be surprised.
You think you've figured things out, which way the road turns and where the business is going, and things happen, and the way I've always interpreted never be surprised is never get flustered when things don't go according to plan.
Joe was one of the consummate examples of something would go wrong or not as planned, and his first reaction was, okay, let's understand what happened.
What are the facts?
How do we deal with it?
How do we move forward?
And so just the recognition that things will go off script, expecting the unexpected is half the battle, I think.
The other one was, Joe used to talk a lot about realize how important it is to build trusting relationships with your team, but also realize that because you're the boss, some people will never tell you 100% of the story.
And whether that's their own insecurities or fault for not building enough trust or whatever it is, realize that not everybody will bear their soul and tell everything about what they're thinking or feeling or worried about.
And he would always impress upon us the point that that's your job now as a leader to try and suss out the unspoken.
When someone says they're fine and you think they're not, why?
When someone gives you a reason for why something happened and you think that there's another part of the story in there, how do you get at that in a safe way, in a constructive way?
But just the realization that just because you ask somebody something and they answer it, oftentimes that boss relationship will filter that answer and just to kind of look for that gap and build the confidence to hopefully close and eliminate that gap most of the time.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, and again, that's an important leadership quality that a lot of us don't really talk about.
That one puts the onus on the leader to help uncover what was the missing information instead of pointing the blame at the team member who didn't feel comfortable sharing.

Brent Currie:
No, for sure.
I always felt with Joe that he never missed a teachable moment, but it always landed well, right?
We've all got things get labeled as constructive criticism, but sometimes constructive criticism kind of does feel like flat out criticism and you don't see the constructive value in it ever if not right in the moment.
But Joe had a knack for that not happening, right?
Something would come along and it would almost feel like it was script out of a movie, like something would happen.
You would say something and he would come in with some quote or some idea or some concept to make you think about it in a totally different way.
And it's like, how do these situations keep happening where he's just got the answer?
And in hindsight, it's the experience and the fact that he'd been around the horn a few times with different people in different scenarios.
But my point is whenever the feedback was delivered, it always felt like the gift that it was intended to be.
That's one of the things I picked up from him as well is when I do share feedback or constructive criticism, whatever label we decide to put on it, you say to someone, like if I didn't care about you as an individual, if I didn't care that you reach your full potential, I wouldn't give you the feedback.
Because oftentimes the feedback isn't make or break news or suggestions.
It's the stuff around the edges that helps people be better employees, better leaders, better people.
And a lot of it is kind of take it or leave it.
You don't really need to give all that feedback to help someone be a good employee.
But it's the stuff around the edges that is sometimes harder to share about the way someone's coming across or the way you're perceived or these sort of soft things that are uncomfortable conversations.
You need to be to have them.
But when it comes in a spirit of truly wanting someone to be their best, then it is more likely to be received as a gift.
And that's the way I always felt with Joe.
He never made me feel bad about the feedback that he shared or the suggestions that he would make.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent.
I have a tendency to nickname that the broccoli between your teeth feedback.
It's like, please don't let me walk around like this.
Sure, I can do it.
Nothing terrible is going to happen, but please don't let me work this hard and walk around with broccoli between my teeth.

Brent Currie:
And then if I don't tell you that you had broccoli between your teeth and then the next person does, you're going to look at me and go, why wouldn't you have told me that?
I mean, why didn't you give me that feedback?
And that can actually break down that trust or that feeling that have you really got my back?
Because if you did, you would have given that little awkward piece of feedback.
And yet you let it go.
I smiled for another 20 minutes until someone else took pity on me.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly it.
Right.
And that's, I do, I think that's the characteristic of a great boss.
I hear that over and over again is that, you know, they're willing to go there because it's in benefit of you, the person they're serving.
It's not about them.
Right.
Do you have any stories that you can think of that were particularly interesting from when you worked with him?

Brent Currie:
So the format that we were in, he led Toronto region.
So all the, all the branches in the region, kind of the GTA.
And there were eight of us that reported to Joe.
So eight district leaders that each had a collection of branches.
And once a year, you talk about the goals for next year.
Right.
And, you know, how do we want to, you know, acquire new customers, you know, different sales targets, things like that for the year and other regions I'd heard would have a very top-down approach to that.
Right.
So region would just say here, here for the eight of you, here are your goals.
And then figured out for the rest, Joe didn't do that on our behalf.
He instead would take the eight of us and literally locked us in a room and said, supplied with lots of guidance, lots of analysis, lots of data and said, you guys come out when you believe that the regional plan is fairly allocated across the eight of you.
And his guidance was you've all got a responsibility to take a big enough piece of the plan so that the region is successful.
And you've all got a responsibility to not kind of sit in the weeds and hope you get a smaller slice than you really think that you could deliver.
Cause that's not fair to the rest of your colleagues.
And his point was if at the end of this day or two days or however long it took us, if one or two of you comes out going, I got away with it here, like I got a little piece of the plan, then you've all failed.
And if one or two of you comes out of here and goes, Oh my goodness, like, how am I going to tell my branches the plans this big?
Like they're going to say, we don't have a chance of being successful.
He goes, if one or two of you think that then you've all failed.
He said, if all eight of you come out of here going, Oh man, that's, you know, that's a, that's a bit of a push and that's a stretch.
But you know what?
I think if we all work together, we can all get there and help more customers be successful and help the bank be successful at the same time, then you've probably done a good job as a team.
And I think that was a lesson he left with me is he never created a sense of competition within the team.
It was always, you know, customer first team, second, and kind of all for one, one for all, which, which I think created that broader trust across his team, which was, which was really good.
One of the funniest stories I've got from Joe was, was the first time that I thought I'd figure things out.
And I had an answer to his question that he didn't think I knew.
And so what happened was every week you would get your report about how, how your team did, right against plan.
And one week I had a week where my team did 85% of the weekly plan and we're having our touch base.
And he asked me, so talk to me about last week's results.
Like you were only 85% of plan.
What happened?
I said, well, Joe, it was a weekend.
It was a short week.
There was only four days in the week.
So actually it was only an 80% week and we did 85.
So funny enough, I think we actually overperformed.
And he said, Oh, right, right.
Okay.
Short week.
Yeah.
So how come you guys only delivered 85%?
And he asked me the same question, exactly the same.
And I thought he didn't hear my answer.
I was on the road.
I was driving home.
I thought maybe he didn't hear me and myself services bad.
So gave the same answer.
And Joe said, Oh, short week.
Right.
Okay.
So how come you only did 85%?
And then I realized then when he asked me the same question, exactly the same third time in a row, I was missing something.
And his question was, well, how come in GTA North, they did 120% and how come in, how come in GTA East, they did 115, right.
And his whole point was it's a relative world that we live in.
And you know, you, you need to look from a performance standpoint.
It's not just how you did against the clock or against the calendar.
How you did relative to the rest of, you know, the comparison set and the relative performance message.
I'd never thought of that before.
I'd never had never been thrown at me by anybody else.
And it's basically shaped everything going forward for me.
Like it's, it's a relative world.
And it was just an interesting take on it that seems so simple, but at the time didn't really see it.

Christine Laperriere:
I would have never thought of that as an answer either.
When I'm listening to the story, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have gone there either.
That's, and it's so, you know, it's so insightful, right.
That, you know, and how did it make you think differently when there was another short week coming and you had to coach your team?

Brent Currie:
Yeah.
I mean, it's in the applications run even far beyond that job, right.
Where a different job entirely.
And someone would say why something didn't happen or why it was more difficult for their team.
And it always led to the question of, okay, well that that's a good reason, but why is that different than anybody else?
Right.
Why is that like, is sometimes we give, we give what we think are excuses for things, but there are actually reasons that don't hold up against the relative comparison set.
Right.
And it was not to create a gotcha moment.
It was to create an awareness of don't explain away a problem and feel good that there's no problem when there actually is a problem and you're looking at it wrong.
Right.
So if there is and you excuse it away in an invalid way, you're going to stop looking for ways to improve and stop looking for ways to get better.
You'll just say, Oh, it's just because of the way it is.
Right.
And this relative, why is it different than any other region?
Why is it different than any other product or any other company causes you to go, I don't have the answer yet.
And I got to keep thinking about it or keep working with the team for them to think about a way to improve or a way to evolve.
Amazing.

Christine Laperriere:
So I do have a question for specific to when you work for Joe.
So many people have a hard time materializing the investment in leaders because they can't always see that direct investment.
But I'm curious, when you think of a leader like Joe Brandt, who was really, you looked up to, and you saw, you kept having these small aha moments every time he had these teachable moments.
What do you think was the hard hitting benefit to the business from a number standpoint?
I mean, could you guesstimate?

Brent Currie:
Everything he talked about started with, why does that matter to the customer?
How does that make a customer better off?
How does that make a customer feel better about their future and therefore want to do more business with us?
So because everything was always grounded in a customer needs standpoint, then what flows from that are more trusted relationships, more business, more loyalty, more referrals.
But it started out with a pure objective of one customer at a time.
How have we made their life better?
And all the other stuff just flows from that.
And that doesn't matter if you're in banking or if you sell toothpaste or if you sell cars.
It's not tricks of the trade to sell more.
It's about what unmet need do customers have that you have a solution for and how are you making that solution easy for them to get, understand, use, ask questions about, ask for help when they have it, because people's lives are busy and information overload makes lives confusing.
And if everything you focus on is meeting needs in an easy, frictionless way for customers, the business benefits will just flow naturally out of that.

Christine Laperriere:
So you know it impacts the bottom line through aligning people so thoughtfully toward the end game, which is happy customers.
But again, it's interesting how it's always tricky to measure, but you can feel it.

Brent Currie:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
That's why I always play this game of metrics are kind of a fascinating thing because when people feel alignment, they know it's better for the business, but they can't always tell you exactly what beans changed in the bean counter.

Brent Currie:
Right.
And I think the opposite is true as well.
Like you'll know when it's not there.
Like, you know what bad leadership does.
You know that bad leadership or selfish leadership or inconsistent leadership from an employee engagement standpoint, from people wanting to be at work and go the extra mile and spend that extra hour, you just won't get that.
Like you'll get a lot of just enough.
Thank you very much.
And again, you can't quantify the negative impact of that, but you'll certainly feel it in the long run.
Right.
You know, and I also think of it just as a legacy standpoint, like, you know, I learned a lot from Joe in the time I worked for him, but like the applications extend far beyond that one job.
Like they weren't, they weren't lessons that only ring true in this job or in this environment.
They don't only ring true in banking.
Like a lot of the stuff that I learned rings true in life, let alone, you know, leadership and a professional environment.
So I think that also just goes back to the, the authenticity of the leadership that, you know, helping people be better employees or better leaders themselves usually has a knock on effect in people's lives as well.
They go home at night, feeling better about their job, which allows them to be in a better mood when they're home with their family.
It allows them to bring wisdom to their, whatever their relationships are in their personal life.
Like you can't just shut off work Brent from home Brent from friend Brent from son Brent.
Like those are all people are fluid and work in a bunch of different environments.
And so I, I do think you've got an obligation as a leader to realize that the environment you create for people at work can have positive or negative knock on effects far beyond the office hours.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
That is probably one of the biggest things that I see is this leaders, the best bosses I really do believe can kind of change the world for a lot of people.
So it's why I'm so passionate about this topic because you do, you influence so many people when that person that works on your team goes home and they've had a terrible day and they don't have enough energy to talk to their kids and they kick the dog or whatever, you know, it's like all those people that have to live with them are by it.
So a great boss can be a game changer.
Amazing.
And so any other great leaders that come to mind, obviously I hear Joe is special, but do you have other ones that come to mind when I think of best bosses?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, like I've been very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with a number of great leaders over my career.
And so, you know, in the spirit of just picking one more, I worked for a fellow named Daniel and it was during COVID another leader at the bank.
Daniel's magic, I think was his ability to always, always was calm, never saw him get flustered ever.
And whenever something went off the rails, the first inclination, unlike many leaders, which is like how this happened, who was involved in it.
And the questions can feel very much like blame gaming.
He was always instantly, what happened?
Do we know for sure that's the extent of it?
What happened from a understanding standpoint?
Have we prevented it from happening again?
Like have we stopped the bleeding and what's the learning going forward?
And it was this learning orientation that was part of his personality and part of the way he presented to people throughout the whole company, which was people weren't therefore afraid to tell people when something went wrong because you knew that it was going to be received in the spirit of like, there's the immediacy of stop it, make sure it doesn't happen anymore.
But the learning and improving going forward was always the focus.
It wasn't a finger pointing blame game type situation.
It was always forward looking.
How do we use this to get better going forward?
And oftentimes the learning that resulted in mistakes was almost worth the mistake, right?
But because he genuinely treated surprises in that forward looking way, it made people comfortable to share.
And I believe the trust quotient just skyrocketed because of that.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's a really good point when you talk about the trust quotient, because to me, it's interesting how everybody thinks that they're very trustworthy and that you can be trusted.
But trust shows up on the bad day of like how safe do you feel in that environment?
The good days, we all trust each other.
But going to your boss in the middle of COVID and telling them that something came off the rails or a mistake was made or something got overlooked, that's the day that you don't feel nearly as safe as you did the day before.

Brent Currie:
Yeah.
Now we see if this was like actually who you are or if it's just lip service when the sun's shining, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Which I see a lot of the lip service version.
So I think that's a great example of how somebody really lived into his values so that you could trust him fully.
And during COVID, I mean, was there anything that he did to help the team kind of work through such a challenging time personally?
Because so for many of us, it was a very challenging time personally.

Brent Currie:
Yeah, there were a lot of, and this was new for me, like more of the, like I've always been someone that doesn't separate personal life from work life.
Like I am interested in what you did on the weekend and what your kids are doing or what, you know, your mom's party or like I do that stuff normally.
But what I learned from Daniel was the need to be even more regular and deliberate and maybe a bit deeper on those conversations, like the check-ins about how are you really doing?
And for me, that was, it was honestly awkward for a while because I wasn't wired to get that personal with people I work with and would tend to be a little more of the, no, I'm fine.
It's all good.
Yeah, it's okay.
You know, and it took a few of those conversations with him and his leadership team for us to feel vulnerable enough, I guess, to actually say how you were feeling.
And I think that that exercise with us as the leadership team helped us to then bring that authenticity to our teams as well about the importance of check-ins and that that wasn't unique to our business or unique to the bank.
I mean, I think people worldwide learned the importance of connecting with colleagues and teammates at a more personal and real level during COVID.
And I've seen that extend beyond the pandemic, which is one of the good things we're left with with the pandemic is this less transactional relationships and more real relationships and understanding that you're leading human beings, like you're not leading job titles.
And if that's done authentically, I think it can be very powerful.
So that was a big takeaway from my time with Daniel.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's a great example.
And I all be able to do that more frequently, but it probably never felt like a necessity the way that it did during that time.

Brent Currie:
It became popular and I think it's become lasting, which is good.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is great.
Yep.
Perfect.
And then I'm just curious.
I mean, we kind of danced into this when you've not had a best boss ever.
What are some of the attributes that kind of have stood out to you?

Brent Currie:
Like, I mean, I wouldn't say this person wasn't a best boss or was a bad boss.
I think everybody, present company included, has stuff about us that people who work with us probably wish we didn't do.
Right.
And whether they're habits or mannerisms or things like that, like there's a few that I've picked up along the way.
And I think if you try to get past them being that's irritating or that doesn't let me be my best and see the learning of it and go, maybe I want to make sure I never do that for anybody that I lead.
Right.
And so what are some of the habits that I've seen from leaders that I go, Hey, it doesn't mean you're a bad boss.
It's just like this little bit of the way you show up and I don't like, and I don't think a lot of people would like, and so I'm not going to do it.
Right.
And so nothing major other than, I mean, one would be the after hours email thing.
Like I had a couple of people I worked for that I could tell their work time was Sunday mornings and mine's not like mine's not.
And to get emails from your boss at 10 in the morning on a Sunday when even though he or she is not expecting an answer, but it's still ping, ping, ping on the Blackberry on the iPhone.
When I'm trying to separate myself and have a nice Sunday morning with my family, I found it very distracting.
And so COVID became a weird thing for that because people's work days kind of got all flexible.
Right.
I'm working from home.
So I've, you know, I might have to do stuff with my kids and then I'll be online later.
And we've lost this sense of a clock.
And so I also work at weird hours generally, like super early or late at night or on a Saturday.
Cause I cut out early on a Thursday and all these things.
But, but I'd ask my team now, like I tend to go like, do you, would you rather me when something comes to mind on a Saturday afternoon, do you want me to plop it into your inbox on Saturday or do you want me to save it up and like carpet bombing Monday morning with 16 emails?
And some people say, send it to me when you think of it, because I know that you don't need the answer right away, but it allows me to kind of reflect on it for a bit and think about it.
And it doesn't hijack my day when Monday, I think I've got my day plan.
All of a sudden, you know, I've got three questions at seven in the morning.
And others would say, I'd rather you keep the distance and draft them and hit send first thing Monday.
And so everybody's different.
And so I just learned from that one that like, you know, there are people who would have got those Sunday morning emails from that boss and but it's, I think it's asking and trying to say, you know, how do, how do I customize?
How do I do that is important.
And I think the most important one for me is consistency of mood of, of reaction.
Like I, like we all have days that are best, whether they're, you know, work stress, personal stress, I'm just tired.
I don't feel well, like whatever it is, but I never want to be the person that someone comes to me with something and my reaction was more influenced by other parts of my environment and it causes them to be afraid to come to me next time or to wonder because I've, I've seen that, like there are some people going like, is it a good day to ask them about this today?
Like what's, what's the vibe today?
Is now a good day to table this with the boss?
And it's like, don't, that's not good.
Like I, I would hope that people never have to double clutch before they come to me wondering what Brent they're going to get.
And so consistency and not, not fake, right?
Like I, like I don't think we can all say I'm great.
I'm awesome.
I'm perfectly fine.
Cause then people see like it's just, you've just slapped on veneer and now I don't trust you because nobody is perfect all the time, but it's, it's being human, but at the same time, being able to pause and realize that other stressors in your life don't mean that the way you react to things from your need to come out differently.
So consistency, respect, measured reactions, you know, don't get too excited.
Don't get too down, kind of keep it in the middle of the lane.
I think consistency takes away an unnecessary stress that inconsistent leadership would give to people.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that point.
And I don't think anybody's ever brought that up before.
So I'm having an aha moment while you're sharing that because I think it's such a, it's exactly what you said.
It's like when you, when you have consistent leadership, you don't really notice it.
It's kind of like water.
You're just, you know, you appreciate it because you're swimming in it.
But I've experienced the inconsistent leadership in my own professional world.
And you're right.
That really does make each day almost like an added wild card.
Cause you have six things you're trying to get done.
And who knows how my boss is going to react today.

Brent Currie:
And now you're developing contingency plans in your head.
If she loves it, I'll say this.
And if he hates it, I'll say that.
And if he's kind of mad, then I'll do this, like all that energy that you just wasted on figuring out my next comment based on four potential reactions.
Like that energy could have been probably put into making the solution even better or working on problem number two.
And I just think time is, is it such a premium for everybody that anything we can do to, to not cause people to waste time dealing with our own inconsistencies is probably time well spent.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's excellent.
That makes so much sense to me.
And it does speak to the trust issue again, because it goes back to when you don't know what to expect and there could be a negative consequence when you walk into an office, you don't feel safe.
So, you know, it's the same thing.
Like you don't know, okay, well, if they were in bad traffic this morning, I don't know if I'm going to be the one that gets the brunt of that in the staff meeting, you know?
So it's such a good point.
Those are useful.
So, you know, I always think we do, we learn a lot from the leaders that we, we didn't, you know, the certain attributes, like you said, we didn't love that.
And let's try not to do that ourselves.
But I think those were some really good ones that again, you probably wouldn't even notice in a great leader, but you really notice when you work with somebody who doesn't bring that.

Brent Currie:
Right.
Yeah.
You notice when it's not there.

Christine Laperriere:
Perfect.
Just to kind of wrap these up, if you had to teach or advise future leaders on how to be a best boss, what would be some of the things you'd ask them to focus on?

Brent Currie:
Yeah, I think the first one is you being a leader, realize it's not about you, it's about the people you're leading.
Much like when I said, Joe always focused on the customer and the banker meeting with them.
And from that good results will follow.
I think, you know, if you approach leadership from almost like a servant leader standpoint and an enabler to help people recognize and attain their full potential, then good things will happen.
Like I want you to be successful for yourself.
I want you to recognize and achieve your full potential for yourself.
And you know what?
Knock on effect is if everyone on the team does that, then as a team, we're going to perform better.
And then that will reflect well on me as a leader, right?
As opposed to, you know, I want to make sure I mold and shape everybody well so that I look good as the leader.
I think it has to be genuine.
It has to be selfless.
I think the results will follow.
That's one.
I think that the check-ins are important.
Like that is one where COVID has helped me.
Like I say, I've never been someone to shy away from getting to know my team, but it's that little bit extra about really caring about, no, really, how are you doing, right?
I think people that are genuine about that also have a better connection.
And the last thing I think is assume good intent, right?
Like people make mistakes.
People say things that maybe they wish they didn't say or use a tone they wish they didn't use or an email is often the worst because, you know, tone gets inferred from the written word.
It's not heard and felt.
And so I think as a leader, teaching yourself and teaching others to always assume good intent versus reacting and assuming things is good.
So, you know, when mistakes are made or when a step is missed or when a word happens that someone kind of cringes at, if you start from a place of going, maybe they didn't mean for that to be the outcome.
And they were really trying hard.
And that's just the way it happened.
Let's understand why it's kind of ties into the Daniel thing, right?
Of like, okay, so that happened.
Let's let's try to understand why and what's the learning from it.
And I think assuming good intent is a good jumping off point for that.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that because, you know, we try to encourage people not to make assumptions, but the truth is we're human.
So making assumptions is built into our brain's ability to figure things out quickly.
So instead of saying, don't make assumptions, saying, let's just assume positive intent.

Brent Currie:
Right, right.

Christine Laperriere:
Let's start with the best in mind that, you know, the person really was trying to do the best job they could in the moment.
And the best job might have been sending a scathing email at midnight, you know, and then to your point, then coaching from that.
Okay, if that was the best job you could do, how can we help you find a teachable moment out of that and a new strategy next time?

Brent Currie:
For sure.
I mean, it's if you assume good intent and then, your discovery unveils that it actually wasn't good intent, you'll get there fast enough.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Brent Currie:
But most of the time, it probably was good intent.
So, you know, you're going to be right more than you're not if you start out with that assumption work from there.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's great.
Brent, this is amazing.
Thank you so much.
Again, I love picking out those words of wisdom from leaders who have worked for great leaders and getting a chance to find out kind of how you've informed your point of view.
So this is really helpful.

Brent Currie:
It was fun to do this.
Can I share one other thought just to end?

Christine Laperriere:
Please.

Brent Currie:
So one of the things that I've thought about and as I, you know, as I get on in my career is how are you going to be remembered?
And the whole legacy thing, right?
And it's, and I just know the way I talk about Joe, the way countless other colleagues who are on the team with me at the same time still talk about Joe, reference his lessons, reference his words, reference his jokes, tells me that like there's a leader that built a legacy that's long, long lasting and has knock on effects on a lot of people.
Right.
And so it was about 10 years ago that I made that switch in my mind where I said, like, as a leader, I'm not trying to be a good leader so that I continue to do well personally and professionally.
I'm being a good leader to leave a legacy.
Right.
And so I often think about, you know, like I go to the odd retirement party now and mine isn't going to be that soon, but when it does come, you wonder like, what are people going to say?
Right.
And I hope that long after I'm gone in this capacity that someone tells the odd story about Brent that they remember and that helped them.
Right.
And so for me, that's, that's always been a bit of the wind in the sails is leaving a legacy that will help people far beyond your time to see it.
Right.
So, you know, I've been, I've been very fortunate to have leaders in my life that have done that for me.
And if I can do that for a couple other people that work with me, that'll be 

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's incredible.
And it's such a wonderful way for people to reflect on their own leadership experience.
So many of us go to work and we might not be excited about the business issue we're tackling that day or the paperwork we're filing or whatever that is, but I'm sure coming into work and knowing that your intention is to leave a positive impact around the people that you've worked with, you know, that still helps you come home at the end of the day, feeling like you did good.

Brent Currie:
Right.
Right.
A hundred percent, I love it.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Well, listen, that was so helpful.
And again, thanks so much for taking the time.

Brent Currie:
Thank you, Christine.

Title: Progress is progress
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Atsushi Yasuda

Christine Laperriere:
Now this week, I have something kind of special.
A man by the name of Atsushi Yasuda reached out to me on LinkedIn and was very inspired by what I'm doing with the Best Boss Ever podcast.
Of course, I love getting notes like this, and I'm so thankful to say that I get them quite often actually.
So as he reached out, he said, hey, my dad has really been an inspiration.
Would you be interested in the story?
And so he sent me a letter this last weekend explaining, kind of writing up a thought process to his dad.
And I just thought it was so cool that I had to read it to you.
So here it goes.
He says, I would not call this your typical story about business.
It's not about an IPO, a Gartner Magic Quadrant, or a product launch.
It's about the grind and the sources of inspiration that create change that last a lifetime.
Almost 40 years ago, when I was 17, my dad got me a summer job where he worked.
I was so excited as the hourly wage far exceeded the 365 most of my friends were making at the time.
My dad, Yoshitaka, an engineer by training, worked at a sawmill in a small town in British Columbia.
He worked alongside the salt of the earth men.
I don't really recall any women out there in the lumber yard that operated the heavy machinery, debarkers, bandsaws, and planers that made the mill hum.
He was responsible for designing and engineering the series of conveyors, hydraulics, and connected machines that took the felled trees and turned them into neat bundles of dimensional lumber.
Think the lumber section at Home Depot times a thousand.
It's a good demonstration here.
As the quintessential Asian man, my dad was a few words.
His approach to work and life was that actions will always speak far more than words ever will.
But when he did speak, you knew to listen.
The 10 minute drive to work on our first day together was uneventful until my dad started talking.
People are going to be watching you, work hard, don't be lazy, don't sit when there is work that can be done.
Geez, I thought, quite the pep talk at 7 AM.
When we got to work, we walked into his office where he handed me a hard hat and a pair of heavy duty gloves.
He put his thermos away before we walked out and down the metal stairs to the yard.
We ended up in front of the biggest gnarliest pile of scrap metal I have ever seen.
Your job is to clean up this pile of metal.
It cannot be burned, so it has to be put into the dump truck to be taken away.
For about 30 seconds, I got excited thinking that I would be driving one of those big loader trucks to get it into the truck.
You are going to carry the scraps and toss it into the box.
Whatever is too heavy, you can put into the bucket of the loader, and I will get someone to lift it once you fill it.
WTF, that meant I had to heave heavy pieces of heavy gauge metal 15 feet into the air to clear the sides of the dump truck box.
I guess that was what I needed the hard hat for.
I spent the next month clearing up the pile.
I stopped going to the gym, which was a daily ritual at the time, but I couldn't lift my arms over my head anyways.
The progress, albeit glacial, was measured by the shrinking pile.
I evaluated every single piece before I touched it.
I had to figure out whether I could lift it.
If I could carry it, I knew I could throw it.
It soon turned into a personal challenge.
I would target a portion of the pile and would go at it until it was clean.
I remember sitting on the pile while I had my lunch.
I remember my boots, new when I started, had the leather scraped off at the toes to the bare steel that was underneath within the first week.
I worked my ass off and I got it done.
But with a bit of help from the load operator, I cleared the area of the yard and I met my dad's four-week target.
I can still carry the experience with me, but over the years the lessons have evolved.
It started off as just about the physical challenges.
But as I got older and moved from steel-toed boots to laptops, airport lounges, and PowerPoint slides, I realized far more impactful lessons my dad taught me.
They aren't anything that I haven't read elsewhere, but I know it has stuck for me.
Number one, nothing replaces hard work.
It doesn't matter your profession, it takes reps.
It is that simple.
Whether you are a developer, a banker, or a plumber, or the CEO, it requires a focused investment of energy to hone your craft.
And I call bullshit if anyone tells you it's easy.
Number two, do not sit where there is work to be done.
My dad taught me in his own way to constantly look for opportunity to bring value, to take initiative and not wait to be asked.
It seems pretty basic now, but I don't think it's as obvious as it may sound.
Number three, it will look like shit until it doesn't.
It's way too easy to get caught up in the work in progress.
The pile of scrap metal that doesn't seem to be getting any smaller.
But progress is progress regardless of pace.
And most things will look like a hot mess until it's done.
And number four, be humble, proud.
It felt good when the pile of metal was gone.
But there was no parade, no party.
I wasn't even sure if my dad said anything or noticed.
Years later, I learned that he did notice.
He didn't know the effort it took.
His coworkers also took notice, which made him proud.
If you are doing something for the accolades and the fanfare, the external recognition, it isn't the right reason.
Be proud of your accomplishments and do it for the person in the mirror.
In closing, my dad has been longtime retired, but he remains the same.
At 84, he focuses his energy on maintaining a pristine yard, paying close attention to all the small details, and is still a man of few words.
I can only hope I can pass along a crumb or two of wisdom to my own kids the way my dad did for me.
Thanks, Dad.
I hope you found that letter as inspiring as I did.
And of course, I had no choice, but I had to reach out to Atsushi and ask him if he could come talk to me a little bit on the show.
So now that you've heard the letter that was sent, I have Atsushi Yasuda on the show just to talk for a minute about the impact of that letter and kind of the the inspiration behind it.
So thank you so much for being on the show.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Oh, I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

Christine Laperriere:
So, you know, what was the inspiration when you saw the Best Boss Ever podcast?
Tell me a little bit about what went through your head.

Atsushi Yasuda:
It was funny because my first reaction was really about, oh, somebody should be writing about me.
I'm a good boss.
But then it was really more around reflecting, you know, I've been in the workforce 30 plus years now, really trying to think about it.
And I'm at a point in my career where I feel a lot of what I get satisfaction from is mentorship and coaching.
And so this is one of these takeaways was so who made an impact on me from a boss and leadership standpoint and tons of great folks, tons of great leadership.
But really the one that really kind of stuck out for me was my dad.
It feels a little bit different because it's not what I do, you know, as a livelihood.
You know, when I really start to think about it, there was a lot of lessons that I picked up from him that really that is still applying very relevant for me.
Right.
So that was kind of the impetus.

Christine Laperriere:
And what kind of person is he today?
You said he still works on his garden.

Atsushi Yasuda:
He's still he's been long retired.
I would say he's been retired trying to do the last time, I think, 20 plus years now.
He is his own man.
He could tell you what reflects what represents him is the way he retired.
I would say is I was actually home visiting over Christmas time.
And he kind of pulled me aside and says, you know, I could use your help with something, which is very rare for my dad.
And I said, sure.
What do you mean?
He says, I need you to write my resignation letter.
And I went, what do you mean?
He goes, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to retire after Christmas.
I went, OK.
But then he goes, don't tell your mother.
So this is what he thinks.
So that in a nutshell kind of reflects who he is as a person, he's still that, you know, he is a man of very few words.
And that's kind of how how I grew up with him.
I would say both my mother and father, they have been nothing more than supportive wholeheartedly for my brother and I.
But it is really one of those, I would say, quintessential Asian households where academics was kind of the priority and everything was a focus around, you know, making sure you get good grades, making sure you get a good education.
But that was kind of him.
Like he just did his business, obviously, very salt of the earth type of individual and didn't really kind of mince words.
So, you know, when he spoke, you listened.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that because, you know, some of us confuse leadership with talking.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Yeah, I would say it's the opposite, because if you're talking, all you're doing is you're just, you know, saying things that you already know by listening.
I think it's more about the the opportunity and the ability to hear other people's perspective.
So that, I think, is one of those things that I hold very true to myself.

Christine Laperriere:
Any other interesting things that he's taught you about leadership through the years?

Atsushi Yasuda:
Oh, I think it is one of those things about just I think it is about being humble.
And this is something that I take with me.
I'm not one of those individuals that I like.
I don't think I am in terms of that needs to be flashy.
I don't I don't crave the spotlight.
And he he was very much that way.
Like he, you know, your actions and your efforts and the results should speak for themselves.
And so it was really, you know, when you think about the politics that can typically come into play in a corporate environment.
That was really a disconnect for me, like growing up, because, you know, what I learned from from both my parents was really about, you know, do good work and it will kind of you will be rewarded for that.
And so I think that's one of the things that I really that I think I kind of wear as kind of my the way I conduct myself professionally.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Amazing that.
And you just were it sounds like really brought up with a true hard work ethic.
It's kind of like get up and keep adding value.
Right.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Oh, for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Don't just sit there and wait.
I mean, I can think of so many times where it's like somebody sitting and waiting.
And I hear a lot about taking initiative in that story.

Atsushi Yasuda:
It's funny.
One of my closest colleagues that I've known for 30 plus years, he continues to bring that piece as you.
You remember when you and I talked and I said, you know, you kept saying that you don't want to be paid unless you bring value.
And it's funny that it's something that was core to my beliefs very early on in my career.
And I still and it persists today.
And so when I work with clients, I'm constantly talking about bringing value.
Otherwise, you know, I shouldn't be here if I'm not bringing value to you and your business.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atsushi Yasuda:
So that is that is core to who I am and how I run my business.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And obviously has made you very successful.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Absolutely.
I like to.
Sure.
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
Yep.
Yep.
You can own it.
See, that's the humble thing.
You don't even want to own that.
You're still thinking, well, I could I could always do better.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Absolutely.
Yeah, for sure.
It is it has to be intentional.
And I think it is core.
It is true to who I am at a very essential level is that I'm surrounded by good people.
I'm surrounded by a good team.
They do the hard work.
They do the heavy lifting.
I'm just simply there to remove obstacles, impediments.
And that's kind of my function today.
And I feel that's a big part of the function of leadership is to really kind of support the team.
And I've heard people, you know, describe me as you're the type of leader that leads from behind.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Really, I had to think about it.
But that is very true.
Like, I really don't crave that limelight or kind of that spotlight at all.
Like, I don't shy away from it, but it certainly is not something that I need to feel satisfaction or to to kind of get really kind of get jazzed up over the course of the day.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Well, and leading from behind is another interesting one.
It's like this.
Where did we get the assumption that the leaders should be in the limelight?
But for some reason, we do.
Now you can understand why a lot of teams probably feel a little disengaged when the leaders taking the spotlight.
But leading from behind, you know, is easier said than done.
Right.
And so when you really do care more about the success of your team than your own ego.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Yes.
Yeah.
I think that's a big one.
The ego thing is is not something that I grew up with.
I think, again, that's core to who my dad is.
He does not crave or look for or has any level of ego within him.
He is true to his word.
And he kind of, you know, say what you mean and mean what you say type of approach.
And so I value that.
And you know what I took away from him.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Anything else you want to add is we're just wrapping up today.

Atsushi Yasuda:
I'll say like something about my dad very much a neophyte when it comes to technology, although I give him credit for doing online banking and things like that.
He still watches the news coming from Japan online on his computer.
I hope he appreciates and kind of will take a bit of a moment to give himself a pat on the back.
I hope that's kind of what he will give himself the opportunity to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Well, it sounds like he was an incredible influence on you.
And what's so neat is you're living a lot of his legacy.
So you're leading the same way he taught you to lead.
And so it's neat to see how that impacts so many people who get a chance to work with you and experience you.
They're getting a chance to experience that same.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Natural extension, I suppose.

Christine Laperriere:
Exactly.
Exactly.

Atsushi Yasuda:
That's cool.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's really cool.
Amazing.
Well, thank you again.

Atsushi Yasuda:
Thanks, Christine.
I appreciate the time.

Title: A guy named Guy
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Joanna Track

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have on a very special guest, a good friend of mine and a business colleague, Joanna Track, who is joining me.
I'm excited, Joanna, by the way.
I've been a customer of your businesses.
I've been a fan of yours.

Joanna Track:
Yeah, well, the feeling is mutual and I'm so excited.
I feel like, yeah, we can spend the whole podcast talking about all the ways we're connected and the things we've done.
We've worked in almost every capacity together.
So this was the natural next step.

Christine Laperriere:
I loved it.
And you obviously had someone that came to mind when we were talking about the Best Boss Ever podcast.
So just tell everybody where they can find you, a little bit about you.
And then I'm going to dive right into that big question.
Sure.

Joanna Track:
So, yes, well, my current chapter is as founder and partner in a boutique content marketing agency called Good Eggs & Co.
And we work with brands, primarily small medium businesses, which is what my passion is, helping them with all aspects of content marketing strategy and execution.
And that is after a long history, 20 plus years of being an entrepreneur with a number of businesses under my belt, including Sweetspot.ca and Elux and The Bullet.
And so, yes, a lot of experience doing my own thing.
But prior to that and a little bit in between have had a number of bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and as an entrepreneur, love it or not, we have many bosses.
I think of that.
I mean, my customer base is my, that's who I answer to.
So even if it's not in the same formal way that you think of corporate, you and I both know what it's like to work with a lot of different people and basically be trying to deliver.

Joanna Track:
Absolutely, you're always answering to somebody.
It's just a different type of relationship.

Christine Laperriere:
Exactly.
So I'm going to dive in with the question.
Who is your best boss ever and why?

Joanna Track:
Yes, so my best boss ever, absolutely no contest, was a gentleman named Guy, a guy named Guy.
A guy named Guy.
Who was my boss at Ogilvy, which was a large global ad agency that I worked for for about six years prior to jumping off and starting my entrepreneurial journey.
And I used to always say then, well, especially after the fact that if I were to ever work for anyone or anywhere again, it was really the only place I would ever go because the experience was so great, both the organization and the boss that I had.

Christine Laperriere:
That is amazing.
That's a pretty big testament.
So tell me more about this boss.

Joanna Track:
Yeah, so one of the things that made Guy the best boss ever was something he did even before I worked there.
So I was interviewing for jobs.
I was looking to make a change and I was working prior to that as a data analyst at the loyalty group, which is Air Miles.
OK, I felt like I was underutilized, like they were using my skill set at like the level, my abilities just was kind of stagnant.
So I was really looking to make a leap.
And but it was hard to sort of right size myself from this job that I felt was like a little junior to my capabilities.
And so I was interviewing for a bunch of jobs and I interviewed with Ogilvy and with a number of people, including Guy, and just the fact that he offered me this job, which, you know, most times, especially in advertising, you have to come already with the like you have to have done the job to get the job.
But he didn't.
He went on his feeling and what he felt.
I was a good fit and he saw the potential in me.
And so he gave me that chance, like to, you know, take the leap and try it.
And I really think that's one of the many testaments to what makes a great boss.

Christine Laperriere:
I think it's amazing when people can do just what you said.
They can interview you and instead of comparing it to a laundry list of things that you've already done, they can actually try to use their intuition, I guess, is probably the right word.
Their gut feel to see if they can take a chance on somebody.

Joanna Track:
Exactly.
And I mean, that is one of the many things I've taken with me in my career and as I've built my companies and how I've hired, because sometimes, yes, someone might not pick all the boxes on the skill set checklist.
But if you feel that they have the potential and they're a good fit and what we call in our world, a good egg, are they a good?
Then, you know, a good egg is malleable and you can teach people almost anything, but is this someone you want to work with every day and, you know, want to invest your time in because it's a two way street.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.
And so it sounds like during the interview process, right off the bat, he he was already betting on you and already seeing your potential.
Give me some more stories and examples.

Joanna Track:
Yeah.
So then the next thing happened very shortly thereafter.
So, you know, when you start at a new job, I always call it the idiot phase.
Like, you don't know where anything is.
You don't know what you don't know.
You don't know what to do.
And you kind of sit around for a bit, feeling unproductive and not useful because you just don't have a hang of things.
And then you look back later and you laugh.
But at the time.

Christine Laperriere:
You're learning something new.

Joanna Track:
Yeah.
So I was at Ogilvy for about three weeks and they had assigned me.
I was working on two accounts as like a mid level account management person.
But I was pretty much sitting on my hands for a lot of the time because I was just waiting for more stuff.
And then I started to get insecure and think, oh, I'm going to get fired.
Like they don't have work for me and agency life.
You know, it kind of ebbs and flows.
So I was getting really insecure.
And one day he called me and asked me to see me in his office.
And I was like, oh, I'm done.
And also, because, like I said, he gave me this job that I hadn't had the previous experience.
And now I'm sitting there doing nothing.
And I go in and he says, you know, we just received an RFP to pitch for FedEx Canada's direct marketing business.
This is so I was in Ogilvy one, which was the direct marketing arm.
So prior to the world of the days of Internet, this was, you know, direct mail, radio, all that.
So they have received an RFP from FedEx.
And he said, I'd like you to work with us on putting the pitch together.
OK, so now I'm working not just with him because he actually wasn't even my direct boss.
He was the managing director of Ogilvy one.
So at the time, I wasn't reporting directly to him.
So all this senior level management working on this pitch and me.
So definitely by far the most junior person in the room by many years.
And he just brought me into this pitch.
I think I mean, this is a long time ago, but let's just say it was a two week process of getting this pitch together.
And then I just assumed, OK, great.
They have what they need.
They're going to go pitch it.
And then he invited me to come, which also was exciting.
And then the day before, when they were doing like dress rehearsal, he said, OK, Joanna, so you're going to present this part.
And he assigned me a part.
And of course, I was so nervous.
And your level of management at FedEx.
And I've never done anything like this in my life.
And I honestly remember going into the pitch, being more nervous about the impression I was going to make on the senior team at Ogilvy and senior team at FedEx, because it was like all eyes.
Well, fast forward, we won the business and I managed that account for so many years.
And I mean, so many lessons were imparted on me from that experience.
And one of the things that I always talk about about what makes a great boss is putting, you know, your people center stage, not having a spotlight, letting other people and also letting people stretch themselves, giving them enough, not throwing them off the deep end to drown, but giving them enough of a stretch with a safety net where they can shine, try something new, stretch their skills, learn more and not feel the need to take the credit or steal the show, which unfortunately, I've had more bad bosses than good bosses.
And the constant theme of the bad bosses are these inflated egos who take all the credit, who, you know, they push people down so they can be up.
And Guy is was and still is the antithesis of that.
He was happy to give me a chance.

Christine Laperriere:
To elevate you, despite where he should be sitting and really quick.
So when you did pitch, how did he think it went?
I'm just kind of curious.
Did he give you feedback after?

Joanna Track:
Yeah, I mean, he thought I did a fabulous job.
But one of the other things actually that you just hinted at that I wanted to bring up was the way he gave feedback, not just at the pitch, but all through the years that I worked there.
He's so thoughtful with his feedback.
It was actually a joke in the agency because he's a British man and has got very much that kind of absent minded professor kind of aura to him.
And if you went into his office, either just to ask him a question about something or say you were showing him a deck and he was going to give his feedback on it.
He's so thoughtful that he would take these long pauses.
He wouldn't say anything.
And what felt like a minute is going by.
Everyone used to joke.
They'd be like, do we interrupt him?
Do we like what do we do?
Like, he's just quiet.
But like when you think about it, now that I'm more grown up and a leader, he's so not ahead of his time.
But I mean, it's just what people don't do.
But he would take the time.
He wasn't worried about the like, is this uncomfortable?
He was so careful with his words and how he said stuff and really thought things through.
And it really I still think about it to this day, you know, when I'm in a hurry to like interrupt someone or jump in or or react emotionally to something, I just like sit back and be like, can you take a breath?
Can you take a pause?
Can you allow silence for a few seconds, a minute, whatever it takes?
It was pretty amazing.
And then, of course, everything he always said was so fair and balanced and not emotional.

Christine Laperriere:
It sounds like he taught you how to be a good listener just through setting his example.

Joanna Track:
Yeah, he definitely taught me that.
And I always have said for many years that, you know, I actually got my MBA, but I said that at Ogilvy, I got my Ph.D.
not only in branding, but in leadership.
I learned everything there that I have taken with me throughout the rest of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
So I'm just going to make space.
Do you have any other?
I mean, these are all such great stories.
Anything else that you want to add about your experience with him?

Joanna Track:
I mean, I would just say, I mean, that everything that went on was always consistent, like it never changed.
It never wavered.
Always giving opportunities, always hearing things out.
Also, instead of having to ask for the raise, ask for the promotion.
But they were so proactive, not only Guy, but it just felt that the energy there was they recognized talent.
They, you know, you weren't you never wondered where you stood or what you needed to do differently.
It was just it was the most clear cut communicative environment.
And another testament to that is that 20 plus years later, there are still there are reunions of that like cohort of people that work there at that time.
There are still people working there who were there at that time.
But guys since retired, but, you know, we had a huge reunion.
It was right before Covid and there was over a hundred people showed up.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Joanna Track:
Which says a lot to go back to a company you worked at 20 years ago just to see everybody.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
That goes to speak to the type of culture that it built and how tight knit you all became.
Plus, the thing that I always find so interesting is if you work for an amazing organization with great leaders, you can all go spiral off and do the careers you were meant to do and stay really connected.
Right.
So how many times, I mean, the way you speak about Ogilvy is very passionate.
Like, what a great testament.
You know, you're not a customer, you're somebody who worked there and you have such high thoughts.
That's that's not normal.

Joanna Track:
Yeah, no, I mean, and I've always said if I wasn't an entrepreneur, it's probably the only place I would have wanted to work again.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's amazing.
So in my business, as you know, a lot of organizations love to ask the question, what is the return on investment for building up best bosses?
I always kind of try to understand what is the impact of the business.
And if you had to guess, just even being an entrepreneur, knowing the lessons you bring to your own organizations, like, what do you think the return on investment is?

Joanna Track:
I mean, yeah, I mean, it more than pays for itself, because, you know, when you're a good leader and a good boss, then you train and mentor other people, not only in how to do the hard skills of their job or the technical skills, but the soft skills of how to manage situations, how to treat people.
And that continues to pay it forward.
So, you know, one would think that, you know, the ROI becomes up and up because, you know, I, you know, have imparted my lessons on people who then, you know, carry it.
I mean, you know, Samantha, who's my right now, has worked for me for almost 18 years in one capacity or another.
And now she went from being my intern 18 years ago, crazy to my business partner.
And now we pass it on to all the people that work with us, a certain style of work.
And so it continues to spread.
And hopefully, you know, it's like an antidote to the bad bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
And that's why I'm so passionate about this topic, as I'm just convinced if we can somehow keep lobbying for not just acceptable leadership, but amazing leadership.
Like when you explain your story about Guy, this is how I know it's a best boss story.
Is it changed the way you behaved in the future for the better?
Like you try to act like him in tough situations.
So just the way you explained him being very quiet, being very mindful, listening, very thoughtful with his words.
When we see somebody that we're really impressed by and we really look up to, that cements and impacts us.

Joanna Track:
People actually joke all the time now that when they speak to Sam on the phone, if they don't see her, they said, I actually sometimes can't tell you two apart.
You sound so much the same.
And I don't think it's just like our tone.
It's the things we say.
And so I would guess that probably travels further beyond Sam and I and to all the other people that we work with.

Christine Laperriere:
For sure.
I mean, that's and makes sense.
Right.
And then, I mean, when you think of you're not so good bosses, I heard ego, you know, I guess, what is the impact to the bottom line on the not so good bosses?

Joanna Track:
Turnover, which is very expensive, less productivity and bad behavior, I think, begets bad behavior.
So, you know, if I beat up on you, then you beat up.
Everyone's trying to like then it becomes a blame party.
As opposed to like rising up, which is everybody down.
You know, I mean, I don't have the stats offhand, but you and I both know that, you know, companies that are run well see better profits and the output speaks for itself.
And especially well, I was going to say, especially these days, but always people's mental health matters.
No job, no amount of money in the world is worth being miserable all day, being stressed, feeling uncomfortable, feeling beat down and not appreciated.
And I always say to employment is a two way street, even though I may be paying you, it goes both ways.
You are not my my slave or anything like that.
You know, I always say like the difference between a good boss and a bad boss, a good boss treats their employees like comrades, not soldiers.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Right.

Joanna Track:
You are together in it.
And I'm asking you to do a task and I'm paying you for that task.
And in return, I'm giving you an environment in which to do the task.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's a really good way of thinking about it.
The comrades versus soldiers.
Right.
And it makes so much sense.
But for some reason, I always say like the industrial age gave us this very hierarchical style of leadership.
And what you're seeing is nobody wants it anymore.
We're not doing jobs that even require it.

Joanna Track:
Right.
And also, yeah, I mean, people are just not standing for it.
There's, you know, there's a lot of competition.
There's most people are now awake to the fact that, you know, there's something better out there.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Joanna Track:
But up with it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
This is amazing.
I am kind of curious.
I know you're a very big advocate for female entrepreneurs.
And I would just love to pick your brain for a few minutes.
Like, what have you learned?
What do you want people to hear about?
Because you've gained a lot of wisdom in that space.
I know that's something you're passionate about.

Joanna Track:
Yeah, I'm extremely passionate.
You know, our company right now, 90 percent of our client base is female led businesses.
So we have one or two clients that are led by men, but the rest are female led entrepreneurs.
And I think, you know, I sit on the board of directors of the forum.
As female entrepreneurs.
So, yeah, I mean, from my own experiences of talking about paying it forward, I find it so critical to to support this ecosystem.
And I think the struggle, unfortunately, that female entrepreneurs still have is that discriminatory attitude towards, you know, not getting treated with the same seriousness of women.
We still hold the bag on most of the household stuff.
You know, having to do that and run a company, you know, you wouldn't.
Still, to this day, people don't expect that much from a man.
And as you and I both know, running a company is really bloody hard.
Taxing physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and then layer on top of that, being a woman, you know, less access to financial capital, less access to certain supports.
And I do find often, you know, women, I want to say are better leaders, but unfortunately, in my experience, my worst bosses were women.
I think that's where it, you know, gets like egos threatened, all those kind of negative feelings.
But I do find that where women can do better is they tend to communicate better.
They tend to be more organized.
And organization, I think, is a critical part of being a good boss.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.

Joanna Track:
Remembering where things were left, documenting things, all those things like they translate into good leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Amazing.
Well, what would be your biggest tip for anybody listening who wants to be a best boss ever, given everything that you shared today?

Joanna Track:
So actually, it comes from one of my favorite quotes of all time of David Ogilvy, who has a book of incredible quotes and thoughts on not just advertising, on leadership.
And he always says, you know, hire people smarter than you.
And then you'll have a company of giants.
Nice.
Because that relates to the taking out the ego, you know, focusing on the output and letting people shine.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Thank you so much, Joanna.

Joanna Track:
Oh, it's my pleasure.
This was so fun.

Title: The impact of safety
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Naomi Titleman

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have Naomi Titleman, and I'm excited that I've had a chance to interact with Naomi through the years. We've been in Women of Influence together. We got a chance to know each other through AmEx. We've had lots of crossed paths, and so it's exciting that you mentioned that you have a best boss ever and that you were willing to take the time to come on the show. Thank you so much. 

Naomi Titleman:
Thank you for having me, Christine. It's great to be here. 

Christine Laperriere:
Can you just so everybody knows, give us the 30 seconds on you. Tell us. 

Naomi Titleman:
Sure. So I spent the first two chapters of my career in corporate. I was first at a big firm at Deloitte, and I'll talk about my best boss ever from Deloitte. Then I transitioned into corporate HR. So I was in the HR space for about seven years, most recently as the head of HR of American Express Canada. And then seven years ago, I went out on my own. I started my advisory business, Collaborativity, where I help large organizations. Actually, organizations of all sizes is really grapple with this new world of work. So help them solve problems to do with their talent strategy, really solving for the new world of work we live in. Also have a business with my partner, Mark Edgar, called Future Forward, where we have a podcast newsletter and a community for senior HR professionals. You're welcome to check out my website, futureforward.com. And we are really empowering leaders and HR professionals to make work better. So that's really our mission. 

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. And that's why we have so much alignment. I love it. So just, I'm gonna dive in. I go straight for the jugular. So who is your best boss ever?
And tell us a little bit about him or her. 

Naomi Titleman:
So my best boss ever, his name is Chuck. And when I first joined Deloitte as a clueless, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed Canadian in the Big Apple in New York City, I remember sitting on the proverbial beach kind of looking around. I mean, for those consultants listening, you know what it's like to be on the beach, especially when you're new to an organization and you're like, they may fire me tomorrow. I may not have a visa tomorrow, being in New York. And Chuck kind of, I don't know how he found me, but he kind of took me under his wing. And all of a sudden, I was part of his posse. And we worked with a lot of financial services companies back in the day. It was before Sarbanes-Oxley Times. So again, anybody who remembers the Sarbanes-Oxley Times, Post-Enron, Post-Anderson, we were working on that type of work even before Sarbanes-Oxley came into play. And Chuck was my mentor. He was my leader. He was actually my boss's boss, but he was just really instrumental at helping me build the confidence I needed as a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed Canadian in the Big City of New York. 

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. So tell me, how did Chuck do that?
Give me specifics. 

Naomi Titleman:
So I think what was great is that he really believed in me even though I didn't believe in myself at all, right?
So like I mentioned, I was new to the work world, had never, I mean, the jobs that I had had in university had nothing to do with consulting. We were doing risk management consulting, and he really empowered me to learn in the way I wanted to learn. He really invited me to meetings and allowed me to observe what a good meeting looked like. He also rolled up his sleeves and took my decks and I remember made big red circles around things and sometimes crossed out his edits and wrote the word step, which I never knew what it meant, but he taught me what the word step means, which means disregard my edit in Chuck language. So, you know, it just runs the gamut from being like in the weeds with us, even though he was a senior manager at the time and went on to have a very, very, very successful career at Deloitte, and also just being that kind of visionary, you know, strategic thinker, relationship builder with our clients. He kind of ran the gamut, which I really appreciated. 

Christine Laperriere:
So, was there a time where you messed up or you did something wrong and Chuck had to give you some feedback?

Naomi Titleman:
I mean, I'm sure I messed up lots and lots and lots of times. I don't recall a specific example, but I just remember never really being kind of fearful of Chuck's leadership and his disciples also. So, there were people who were, like I mentioned, there were managers between me and Chuck, who was the senior manager, and those managers seemed to take his lead in terms of how to lead in a motivating, empowering kind of firm, but fair way. So, I don't remember a specific example, because this is like 20 years ago at this point, but what I do remember is just feeling empowered and feeling that I was able to make those little mistakes and even some big ones and not kind of being massively penalized for it. 

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right. I mean, what you said is really interesting. You know, sometimes they say you won't remember what a person said or did, but you remember how they make you feel. And I feel like that's exactly what I'm picking up on is you were not fearful, which is interesting. That means you felt safe enough that you could learn and grow and try things without worrying about, oh, God, today's the day I'm gonna get the axe. 

Naomi Titleman:
Like, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And he did a few things where he really stuck his neck out for me. I remember having an uncomfortable encounter with, you know, a male colleague, and he kind of stepped right in there and coached me through it and also spoke to the male colleague about it. He also, I mean, one of the biggest things he did, I mean, a few huge things he did. So one was he was my leader during the time of 9-11. So he was, again, that he was vulnerable enough that we saw the emotion come through, but had this unshakable confidence that we were gonna get through things as a team. And I remember, you know, going to the backup site for our client in Jersey City and kind of sitting there and kind of looking at each other and saying, now what?
And Chuck was just that amazing leader to really guide us through these very challenging times. So that was a huge pivotal moment in my career, I believe, that had I had a different type of leader, you know, I may not have even gone back to New York after 9-11 to tell you the truth. 

Christine Laperriere:
Right, were your offices in the downtown New York core then?


Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, they were in the World Financial Center. Chuck has his own story of that day. We've recently kind of shared our stories of the day. It's one of those things that we hadn't really talked about it until very recently, until our kind of mid-adult hood years. But yes, and our client also was in downtown New York as well as in Jersey City. So I'll never forget, I think Chuck was one of the people to go into the World Financial Center to recover our computers, because at the time we all kind of put our computers in our lockers and went home for the day. And, you know, that's what we did. So Chuck just showed a lot of bravery and a lot of just excellent leadership during that time. That only in retrospect do I realize, right?
I realized it at the time, but not the impact that it's had on my career and on so many others throughout his career. 

Christine Laperriere:
Wow, wow, that's an incredible story and example. You know, I'm thinking of, I had one of my worst bosses ever during 9-11. 

Naomi Titleman:
Oh, that's unfortunate. 

Christine Laperriere:
You know, to your point, there was no, I didn't feel any safer or any more secure or any more, you know, it was almost like, let's ignore this thing that's happening in the world, which to me felt crazy, you know. We can't just ignore this, right?
And so it was, it's just so interesting when you hear, I always say like that day really stood out to me as a sign of someone's leadership. 

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. 

Christine Laperriere:
You know, so to you, that's a permanent mark, right?

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, it sure is. 

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. So in both of our businesses, we're asking companies to invest in building awesome leaders. And so I love to ask the question, if you could try to wrap your head around, what is the impact to the bottom line when you have the best boss ever versus when you don't?


Naomi Titleman:
It's a great question. I mean, I think Chuck can probably, probably count and also not know about how many amazing leaders he's developed and how many amazing leaders they've developed and how much business has been brought into Deloitte. I mean, he's a career Deloitte person. I mean, he's had so much impact on that company. He eventually, he had a few amazing roles, but the most recent role he had, or one of the more recent roles he's had is the CEO of the risk advisory business. And I can only imagine, you know, through his relationships and through his building of leaders, how much that's impacted the bottom line. I mean, without a doubt. 

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, I mean, in a way, it's kind of, you know, when you're talking about Chuck particularly, and then I'm thinking about how his leadership impacted you, it's almost like free leadership training for all of those that are working for Chuck. As they watch him lead and they watch how he behaves, don't you feel that influences everybody else?
Like you said, so many other people's careers were influenced by his leadership. 

Naomi Titleman:
Yes, 100%. I mean, one of the other things that he did for me specifically, that wasn't really kind of the cool thing to do back then, is he sponsored me to go and do my MBA. And there wasn't a formal program in place. And he basically stuck his neck out and said, hey, this is someone who I believe in and I want to send her to do her MBA. And he encouraged me to apply. And then with my husband, I need to give my husband some credit too. So he also encouraged me to apply. And then he said, we're gonna make this happen. We're gonna figure out a way to get you to do your MBA, you know, partially funded by Deloitte, which was amazing and not something that, again, we didn't have a formal program in place. And then when I finished my MBA, I had to have the tough conversation with him. I do want to come back to Deloitte, but I'm actually really interested in the people side of the business. I actually don't want to come back to risk management. And I thought that was gonna be a brutal conversation. And he was like, great, let's make that happen. I'm happy you want to come back to the Deloitte family. So just a really powerful example of sponsorship in the works. It's not, again, something that we talked about in those words back then, but in retrospect, I so appreciate the risk he took to do that for me. 

Christine Laperriere:
And, you know, again, here's another interesting example of the impact, right?
We have retention of incredibly high potential talent. That's what we have right there. So even if you didn't stay in risk, you came back to Deloitte and you still added value those additional years because you were sponsored and you were cared for and looked after, right?
And so I think that's a really, again, great example of where the impact is of having these type of leaders inside an organization. 

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, absolutely. And I still, I always say I have green dot in my blood, right?
Like I haven't been at Deloitte since 2009, but I'm still such a big advocate for Deloitte. The network of people that I've been in touch with is just outstanding. And that's because of the relationships that I built while I was there with the amazing leaders I've had, both Chuck and others. 

Christine Laperriere:
Right, amazing. And it's hard to measure what the impact of that, but there's so much relationship currency there, right?
So if somebody wanted to go to Deloitte, you'd refer them in for sure. If you see high potential talent, right?
There's the ability to connect. They can leverage you, obviously. So again, these are all those things you can't measure and I find people want measurement to make them feel better about some of these investments. But when you're giving this example of Chuck, there's so many impacts of that great leader throughout organizations and relationships and just the way people wake up in the morning and probably feel about their career. 

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, absolutely. 

Christine Laperriere:
So when you think of a worst boss or many, maybe, I just love to know kind of what are the traits or tributes of one that just didn't work well with you?

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, I mean, I've been very fortunate that I've had great leaders. I mean, definitely things I learn, both in terms of how I want to behave and how I don't wanna behave. I wouldn't classify any of my leaders as the worst boss ever. But I would say, you know, that piece about not feeling anxious around Chuck's leadership and not being anxious about making mistakes. Definitely had other leaders where I felt more anxious about making mistakes and more worried about the micro because that's where the focus was as opposed to let's focus on the bigger picture. And yes, we have to get the micro good and let's not let perfect get in the way of good enough. And so that's what I would say. Leaders who operate kind of by policy and by mandate and by iron fist and by perfection, that's not gonna motivate anybody to do good work. And in fact, I mean, listen, some people are motivated. You know, you think about sports coaches and some people are motivated by people yelling in their face, but many people are not. And so really figuring out what motivates people to do their best work and what does the exact opposite is really important for leaders to take a hold of. And so I would say emotional intelligence is one of those things that can, I mean, it can't be overlooked because it's so critical that we understand how people are reacting to us and how people are performing as a result of reacting to us. So I know I didn't directly answer your question because I've been very fortunate, but I'd say in those circumstances where I'm feeling, oh, I can't do this unless it's perfect. It's probably not what I would have wanted to emulate in my leadership style. 

Christine Laperriere:
You know, and you're making a really good point because I work with a lot of fantastic leaders who are driven perfectionists, not that they are worst bosses or anything like that, but just by nature have a very strong perfectionism. And interestingly enough, they hire great talent that also have that perfectionist in them. And so what you end up with is this stack up of perfectionism, right?
Where people are working until the midnight hour trying to make it perfect, then it gets handed to a perfectionist who sends it back for eight hours of revision because it's not perfect. You know what I mean?
And so maybe it's like for me when I hear that it's kind of an efficiency along with a career enjoyment. Like it's just nobody loves that thread of like it's not going to be good enough no matter how many hours I put in. 

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's a great point. 

Christine Laperriere:
So if everybody listening is learning how to become or aspiring to be a best boss, tell us what would be your tip for them or the nugget that you really want them to take away from our conversation today?

Naomi Titleman:
I think empowerment is a thread that we're seeing in a lot of different areas in our space these days. So, you know, if we think about new ways of working, hybrid working models, there's got to be an element of empowerment, right?
If we think about, you know, delegation. So delegation isn't drop it on someone's lap and then leave. It's really being there as a support and as a sponsor and as an advisor and as a coach. So really perfecting that balance is really critical. So, you know, empowerment is my word. It doesn't mean delegate and leave. It means be there as a support and don't create that system of fear where people feel that, okay, well, I've been delegated to but not really because they're going to micromanage me through it. So I know it's a long-winded way of answering your question but I'm seeing a lot of trickiness around empowerment lately, especially as we're still in the conversation of new ways of working and empowering people to work when and where they're most productive, which is an entirely other podcast episode. 

Christine Laperriere:
Right, amazing. Well, listen, I love that you've given people something really to think about as they leave this conversation. And again, so glad that they can find you. Remind me really quick. What's your Instagram handle?

Naomi Titleman:
So Instagram and LinkedIn is Future Forward, F-U-T-U-R-E-F-O-H-R-W-A-R-D. And you can also find me on LinkedIn personally. 

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Thank you, Naomi. Have a good one. Thanks so much. Thanks so much, Christine. If you wanna hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast

Title: Leveraging powerful personalities
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Lule Demmissie

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have Lule Demissay with me, and I'm really excited about this conversation.
We connected over LinkedIn.
She had a great best boss ever story.
And so this is probably one of my favorite formats where I get a chance to just find out from somebody who who just heard the concept and felt inspired by it, who is your best boss.
So thank you, Lule.
Thank you for joining me.

Naomi Titleman:
Oh, my pleasure.
Thanks for having me.
I'm glad we connected.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm so glad we connected.
And just so everybody in the audience knows, kind of tell us a little bit about who you are just before we dive in.
Yeah.
So my name is Lule Demmissie, and I am the U.S.
CEO of a fintech called eToro, which is a trading platform that offers self-directed investing instruments like stocks, options and other things in the U.S.
as well as globally.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing, amazing.
And so I'm going to dive right in.
So tell me, who is your best boss ever?

Naomi Titleman:
I think it would be ungenerous of me to say it's just one boss.
I've had a collection of people that are either my direct managers or, you know, a few bosses up that ended up being like a mentor, mentor slash boss that really impacted my life.
Just to give you a little bit of backstory, I'm from Ethiopia originally, so I'm a naturalized immigrant of the United States.
So my first best boss was about five years into my time outside of business school, I was sponsored by a gentleman to be able to be a permanent resident in the U.S.
because of the work I was doing.
And he was so generous in the way that he apprenticed me and made sure that I learned the skills he did.
One of the things that I learned, like some of the best bosses, is that they don't hoard knowledge.
For a lot of people, I feel like they think that knowledge is the thing they have to hold on to create value in what they do.
And he was the exact opposite.
He was so generous in the way he apprenticed me in the micro things and the macro things.
And then he was really generous in terms of giving me opportunity to practice it out loud, whether it was presenting or being the lead in something.
And so it was really interesting.
And it was also something that taught me how, you know, your best bosses, your mentors, they come in different shapes and sizes.
He and I could not have been any more different.
He was from Connecticut, one of those, like, really rishy-pishy sounding towns.
His favorite sport was golf.
I know nothing about golf.
And yet we were kindred spirits.
And it was a lesson also in the fact that there's a core humanity when you find somebody who's a really good mentor or boss that really can connect to anybody on the planet.

Christine Laperriere:
So I have to ask, what do you think was his inspiration to sponsor you and to mentor you?
Here he has this person that, you know, is from a completely different part of the world.
So not only are you learning business, but you're also learning kind of the culture and the way U.S.
business operates, right?
So what would be his inspiration to take you under his wing like that?

Naomi Titleman:
I think that he really gravitated to my work ethic.
He also saw how I didn't hoard what I learned.
I think, you know, for a lot of people who are generous with their knowledge, they're a little bit more judicious about sharing it with people who are also going to share it with others, right?
I think he spent his time with me because he probably felt like he was sprouting another person in his image of somebody who was going to be hardworking, strong work ethic, which he had, but also who would pass it on, if you will.
Part of it is, you know, because I grew up in so many different places, early on, by the time I was 18, I grew up in like four different countries slash continents.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Naomi Titleman:
So I learned how to embody the person's story, how to live in their space.
And I find that if somebody is really sort of going to connect bridges and tunnels to you, that that disarms them, that makes them more open.
And so I think he appreciated that, that I didn't come in assuming I was not going to have, as I said, kindred spiritness with him, that I was interested in what he was doing and saying, and I didn't let perceived identity sort of blocks not to have that connection.
And I think that that was appealing to him.

Christine Laperriere:
That's really amazing because we're always trying to challenge leaders to think about who are you going to take under your wing and groom, right?
How it's an important part of a leader's responsibility to sponsor great talent.
And so when I hear that, it just tells me, you know, it's really neat that he picked you and invested in you and gave you that time.
Can you tell us some stories and examples, you know, if we're trying to emulate that great behavior that he brought?
You know, give me some stories and examples of how that looked.

Naomi Titleman:
So part of it would be how he would, there was one situation where I had to put together a pitch, if you will, for a particular strategy we were pursuing.
And he took time to have me tell the story back and forth to him, that apprenticeship that comes to it.
He was a good mix of like very blunt feedback where it didn't work because I didn't need anybody to coddle me, but at the same time, you know, was very supportive and that sort of old adage of what improv artists tell you, he was a very much an and person.
That also is a mindset that really was I learned from him, the idea of like building up somebody while you're still giving them incredibly, you know, tough feedback.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.
Well, and interestingly enough, it sounds like one of the things that you'll hear over and over is if a best boss is coming from a really good place of trying to build you up, that tough feedback is welcomed.

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, I think it does take a certain, you know, I think that you have to calibrate it with people.
Some people don't have the thick skin to be able to handle it, but you're right in the sense that, you know, when we have that feeling of being able to be vulnerable to people, we're going to be able to hear them more.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.
So what other bosses came to mind?
It sounds like you couldn't pick just one.

Naomi Titleman:
Oh, my goodness, I can.
I mean, and I would love to tell you a few more.
So there was a CEO of a company I worked at called TD Ameritrade.
His name was Tim Hockey, and he's your fellow Canadian.
He was honestly one of the wisest people I had encountered.
The level of time he took to share what he learned, share what he knew, and asked questions as you thought out loud, and taught me the art of helping somebody think through problems, whether it was their own sort of mental block or whether it was an actual business problem through the art of answering and asking questions.
That's what I learned from him.
He was a great reader.
He read a lot of books, and he would share what his readings were, and I love books as well.
I love reading whether it's about self-improvement, behavioral science, business, fiction, history, the whole gamut, and he had that kind of sort of wide swath appetite, and he would share his books, and then he would literally have a 15-minute book review conversation with me sometimes.
I think that that's the other thing.
Bosshood is not about just the work.
It's about how somebody taps into your humanity and what is your interest and connecting on that, and he was really good at that, even though he wasn't my direct manager.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
I hear great leaders talk about being really well read and then using those ideas just to inspire more conversation, more thought.
I think lots of us love that intellectual candy.
We like that new idea or something new to chew on, and so what a great way that he could inspire you on any given day of the week.

Naomi Titleman:
And he passed on that habit even more.
I mean, I loved reading before that, but it was a habit I really fortified after having encountered him.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And then who else?

Naomi Titleman:
And then my last boss was, my current boss is wonderful as well, but my last boss was a woman.
She was the head of a fairly sizable consumer bank, and I ran the investment business under her, and she was formidable.
She was like a lioness.
She was both full of heart and full of head at the same time.
And what I really appreciated being under her stewardship was it really unleashed my desire to practice courage.
I've always loved the idea of being courageous.
I failed a lot when I was younger, so I learned it through that realm.
I think that if you fail a lot, you either will be highly depressed or you become courageous.
I chose the other path, but she really taught me the art of courage in business, the art of courage in managing people and groups of people, and allowed me to practice it on my own terms.
A lot of times when you work for a very big personality, sometimes their personality can not have room for others.
You have to fashion yourself to that person's style because they are such a big personality.

Christine Laperriere:
Exactly.

Naomi Titleman:
She was a master of being able to fill a room with her style, but allow other big personalities to thrive in her orbit.

Christine Laperriere:
That is talent.

Naomi Titleman:
That is incredible talent.
And again, part of it, as I said to you, is I really try hard to go where people are at.
And I find that when I do that, the relationship starts from a place of not judging.
And so they become more generous as well in the way they approach the relationship.
So it wasn't always like that for everyone, but me and her were like that.
And it was wonderful.
I went through the pandemic years with her, and I'm in retail trading.
And you can imagine retail trading had a huge upsurge.
We gained in usership in just during the pandemic period what we gained the last 10 plus years.
It was a tenfold growth in a blip of a time.
That was really adventurous.
And it had all sorts of interesting benefits and also challenges.
And she really let me sort of stretch my wings and be able to sort of drive the bus.
And that was really like, that was amazing.
That is what I learned is like how to, because I'm a strong personality.
So how to be a strong personality while you celebrate others that are strong personalities in the room.

Christine Laperriere:
That's a very interesting and very cool concept that I don't think a lot of people talk about or surface very often.
And you're exactly right.
When you bring these really powerful personalities together, it's like any sports team, right?
You can have all the best individual players, but if that team doesn't know how to play together, it's a failure.

Naomi Titleman:
And yet, when you have strong personalities that know how to play together, boy, do they move mountains, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Naomi Titleman:
So the amplification force, the effect is really high when you have that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So can you give us any tips or specific examples of things that you saw them do that really helped drive some of those bigger ideas home, like the art of courage and leveraging these brilliant powerful personalities?
Give me some of the tips of like, how did this person actually do this?

Naomi Titleman:
It's interesting.
The more I live on this earth, the more I realize so much of that is titration of little things you do and not necessarily some big playbook, if you will.
Leadership, in my opinion, is something you do every minute.
And so every micro decision you take to interact with somebody is an expression of what kind of leader you are.
So the one thing I'd say is like, so I'll give you an example.
So with her, I had made a massive business decision that brought the company to a particular point where that decision didn't work out.
And I called her up, I think on a Friday night, midnight, and I said, it's not going to work out.
And we were about to lose quite a bit of money.
And again, by this time, I had also learned sort of the tenets of leadership of the buck stopping here and leaders take all the failures and spread all the glory, right?
So I opened that playbook and I fully expected her to agree with me.
And I said, you know, this is no one's fault.
This buck stops with me.
If you have to do a playbook of what went wrong, it stops with me.
The team did an amazing job.
They went over and above, et cetera, and she listened to me.
And I said, and if you want me to resign, and I'd be happy to, right?
I don't want to have a situation where there's a blame circle here.
This is just, you know, that's what business is.
We make bets and sometimes they don't work out.
And she said, what the hell are you talking about?
Like, why do you think I hired you?
Like, she's like, this is what happens.
Leaders make bets and what you just reacted as is the reason why there is no way in hell.
I would first of all like you.
And that was also really valuable for me to know that I worked for a leader that had that central sort of ethos of appreciating that the buck stops here that appreciated that they don't roll crap downhill, right?
And it made me realize how deliberate she was in hiring me because I showed that of myself in the process.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Naomi Titleman:
And it's great to see it in action when it mattered, when there was a loss.
When there was, when it was hurting and she could have just said.
I learned courage, right?
I learned how to be courageous.
Courage is useless in words alone, right?
It is actually tested when there's something to lose, right?
When there's something lost.

Christine Laperriere:
You know what I hear?
There is an unconditional backing of you, which is really cool when I think of, if you think of like parents and the way kids experience love, it's like very different if we get conditional love or unconditional love.
Do you know what I mean?
And when she's saying, listen, I hired you for you and your leadership, not because I knew every single day you were going to make every perfect decision and see that into the future.
You know what I mean?
We just, we couldn't hire somebody on micro things.

Naomi Titleman:
It is very rare that they do that on big, big mistakes, right?
And you're right.
I don't know if it was unconditional because she was tough on me on a lot of things, like it gets back to like critique, et cetera.
I don't know if it was so much unconditional as it was value driven.
And sometimes I think people assume, like the reason I'm kind of shy from that unconditional word is sometimes people assume not being criticized is being unconditional, right?
And they can't hear critique in a way that is essentially trying to make them better, right?
And so the unconditional, I'm always shy from words of like unconditional or safe, because I often tell people like, there's no winning without risk.
There's no winning without knowing that some conditions can break things, but it's not really on the right wavelength when it comes to values.

Christine Laperriere:
It just, is there something really cool about the fact that she still valued you as a team member in that exact moment?
She hadn't decided to kick you off the team.
She didn't say, oh, you know, you missed the winning touchdown.
You know, we're going to renegotiate your contract next year.
You know what I mean?
It was like- 

Naomi Titleman:
Precisely.
And it's so funny because she's also like, most leaders have to let go of people, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Sure.

Naomi Titleman:
In your career.

Christine Laperriere:
That's what you do, yeah.

Naomi Titleman:
But what's interesting is the art I learned from her and from many others is that those decisions actually are made in the calm of day, not in the heat of failure.
And the heat of failure when you do those things actually signals to the rest of the workforce that courage is punished.

Christine Laperriere:
I really, really love that.
And I work with that on my own clients all the time where we talk about the state of mind people are in when they make big decisions.
And I think you just nailed it, right?
It's just that self-awareness or that emotional intelligence that allows you to make decisions from the right position, right?
The right state of mind.
That's amazing.
So now I'm just going to ask your opinion.
I work with a lot of organizations who are making decisions over investing dollars and building up best bosses and amazing leaders.
I always like to say, what is the impact to the bottom line when you have a best boss ever in the business versus not?

Naomi Titleman:
I think that more than even compensation, people want to be seen, valued, and developed.
I'm not saying people want to be underpaid, but I think that compensation becomes the only conversation in the absence of those things.
And so the price you pay for disruption and turnover and so many other things, and just our work life is the most of our lives.
And just the mental health you provide and the cultural health you provide when you aspire to be a good leader is insurmountable, right?
It's just unbelievable.
And so it's incalculable, I mean.
And so I think that it has, one day maybe we'll be able to have the metrics to be able to quantify this in a proper way that the bean counters will understand.
But I think that ultimately, the only people that think in the form of compensation are the people that are not investing in being that kind of leader.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, I completely agree.
And when you think in your career of leaders that you worked with that maybe were more of a challenge for you to work with, they don't have to be the worst case stereo, but just ones that were a challenge, what are some of the things that they did that didn't work well for you or made it harder for you to be your amazing talented self?

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah, you know, it's interesting.
I think that I would say that part of having a bad boss is where you are in your mental framework as well.
Like if I had a bad boss now, I think I wouldn't be in the same state that when I used to have bad bosses, right?
Because I wasn't aware of myself and I was unsure of myself.
And so when you have somebody who's walking around with their own issues and their own self-esteem issues crashing into your own uncertainty, it's not going to be a good combo, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Naomi Titleman:
So I'd say the one thing I've noticed is low self-esteem is one of the common threads I've seen.
Which is why I think people really have to work hard if they aspire to be leaders, to be whole people.
There's nothing more dangerous than a powerful low self-esteem person.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Naomi Titleman:
You have to work on yourself and feeling fulfilled if you want to be a leader.
Because you're governing people's lives.
So the ones that I feel like didn't serve me as well or others was people who I felt like had low self-esteem.
Really, you know, felt much better when they pointed out all your failings, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Naomi Titleman:
I felt much better.
Never really, you know, had this philosophy of like, I can't compliment too much because that will make their heads bigger or they may leave us, right?
Because they're so big.
Like keeping somebody's wings tight and clipped is what's going to keep people in your company, right?
If people are going to fly away from you, they're going to fly away from you.
And I think, you know, the reality is if they do it thinking that you've added to their life, that you've just amplified your influence in the world.
Right.
So, you know, I remember, you know, when I've had those situations where I would deliberately think to myself, how do I make it so that I am taking this poison ingesting it, but not passing it down?
And that is when sort of like the old African adage of turning poison into medicine became an art form for me.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
I've never heard that before.
So this idea, so tell us a little bit more about this adage and this concept.

Naomi Titleman:
Yeah.
So, you know, like I would have a situation, like I had one boss who was just, who would just scream at people all the time.
I'm sure he had his own issues, right?
Or another one who only took credit for himself, never was generous about how he spread compliments.
And, you know, I'd have one of those situations, or was okay putting his team at risk, but distanced himself from, you know, either business risk or other things, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Naomi Titleman:
And I used to think that, you know, okay, so I would leave the meeting and I would say, okay, take a breath.
That's when I started adopting things like meditation.
And again, like, if you don't want to be a person that rolls hurt from you to somebody else, you have to figure out how to break that cycle, right?
So I would meditate, I would do something, and then I would go into a meeting with my team and I would be a completely different person.
And I would, you know, it was a tough thing where you did a great job.
We're going to do this.
These are the learnings.
And again, like practicing what I wish somebody else was doing for me clumsily at that age, obviously, right?
As we're forming, but really making sure that like I detoxed before I went into a meeting with them.
I never did it, you know, perfectly all the time because we're all human.

Christine Laperriere:
Sure.

Naomi Titleman:
And I, you know, I also learned the site, sort of the art of like short circuiting my mistakes.
So if I spoke to somebody harshly or if I did something very quickly after that saying, you know, I'm sorry, I didn't, that was not done well, you know?
Just quickly, like not letting people's mental, sort of like what I call thought bubbles fester.
Yes.
And so, you know, I learned those things.
I practiced those things.
This is what I mean about like turning poison into medicine.
And it's sort of like, I think that, that sort of rigor helped me because, you know, when you become a leader, that's exactly what happens.
Your inbox is full of horrible, difficult to solve things, but you have to turn around and be authentically inspirational.
Not just with your words, but with your energy and your spirit.
And so, you know, you have to learn how to turn poison into medicine if you want to be an effective leader.

Naomi Titleman:
Right.
I think that's amazing.
So it's interesting because my last question for you, and you might have answered it, but I'm going to ask you anyway.
If you had to teach or advise future leaders who are listening to this show right now, and they're trying to be best bosses in their own right, what tips would you give them?
What would you tell them to focus on?
You know, give them some words of wisdom as they are kind of walking back into their day, trying to live some of these new principles.

Naomi Titleman:
So I think there are two buckets.
One is hardcore techniques, right?
So definitely be an avid reader of like management sort of techniques, behavioral science, all the things that sort of technically help you, right?
It's already been written in the books.
So there's no point in, there's nobody gets like originality scores in this.
You're either a good reader or you're not, right?
So the one thing I'd say is like go read the books.
Listen to the podcasts like yours and everybody else, right?
But the second thing I'd tell you is all of that is useless.
In fact, I know a lot of people that know how to say all of those things, but behind the curtain are not, right?
All of that is useless unless you work on yourself.
You know how they say like leadership doesn't make people, it just reveals them, right?
You have to decide what kind of human being are you going to be when you arrive because you will be revealed, whoever you are.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it.
That is a perfect ending to this amazing conversation.
Thank you so much.
I really, really appreciate it, Lule.
And if people want to find you, check out eToro and find you on LinkedIn.

Naomi Titleman:
eToro.com and check us out.
It's a fantastic community of investors.
In terms of myself, I can either be found on LinkedIn or X now, I guess, not Twitter.

Christine Laperriere:
Gotcha.
Excellent.
Well, thank you again.
I really appreciate you coming on the show.

Naomi Titleman:
Of course.
Good luck and nice to meet you.

Title: 
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Marianne Haegeli

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I have a special guest, Marianne Haegeli, who is actually calling from Zurich, Switzerland right now, which we're so excited to have you.
We met through a mutual connection, so I just love the fact that this idea inspired you and that you agreed to sign up to talk to me on the show.
Thank you, Marianne.

Marianne Haegeli:
Well, thank you, Christine, for having me.
I'm very excited to be here.
It actually feeds in really well that I'm calling from Zurich today.
We have a new pilot project going at our parent company called Work From Anywhere for one week out of the year, which I think is a brilliant leadership project to implement.
I'm taking full advantage because I also provided training to all employees on how you can make this a success.
Of course, I had to test it out, obviously.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's perfect.
That is perfect.
You're getting a chance to enjoy your life outside of work this week.
Probably see some exciting sights.

Marianne Haegeli:
Yeah, well, it's family that I have here, and so I had to manage everybody's expectations because of the six hour time difference where I am right now.
It's eight o'clock at night, so I get to spend the mornings having coffee and do fun stuff with my friends and my family.
And then at two p.m., it's nothing but work.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
That sounds amazing.
And I think a lot of people out there would love that type of flexibility.
So and tell us really quick, just a little bit about you, just so that everybody listening gets a little bit of context.

Marianne Haegeli:
Yes, I am currently the director for learning and leadership at a very small startup called Ensight, N-S-I-T-E.
And we are an enterprise of the national industries for the blind.
And so I'm going to introduce myself the way I would with any of our audience members when we do training.
I'm a 61 year old white woman.
I wear glasses, have very short hair.
I like to tend it salt and pepper, but I think it's trending heavily to just salt right now.
So that gives you an idea that I've been in the field of learning and development for longer than I care to admit.
And I've worked for nonprofits, for for-profits, for the U.S.
government, for private schools, for institutions of higher education, and loved every bit of it.
And what I'm doing for Ensight right now is building really, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say it's the first ever comprehensive employment readiness and career skills training from blind and visually impaired folks.
And then we help them get gainfully employed.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I'm doing an applause, a silent applause, because I don't, but you know what, I love to hear that.
That sounds like you're adding big value to some people's lives out there.

Marianne Haegeli:
I really feel that way.
I mean, a lot of people out there do similar things that we do.
And I have to tell you, there's never a day where I wonder why I get up in the morning.
I am loving this job and getting into this kind of engagement at my stage in my career is just unbelievable.
I feel so fortunate.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
So I'm going to dive right into our big question.
Who, if you have one or I'll leave the question open to you, but who is your best boss ever?

Marianne Haegeli:
I have three best bosses ever.
Lucky.
Yeah, I've been very fortunate.
So it's kind of what makes them the best boss ever at that time in my career, kind of defines how my career progressed.
The first best boss ever was when I started working for a large consulting firm, government consulting around the area.
And he was just amazing because he, within minutes, figured out what made me tick and never stopped asking what made me tick and responded to that by being the best possible manager I could ever have.
He gave me enough leeway to get creative, innovate.
He asked for my opinion, but he was always there if I needed him.
So he provided me the brilliant consulting apprenticeship.
And I'll tell you a story that really formed the way I view my role or have viewed my role ever since.
My very first engagement with that company was a huge transformation project with the Department of Homeland Security.
Project meeting, government leads there, and our project manager, who was not my best boss ever, but I equate the two because they have the same attitude, were in this meeting.
And I'm sitting there thinking, okay, this is going to be one of these dull kickoff meetings for a major project.
And this colleague of mine said to the government project manager, the following words, we're glad to be back.
You've had us back three years in a row.
Every time we gave you our services, we made our recommendations and you didn't implement and you didn't transform.
I'm here to tell you that this is the last time that in good conscience, we can take your money.
So if you again, don't implement our recommendations, we will not bid on the next contract.
And I almost fell off my chair and I thought this is what you want in an ethical consultant.
And that was the attitude of the whole organization and my best boss ever at that time personified all of that.
So to me, that was a key.
I love the integrity that stands behind that, right?
Yeah.
And it's usually not the reputation of government consultants, right?
They're viewed as slimy and somewhat, you know, cutting corners, but this was very much a no surprises approach in every single one of our projects.
You will not hide stuff from the client ever.
And amongst ourselves, we live that as well.
So that whole transparency and building of trust was just utterly amazing.
So that was very formative for me.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
I love that example too, because it just sends the message, right?
You're leading with integrity and transparency and you're not, we're going to hit the nail on the head with that.
Amazing.
So then you had two more, so keep going.

Marianne Haegeli:
Yeah.
So the second one was an amazing leader in terms of innovation and taking my expertise seriously, which is not always the case, especially at that time, I was a young woman working for a somewhat older director level manager.
And I had done some work for the state department, some really innovative stuff, and they hired me as the trusted advisor for the state department because we were implementing worldwide new visa information systems.
Crazy stuff.
It was a no cost to the government contract to the tune of about a hundred million.
Now I had to learn the for-profit world.
I came from being a government consultant and now I'm in the for-profit world where I have to figure out business cases that I have to sell to the C-suite and it's no cost to the government.
So even a bigger company than the other one I just described, this company went at risk to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, taking it in one little applicant fee at a time.
So it was a huge risk for the company, but this director gave me the best apprenticeship ever in terms of thinking through the process of a really complex operation in a foreign country where you had to consider local laws, you had to consider currency exchange rates, cultural considerations about how to do business in a contact center in El Salvador.
It was amazing.
And the way he taught was to sit down and say, okay, let's figure out Polish pricing.
And we'd literally have the proverbial napkin in a beer garden in Germany.
And we'd map out every step that we could think of that we needed to come up with pricing that will work.
It was fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
So it sounds like not only was he extremely thoughtful about your expertise and taking it seriously, it also sounds like he was really able to think about the customer and the process and the experience right through the end user, if you call it.
I'm hearing that it wasn't, like you said, local laws and currency.
And what is that person experiencing when they're interacting with this?

Marianne Haegeli:
Yeah, exactly.
It went from not just the client, but also the end user.
What tiny little pieces need to go into this?
And it was literally, you felt like an eagle at that table, even though my experience was nothing close to what he was bringing to the table.
But he never gave me the feeling that I was ignorant or just didn't understand.
We were sitting there and he would say, okay, now we need to factor this in and then there's probably going to be value added tax that we need to factor in.
Or maybe that's not a thing in this country.
And can we take the call that the call will originate in Germany?
Can we answer it in Turkey?
And then we would explore together how we can find a solution.
And always with both the end user, the visa applicant in mind, and the client at the government side, the consular officers, how do we make their lives easier?

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Marianne Haegeli:
But it was this feeling I got that I wasn't equal.
I had expertise on the visa side, he had expertise on the business case side, and together we were working to find a solution.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
That's amazing.
And it was truly, you know, for you, that feeling of being valued at the table probably brought more creativity and more ideas.

Marianne Haegeli:
Yeah, the confidence after a while, right?
You'd still go and check back, obviously, with everything.
But it was just amazing to see how something could come out of very little knowledge on my part with the right mentoring and support from somebody with all the experience that I didn't have.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So he valued the way you think, but maybe not the depth of experience necessarily.

Marianne Haegeli:
Exactly.
But he knew he had a vested interest in getting me to that experience level, because within a year, year and a half, all he needed from me, I submitted stuff for approval, and he knew it was going to be there.
And he had trained me the best way I could have ever been trained.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
So I'm just making notes because these are such great ideas.
Third boss.

Marianne Haegeli:
The third boss is my current boss.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.

Marianne Haegeli:
Totally new thing.
I really felt now I'm coming to this with a lot of experience.
I almost didn't apply for the job because I thought they're looking for somebody with experience dealing with blind and visually impaired folks.
And even though I've had some, I have some friends with issues like that.
I had a former business partner, but I felt I didn't know enough to apply for this job.
And then I did anyway, because it just sounded too cool to be true startup environment.
And at my age, who wouldn't want to get involved in a startup?
So startup, innovation, all of this.
So we have this first interview and I said to him, I got to ask you a question, because I've seen this in other nonprofits before, right?
And so it is a nonprofit and you say you want innovation and you say you want entrepreneurial spirit.
And I need to find out whether that's really true, because I've seen that in other places where they say they want it.
And then you come with crazy ideas and they say, ah, you know what?
We've always done it this way.
Let's just stick to that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Stop getting out of the box.
Let's put you back in the box.

Marianne Haegeli:
And he was, his answer was brilliant.
He said, listen, this has never been done before.
We need to not just think outside the box.
We need to work from way beyond the box to make this a success.
It's going to be a wild ride.
I'm telling you, we have the support of an amazing parent company, which is more than most startups have.
And I am telling you now the reason I want you in this role is because of your crazy background with other weird projects that came out of nowhere.
And the other thing I think really appealed to him was my intercultural background.
If you haven't noticed that, I'm not just calling from Zurich, but that cute accent I have is Swiss.
So I've lived in the States almost 40 years.
I've lived in Pakistan for two years and in Germany for two years, and I've traveled all over the world.
And to me, intercultural competency and intercultural understanding is what I believe makes me a better leader because every time I open my mouth, I'm trying to figure out how do I need to say this in this environment so that it arrives in an intelligible way with my audience, whoever that may be.
And I think my current best boss ever gets that because he's also well traveled and dealt with a lot of different cultures.
So it's just been amazing.
And with him, I get even more trust.
We will sit down and he will say, this is a challenge.
What do you think we should do?
And that is such an honor for me.
And it forces me to think very carefully because sometimes my crazy ideas come out a little too fast.
But then we can sit down together and figure it out.
And yes, I have not been disappointed.
He wants outside the box.
Yes, he wants and encourages innovation.
And also, like my first best boss ever is there to support me when I need it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So give us some examples of that.
Tell us even more.
What does that look like?
You know, if I was following you around around the world and getting a chance to see all of this in action, what things would I notice?

Marianne Haegeli:
So let me put it in maybe a better known leadership model.
I've worked a lot.
I've done a lot of leadership development training and I'm relying a lot on Blanchard and their concept of a situational approach to leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Marianne Haegeli:
So their argument is that as an effective leader, you need to match your leadership style, not only to the individual, but also to the task at hand, because that individual at this task may need more guidance than on another task.
And the example we have, we migrated at one of my former employers from a regular phone system to voiceover IP.
We had an amazing communications director, strategic communications.
That guy was a wizard.
We worked this transition and all of a sudden he was lost.
He said, I don't know how to do this.
I have to use my computer to make a phone call.
What is this?
This was pre-pandemic for everybody learned.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Marianne Haegeli:
So while he was the consummate expert in all things strategic communications, he was an absolute beginner on how to use this new technology.
So micromanagement and hands-on guidance was required until he became more comfortable and then you can let go a little more.
And so it became a six month training experience where, you know, he was able to get more proficient and I was able to step back a little every month and things worked out really well.
But for that to be successful, I had to understand that he was from a different generation, that he was used to picking up a phone and having that receiver in hand.
And I had to figure out how to take the fear of the technology out of him and show him that it's absolutely the same thing.
Instead of picking up the receiver, you click on that phone icon.
So you have to just think about, you know, how he's very insecure in this situation when normally he's the consummate expert.
That's a scary place to be.
So you can't walk in and say, well, it's really simple.
Here's five steps.
Just follow the list.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
You needed the handholding and support to help build the new habit and build the new skills.
And then you, as you coach him through that, you can slowly start to move away from that again.

Marianne Haegeli:
Yeah.
And so to me, that's, that's what leadership should be all about.
Leadership we all know is not about the leader.
It's about everybody else, right?
When you move to a different culture, it's incumbent upon you to figure out how that culture functions and how to communicate effectively within that culture.
And that's the same with leadership.
I don't talk to all of my colleagues the same way.
I adjust and not just to that colleague, but on the task we're talking about and possibly on the time of day or how they're feeling on that given day.
And I have to tell you, for me, one of the reasons why this is an absolute dream job right now is because not only is it yet another apprenticeship, but it's a cross-cultural adventure.
I am now we have two colleagues on the team who are completely blind and one who is visually impaired.
And it's a daily challenge for me to make sure that everything I produce is accessible to them.
I spend an ordinary amount of time sitting with them and saying, okay, tell me what you see as you're using your screen reader.
Is my PowerPoint presentation accessible to you?
Where could I do better?
And I have learned so much in the last year and a half.
It's utterly amazing.
And the learning continues.
So I'm learning a new language.
I'm learning a new culture, and I get to innovate.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, it's the trifecta.
Amazing.
That is so great.
Well, listen, I love that.
And I love the stories of those three bosses that you shared.
So just bringing this back to, and I want you to think about this, given all the different experience you have, what is the business case?
What's the impact to the bottom line if an organization has a best boss ever versus not?

Marianne Haegeli:
It's huge.
I think if you have a best boss ever, and again, I'm a little biased.
I mean, it is intercultural stuff, right?
But if that best boss can use those cultural competencies, those intercultural competencies to figure out how to talk to each person the way they need to hear whatever the message is, whether it's a difficult conversation or a motivational speech or saying, here's the bottom line.
Let's go get it, whatever it is.
If they're capable of doing that, then the business will take care of itself.
You don't have to apply excessive guidance.
You can really just motivate people to be the best at what they are.
I think the other thing that's really important about a best boss is that they build a team based on how the team fits together, keeping in mind the end goal.
Sometimes it's not the person with the very best skill and years of experience.
Sometimes it's the person who's the best fit culturally.
You can always add skills, but fit is difficult sometimes.
I think it's absolutely key to success to have a best boss.

Christine Laperriere:
When you think of leaders that you've worked with who they don't ring the bell of your favorite, and maybe they limited or stifled your creativity or some of what you bring to the table, tell us a little bit about what are the traits of that kind of leader?
What do we want to watch out for?

Marianne Haegeli:
Yeah, I have a beautiful example of that, too.
I had a leader who got hired in after I was there for a while, and the first thing they told me when they walked in was, I don't really know anything about what you do in learning and development.
That's going to be your thing.
Move on.
Admitting that they know nothing about what I do is not the problem.
The problem came when within two or three months, they didn't seem to believe in my expertise.
Well, if you're not the expert, but I was hired because I'm supposed to be the expert, and you will not only not ask for my opinion before you make decisions, but you will certainly never take my suggestions and stifle my innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, that is absolutely moralizing.
And again, I don't expect a leader to know everything.
On the contrary, I think an effective leader hires people who are completely unlike them and compliment their strengths and build it in that way.
I don't want to have 15 mini-me's running around.
That's not going to go anywhere.
I need somebody who is not Marianne.
There's stuff I know I'm not very good at.
Those are the people I want to hire who have those skills that I'm missing.
So that was a problem for me.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and it's so interesting because you just pointed out something like, so the person just didn't include you or didn't invite your expertise to the table.
And so sometimes it's funny and we think of a not great leader as somebody who says something terrible or does something awful.
But the truth is, it's almost what they don't do.
It's the vacuum of what was missing.

Marianne Haegeli:
Well, you know, and part of the problem is invariably there be fallout and guess who gets to deal with that.
Those are the challenges.
Again, I have no issue with you being open about not having the expertise.
That's why you have me.
But then just ignoring the fact that you have that expertise on your team, that's the problem.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And so just to kind of pull this together, there are some amazing leaders out there listening to this right now, trying to sharpen their skills to be best bosses.
If you had to give them any tips, tricks, practices, things that you really want them to take away from what you shared today, what would you advise them to do?

Marianne Haegeli:
Do anything you can to become aware of what's going on with your team members.
Right.
I mean, it's that active listening, that genuine interest and what makes them take and what's happening with them today in this moment.
I know we get buried in work and we forget to listen and because we don't have time or whatever.
I have a rule where I tell my team members, I know I get frazzled sometimes, but if you need my undivided attention, tell me I need you for two minutes in the conference room and you will have my undivided attention.
I'll drop anything and you'll have my undivided attention because if I stop paying attention to what it is you need, I am not doing my job.
So it's that cross-cultural understanding.
It makes you vulnerable, which is actually a good thing because you can admit that sometimes things are too much for you too.
Right.
Yep.
But if you make an effort to understand them, I guarantee you they'll make an effort to understand you and it will be, the sky is going to be the limit in terms of meeting your business goals.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Well, listen, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom with us.
I definitely will say wisdom because I got lots of amazing nuggets and I'm sitting here smiling at all these great ideas that you just filled my head with.
So thank you, Mary Ann, so much.

Marianne Haegeli:
Thank you, Christine.
It's been an absolute pleasure.

Episode: 63
Title: 
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jessica Schultchen

Christine Laperriere:
And today I have Jessica Schultchen on.
Jessica, can you please share your name and say it perfectly for me?
And then just tell everybody a little bit about you.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, absolutely.
Thanks, Christine.
My name is Jessica Schultchen.
I am the Director of Strategic Operations with the Government of Alberta.
And I, in a previous life, was a classroom teacher in the K-12 public education system here in Alberta before transitioning over to be a public servant of the government.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
And thank you.
So it's so neat.
We met through LinkedIn and it sounds like this discussion around best boss ever and the podcast that I've been running has inspired you to think about a leader that pretty near and dear to your heart.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, absolutely.
I am definitely a big fangirl and love the podcast, love all the products you make for LinkedIn and so on.
So I've been using your podcast in, you know, professional development, professional learning settings for a couple of years.
And I always thought about, you know, who would be my best boss ever.
And it's kind of taken me a year or so to think about it because I've had many great ones, but there is someone special that I think kind of hits it even on a different level.

Christine Laperriere:
All right.
Well, definitely.
Please tell us a little bit about your best boss ever.

Jessica Schultchen:
So the best boss I think that I've ever had is Brock Higginson.
And Brock Higginson was my principal when I was a classroom teacher in a past life.
Usually when you think of a principal in a school, historically, especially across Canada, that usually used to be kind of like the best teacher in the building, right?
It was kind of the master teacher.
It was the person that everybody wanted to be in their class and also the person who had the best results with student learning.
And usually it was a very experienced person, very more towards the end of their career and really a subject matter expert.
So we're really, really knowledgeable about a subject area.
And Brock kind of broke all those rules in a super inspiring way.
So Brock became a principal after only two years of teaching, which is kind of unheard of.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
That's pretty quick.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.
And so his career kind of began in a rural school authority in the province that, you know, there was a need for a principal and he kind of stepped up and modeled that kind of safe risk taking and service really is a great servant leader and he is somebody who, you know, always really just wants to make a positive impact on other people.
And so Brock ended up becoming my principal for two years when I was teaching in an elementary school.
And he really just, like I said, exemplified that servant leadership, but also the idea of lifelong learning.
And always being able to create an environment for staff and students that was conducive to learning and growth for adults and for kids.
And in the field of education, there is a study of management, but it's a classroom management study.
Most teachers and educators really think about, you know, how to build safe and caring schools and how to build environments where kids can perform their best.
And Brock was the best leader, I believe, and understanding that that exact same philosophy actually has to be applied to your staff as adults.
So he treated us the way we wanted to treat the kids.
And that was a whole other level of servant leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
So give me some examples.
This is a fascinating idea.
Share with us, you know, kind of what is it like to work with somebody?
Like what are, what are the meetings like?
What are the conversations like?
You know, tell me more.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.
So I guess what I would first start with is the context of my first impression of Brock as a leader.
And it's actually something he didn't do to me.
It's something he did to another staff member.
So when Brock first came in over the summer, he was just trying to build some relationships, you know, get to know his staff before the kids come in for the school year.
And Brock walked around and found a first year teacher prepping in their classroom, which is very typical.
And in elementary school, laminating is kind of the bane of your existence.
Okay.
So you laminate and plastify everything because kids spill everything and you use these labels all year, but it is a good investment in your time.
Okay.
So Brock finds this first year teacher with a huge role of laminating.
And he says to him, Hey, what are you doing?
And he says, Oh, I'm just cutting out some laminate and getting ready for his first day school.
You know, and Brock says, do you want me to do it for you?
And I've never to this day ever heard another leader be so willing to take off manual administrative tasks off the plate of their staff, you know, like he truly recognized in that moment that he had the capacity to cut that out for him and to support that first year teacher would give him so much more mental freedom.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
It sounds like a tedious, miserable process that like you said is worthwhile, but it sounds kind of like a miserable part of the job.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.
And it's something that so many principals or leaders would say, you know, that's below my pay grade.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Jessica Schultchen:
Right.
I don't cut stuff out anymore.
And it's that idea of like being willing to see the organization from the perspective of your staff and see that from his perspective as a first year teacher, that individual actually his whole life was consumed with basic, how am I going to make my classroom function?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Jessica Schultchen:
It'd be a safe place for the kids to arrive.
Whereas maybe Brock in his lens is thinking about what does your teaching strategy look like or your method, but Brock is an excellent leader at differentiating too for his staff and recognizing that different staff are in different places in their growth and their learning that you as a leader adapt to them to push them for growth no matter where they are.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So he understood how to align the way he worked and customize it for each staff member that he was working with.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.
And cause in this context, he's actually an English speaking only principal, but he's leading a team of half French, half English staff and classes in this building.
It's just a perfect example of how you might not be able to speak the language all the time or belong to something in the full way, but that interpersonal relationship is your gateway.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So he would learn how to do that even if he didn't have the language skill.
Amazing.
And so did you have staff meetings?
Did you have times where he had to pull all of you together?

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, absolutely.
So he was really instrumental in bringing us back to basics and bringing us back to like, what are our values and what are we trying to achieve?
So in regards to the way we functioned as teachers and as teams, he would ask us, you know, to reflect on, do you have the things that are going to set your kids up for success?
So, you know, do you have ongoing assessment?
Do you have routines?
Do you have relationships?
And then can those three things actually be adapted for each individual in your classroom?
And so he would kind of model this process of what it would look like with a student with his staff.
So one really neat thing he did was that he had this internal grant program.
So in a school, money is tight.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, yeah, right.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.
And instead of just allocating individual budgets or making everything go through him and a first come first serve basis, he created this grant program where an individual teacher could come up with a business case, like an idea of something they need and why it would improve their performance and their students' performance.
And then you could request up to $2,000 for that.
So, for example, one staff member had students who would really benefit from like standing bike stations where the desk is attached to a bike.

Christine Laperriere:
So very cool.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, very cool.
And so for me, I made a case that I would like to make an activity where I could bring students from different school authorities to one building and have like a community day.
And so we use that money to pay for their busing.
And that's something that the other school authorities at that time didn't have in their budget.
So we paid the bill because in the long run, it was the best thing for us building relationships as professionals, best thing for the students to see other people to which they belong.
And it was also a great growth opportunity for us because we saw how other teachers worked.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
That's the grant idea is fantastic.
And it, it sounds like a great opportunity to give teachers a little bit of autonomy, right?
To, because you're, like you said, budget's very tough and it sounds like sometimes it's not the easiest type of a job to have freedom to think outside the box, right?
Because it's like, there's not money for that.
There's not money for that.
Right.
So it's just such a cool way to encourage some creative thinking, like, which is so much of what energizes a lot of us is to want to be able to execute on those cool ideas that sit outside of our day job.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.
And I think that was the thing is that Brock was able to still like spark enthusiasm despite difficult situations.
And he was able to build collegiality and that internal network of support.
Because again, he was just modeling it.
He was just showing up in your classroom and offering to help.
He was showing colleagues how to support each other better too.

Christine Laperriere:
It's amazing.
So definitely one of those that his actions spoke louder than words is really what I'm hearing in some of those examples.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, absolutely.
And at the same time, you know, like work wasn't just all of who Brock is.
Brock continued to somehow be a realtor.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh my gosh.

Jessica Schultchen:
Continued to be a 40 under 40 with the Chambers of Commerce.
And he continued to like mentor and coach at sports teams and volunteer for all, you know, run these music concerts in the summer on his time off.
And he was just kind of one of these, you know, he's one of these people who can really inspire that abundance mindset too, that it's actually not that like we're all burning out.
It's that we're not maybe always using our energy in the right places.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And he, he knows how to do the things that energize him and light him up so that he could really stay fueled off of that.

Jessica Schultchen:
And he would encourage us, you know, to be our whole selves and to not, this was never like a leader who would expect you to work, you know, all the time or anything like that.
He is definitely a leader who valued again, like if you expect the students to not be able to go home and do homework all night, why would I expect my staff to do that?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
We want you to work hard, but we want you to have a life and re-energize and come back fresh, right?

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.
Amazing.
Amazing.
I just love this story.
This is amazing.
Anything else that you want to share about him before I ask you some more questions?

Jessica Schultchen:
I think just that there was one time where after working with him for a couple of years, you know, I really loved working with him.
I really found him to be like an excellent leader.
And I truly believe like in every ounce of him, he believed in me and my potential.
And I remember going to him one day and saying, I saw this other posting and I like, it is what I need.
It's the right growth, but you're the right leader.
What do I do?
And I remember Brock saying to me, you should never say no to the opportunity to help someone.
And that has resonated with me so deeply.
And that was a lot of why I think I had the confidence to leave a classroom and move to public service and think, well, like, you know, how can I, how can I help people?
And if I have the opportunity, I should take it and I should be courageous and I should channel my inner Brock and I should, you know, be the second year principal because who cares what anyone thinks if your goal is to serve and make people's lives better.
If your intention is true, just go for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
What an amazing, I mean, and that sounds like, you know, the gift, like that's, it's like great bosses.
They kind of leave a stamp on you, right?
They make you think about how you're going to lead because you always want to, you want to give other people that same experience.
Right.
And so just him being so focused on never say no to an opportunity to help others and it doesn't, my ego is absolutely second, third, fourth on the list of things that are in concern when you have an opportunity to help others.
Right.
And so I just think that's such a cool legacy or mark, you know, that he's made on you.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, absolutely.
And it's something that like I have shared with every person I've ever mentored, every student teacher, every public servant that I have mentored and it's something that ultimately, you know, I have heard other leaders say in different ways, in different, you know, we do the best we can with what we have and those kinds of things, but there's something about the idea of it being so service oriented.
Right.
That is kind of on a different level than just being like a visionary leader, but really, truly being a servant leader that you want to make the world a better place and it's really not about you.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And I have to say, I mean, teachers and principals, like the mark that they make, I mean, I even have memories of my principal when I was in second grade, you know what I mean?
And just like the mark that, you know, just the positive energy and the mark, I mean, I should do a show on him at some point.
My memories are probably faded, but just that, you know, the impact, right?
And so there are going to be children who grow into adults and remember, you know, the teachers and the principals of their schools and how they were taught to show up in the world and maybe at home, they didn't see it, but they got a chance to see it at school.
So it's a pretty amazing mark that all of you get to leave on others.

Jessica Schultchen:
And yeah, and like that just reminds me, you know, one thing that Brock did too, that was very unique.
I've never seen anyone else do this.
So he stands outside the school every day and waves and greets every single student and parent who comes.
Every single student and parent, 600 kids in that school.
And he stands there, rain and shine in Canada.
Canada.

Christine Laperriere:
For the listeners out here who don't know where you're actually calling from, that is a huge testament to his commitment right there in the blizzards and in the, in the wind.

Jessica Schultchen:
And I just remember that, you know, like the kids, the kids and the parents look forward to it every day.
And they modeled that friendliness and safe and caring environment again that he expected from his staff.
You should stand at your door and greet your kids because I stand at the school and greet the kids.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.
Wow.
As a parent of a five and a seven year old, I just can picture how there is nothing more powerful than knowing that your children are in a great place for learning.
So that's gotta leave again, just a different mark on those people who walk out the door and have to go focus on their jobs and just know that, you know, you guys cared enough to greet everybody.
That tells us a lot about what's happening when we walk away.
Right.

Jessica Schultchen:
And I think those things get really overlooked when we think about adults, because we start to think, well, you know, does my staff need me to do a walkabout?
Well, yeah, actually they do.
They do.
They do need you to pop into their office and say, how was your weekend and how are you feeling today?
And that's not actually an extra.
It's not a nice to have.
It's actually foundational to creating psychological safety for your staff, just like it would be the same thing for a child.
And we have to just send them back up and be like, we're kind of all just a little kids in big bodies.
And we still all want to feel safe and cared for.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
I think that is a amazing point that you're bringing up.
So one of the questions I always like to ask everybody is the impact to the bottom line.
And I know in education and government and different, you know, the bottom line looks different sometimes the way that it shows up.
But I mean, what is Brock's leadership?
Like, what is that impact that he makes, quote unquote, to the bottom line of that school?
How would you describe that?

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, definitely.
I think that the two things that you do when you increase the bottom line as an educational leader is you and what Brock has done is he increases the capacity of his staff by recognizing emerging leaders and building and investing in them.
And then he uses those great leaders on his staff to build the capacity with some of the more reluctant staff, which is a great strategy.
And then he uses that to ultimately increase his bottom line, which is student learning.
He increases the what, how much and to what level of mastery students are learning in that building.
Because he's increasing the capacity of all of the teachers and research makes it really clear.
It's the teacher and then the principal that impacts student learning.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Amazing.
I love that because again, it's, you can see the impact, you know, this is, this is measurable.
I can imagine how much more he's getting out of people.
Like you said, that increased capacity.
You could hear that in the stories and examples you gave.
So that makes a lot of sense to me.
And when you think of, let's say, leaders that you've worked with when it wasn't as easy or as great, like what are some of the traits that, that you, you find don't work well for you in a leader?

Jessica Schultchen:
I think that like the best advice for all humans at any age.
I once, when I was a student teacher, I remember once a principal saying, you'll notice that all great teachers have routines.
And I think that is the biggest thing.
Process is what creates stress, right?
Lack of process and clarity and roles and expectations or how the flow of work is going to be achieved is ultimately what creates like anxiety and stress.
People don't know what they're trying to achieve or how to get there.
And so they're just kind of spinning their tires and that creates worry.
And I think that having those routines, but also having this ongoing assessment of like, okay, but just because we have a routine, doesn't mean it has to exist forever.
Like it is in fact necessary to continually revise those processes and be open to change and learning something new.

Christine Laperriere:
And that sounds like exactly what all of us can take away, right?
So even today, would you say you have a routine inside of your own, you know, kind of, you're in a completely different environment now, but you still create that.

Jessica Schultchen:
Yeah, exactly.
And like there were kind of, you know, when I first came to government, I had these two co-managers who also had come from the education sector before, but had been in government for quite a long time.
And I think that those two co-managers were sort of like my indication that what Brock did in a school could be applied in any situation and any organization.
So they, maybe we weren't calling it routines, but we were calling it process.
Maybe we weren't calling it safe and caring schools.
We were calling it psychological safety, but it was the same thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Amazing.
This has been so good.
I love it.
So as people are out there and they're listening and they have one or two like nuggets that they're going to take away from this conversation, I hear routines as, you know, great.
I also hear kind of the way that Brock has demonstrated this amazing leadership toward you.
What tip would you give a leader that's listening to this today and wants to be a little bit more of a best boss ever?

Jessica Schultchen:
I think to see your role as a teacher instead of a supervisor.
So to recognize that actually all great leaders are just really great teachers.
They're people who set up environments for people to succeed and grow.
And so I think modeling humility, modeling that learning process is really important and modeling safe and measurable risk taking, and sometimes modeling failure.
I think that those are the hardest things to get adults to do and that children do very well.
And if we could kind of collectively fail together sometimes and reflect on that and, and welcome that learning opportunity without punishment, that would be the best thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
Oh, I just, I love your answer to that.
I have like, I'm grinning from ear to ear over here because I have so many thoughts, but I'm going to, I'm going to just let you shine.
So thank you so much for an awesome interview.
I really appreciate it.
And I'm so glad you took the time to sit down with me, Jessica.

Jessica Schultchen:
Thank you.
