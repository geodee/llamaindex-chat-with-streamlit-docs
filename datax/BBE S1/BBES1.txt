Title: Thrown in the deep end
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Samantha Speisman

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So welcome to the show, Sam.

Samantha Speisman:
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm so glad that you're here.

Samantha Speisman:
Me too. I'm so thrilled to be here. It's such a nice way to start a morning.

Christine Laperriere:
And before we dive in, why don't you just tell our listeners your title and who you are really quick.

Samantha Speisman:
Sure. So I'm Sam Speisman, Head of Content at Newsworthy and The Bullet. The Bullet is a daily news digest, comes out in the morning, really shares everything you need to know to start your day from hard news to the more lighthearted stuff. And then, Newsworthy is a white label publisher. So we create content for other brands.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. And before we get started, I think what's so neat about why I invited you on the show was that you helped me produce The Whipp, which is my newsletter, and you're brilliant. But when I was telling you about this passion project of wanting to start Best Boss Ever, you immediately lit up, your face lit up and you couldn't help it. You just started telling me about your best boss ever, and I was all grins ear to ear. The best part of the whole story is that after she got done telling me about her best boss ever, I had a hunch that I knew who she was talking about. And next thing you know, we realized that we both knew this leader and I actually could even identify her from that story, so I think this one has to be on the show. So with that, I mean, do tell us a little bit about who your best boss ever is.

Samantha Speisman:
Well, I think the reason why I was so excited about the concept is, for me, my best boss ever came very early in my career. So she had a huge impact on the steps that I took after that first foray into the corporate world. I mean, her name is Stephania Varalli. I'm just going to cut to the chase there. She now works, I think, as one of the owners of Women of Influence, Head of Media over there, I believe. We've run in the same circles for the last 15 years, but she was my first manager. She was the editorial director at sweetspot.ca, which was a small business, first digital women's magazine in Canada, and I started there as an intern.

Samantha Speisman:
So you can imagine the impact that someone at that level would have on someone who is just starting her career and how the lessons she taught me would impact me as I moved through. So as soon as you told me about this, I immediately knew I had to talk about Steph because, like I said, she's really had an impact on me over the last 13, it's either been 13 or 15 years that I've been working in industry, so it was a natural fit.

Christine Laperriere:
So give us some of the examples, like when I say that who's your best boss ever, I mean, your face just lights up. Obviously, there are some experiences that you had working for her that stood out right away.

Samantha Speisman:
Sure. I think that it was obviously a product of the culture. I still work with Joanna Track who founded Sweetspot, and I know a lot of that really came from Joanna's view on how business should be run, but so much of what Steph built with the editorial team specifically really centered around trust and building self-confidence. So as an intern, you come into a fully female team, and this is really hindsight because after Sweetspot, I left and worked at other places where this was not the case.

Samantha Speisman:
But Steph really fostered a environment of camaraderie. She always trusted her team members to take ownership over whether it was writing or events. So for example, when I was just starting, she would always encourage me to write things that I probably had no business writing because I was just starting, and she would often edit the crap out of them. But still, to me, that opportunity to really flex my writing skills, even when I was still starting and knowing that it would probably be more work for her, she was really committed to teaching and giving us those experiences to help our careers and help us grow.

Samantha Speisman:
And even other little things like going to press events which, after 13 years, I understand are one of the best perks of working in this industry. But she would often allow the interns and some of the more junior team members to go to these events and really trusted us to represent the brand from an early point where, as I've learned over the course of the last now 10 years, almost 10 years since Sweetspot shut down, is not the case at most places. And there's a different energy in many corporate environments where there's a lot of seniority and hierarchy. If you're more senior, then you get to go to these events, and if you're more junior, then you don't.

Samantha Speisman:
I think that trust that she instilled in the team and allowed us to build helped shape all of our self-confidences. And if you look at that team and where they are now, almost every single person is working in quite senior roles at various companies. I think it's really a testament to that initial trust that she showed to us and let us go off on our own probably earlier than we should have.

Samantha Speisman:
Yeah, I think that that was a huge part of it and really just the freedom and the inspiration that came with all of that and just the pleasant environment that I think that she also fostered, which I've taken forward and try to build both at my previous role, which was a big corporate company, and now working at a small business.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. And so, it sounds like she threw you in the deep end even when you were just an intern, just starting out, and then she gave you the latitude to take a swing at it on your own even if she had to do some heavy lifting to help get the quality of the work up to where it needed to be. She still put you out there and let you see what you were capable of.

Samantha Speisman:
Absolutely. And I think that that's something that I'm seeing now from her perspective in my current role, which is as you hire more junior team members and you want them to learn and grow and mentor and teach, it is more work to facilitate that journey and to help them grow. It's often easier to just do it yourself, but I think realizing now the efforts and the lengths she went to to really help those who are starting hone those skills again at a detriment to her. And she probably is where I get a lot of my work ethic because I know it took more work for her to run the team in this way. I would often get edits back from her 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM not expecting a response. I'm not suggesting that she really know-

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right.

Samantha Speisman:
... but just seeing that she was working additional hours. And I know that a lot of that came down to giving us the opportunity to learn and grow and taking the time to critique our work, send it back to us, and let us know really where we were going wrong. I think I'm definitely a better writer for it and certainly a better editor at this point. But yeah, it was definitely that work ethic and the trust that she showed in all of us, I think, that stuck with... And I speak to many of the people on her team regularly that really stuck with us over the years.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And did she ever get frustrated, though? I mean, because I know as you're building up a young team or a new team, you're teaching and reteaching and reteaching sometimes. And so, I'm just curious. I mean, how did she deal with that? I mean, did you see that?

Samantha Speisman:
I mean, I can't say for sure that it didn't happen. I certainly never felt it in a negative way. I've seen other leaders, obviously not Steph, but I've seen other leaders over my career who really let their frustration show and can often belittle and really come down hard on juniors. I never felt that way. I never saw it. If it happened, it happened behind closed doors, and I was [crosstalk 00:08:56] to it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. That's interesting. I mean, what I'm hearing if we were really summarizing the qualities that made this particular best boss ever, it was the willingness to throw you in the deep end and see what you could do, which fostered a self-confidence in you. It helped you build your skill really quickly, which is really impressive. But I'm also hearing an element of patience. And then, I think there's... Because what I'm really trying to do right now is dissect those qualities that make for that best boss ever because we talk about all these things in very general terms, and leadership training and leadership jargon. We talk about trust, and trust is there's a lot of elements to that. What does that actually look like? But when I'm hearing is that she trusted you to run with the ball. So there's an element of delegation here. There is an element of trust. There's an element of really helping you build up your skills to the top level that you could and also a level of patience. So I think that is a pretty powerful combination when you think of what your best boss ever actually looks like.

Christine Laperriere:
Can I ask you a question about your, let's call it your worst boss ever or an experience? This isn't about trash talking, although it's always fun to trash talk a little bit, but it's not so much about trash talk. What is the thing that you remember so specifically that really didn't work for you where you're like, "I would not work for that person or a person with that quality again"?

Samantha Speisman:
So I think the number one quality that has turned me off consistently over the last however many years is insecurity. It's become such a pervasive quality in maybe my industry because there's so many changes in publishing. And for as long as I've worked in digital media, it's always been seen as the cousin or the nasty family member that nobody really wants to acknowledge because they're going to throw a wrench in the dinner or the party or whatever, because when I worked in digital media at the very beginning of my career as an intern, it was coming for print. Print was always worried about digital. And then, my second long-term career was in broadcasting. And so, same idea. Digital media was coming for broadcast and for television, and people were cutting cable and all these things.

Samantha Speisman:
So I've dealt with insecure bosses time and time again, and I think that that's one quality that I always try to... If I even feel it coming in, I recognize it and I push it away because it makes everything else so much more challenging. It fosters such a negative environment. And the people who work for you, they feel that insecurity. And it's okay to be worried about job security in this day and age. It happens all the time. But to manage from that point and to feel like you need to prove yourself because you're insecure about your future, your insecure about your role at the company, I think that's the most negative trait that I've witnessed, the most toxic trait that I've witnessed in the workplace. It really does trickle down into every decision and the way that your team feels.

Samantha Speisman:
And that really started with my worst boss ever because, like I said, it was worry about the future of their particular industry, their particular role, and having a digital media. I don't want to say expert, but someone who's worked in digital media for years who really understands that space felt like a threat.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.And the minute they feel threatened by their own team, you're now sparring against one another versus truly working together to get there fastest.

Samantha Speisman:
Absolutely. And you're not thinking about the company or brand or product that you're building. You're thinking about what is going to further my role, what's going to make me look better, how am I going to carve a space for myself in the future. And if you feel that your team's skillset or the priorities that your team is focused on don't align with your future and your role, then the decisions you make are not going to be for the benefit of your team or for the brand company product.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. I think you nailed it. I think insecurity is absolutely something that I noticed time and time again in my own experiences of working for different people. And even today coaching so many leaders, I think insecurity really clouds good decision-making, good people skills, good communication. Unfortunately, there's a lot of environments where I think of... I think your word of toxic is the right word because insecurity is catchy. If your boss is insecure, then all of a sudden you start to wonder why you're feeling so confident. So the interesting thing is is when you see insecurity happening somewhere in the top of the house, a lot of the time, it's catchy.

Samantha Speisman:
For sure. And I found that the more insecure my manager, the more they micromanaged, which is obviously a phrase and a trade that I don't think anybody enjoys in a work environment. But again, because there's that insecurity, it really becomes what can I do to again further my position, further my career, ensure that I have a future here. And by having a hand in anything that could be successful, that insecurity really comes through. In addition to making your team feel insecure, it takes away all the things that we just talked about as the best boss ever, which is that trust and freedom and room for growth because you're constantly having someone looking over your shoulder, making sure that they've put their stamp on whatever that project is. So that if it does prove to be successful, they can say that they were a part of it or it was their project.

Samantha Speisman:
One of the other things that I wanted to mention about Steph and why she really had such an impact on my career and one trait that I think is so important and that I continue to at least try to implement with my own team is she always gave her team credit for success. She wasn't ever someone to put up her hand and say, "That was my idea. I was involved in this." Obviously as a manager, she had a hand in anything that was successful. But even as an intern, if you had an idea or you had a story pitch and we went with it and it performed really well, she was the first person to say, "That was Sam's idea. She wrote it. It was wonderful." It didn't even matter if she had edited the whole thing and totally reworked it, and in the end it was like a fraction of what you had originally suggested. She always gave credit.

Samantha Speisman:
I think that that is one of the most important things you can do as a leader and as a best boss ever because it really gives you that confidence as a young employee to continue putting your ideas out there and continue taking risks because you know that if something works out, that you will be awarded or rewarded for it, which I think is really important.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it makes you want to work harder because you can't wait to get that recognition. It's literally the opposite of what insecurity does.

Samantha Speisman:
Totally.

Christine Laperriere:
So you can really see it again right there.

Samantha Speisman:
My experiences with my worst bosses ever, they would take credit for ideas or projects that perhaps weren't their idea. And I think that that's just such an example of the opposite ends of the spectrum and how one can can impact you positively and one can impact you so negatively.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And it's the difference between leadership and individual contribution. So if you're an individual contributor and you do great work and you want to promote your great work, that's fantastic. But when you move into a leadership position, you're responsible now for the work and the success of others and you're responsible for the culture and the mentality and the psychology of others. So, to me, that's exactly where the moment in time shifts where you no longer promote your own work. You promote the quality of the work that your team is delivering.

Samantha Speisman:
For sure. And I never understood the worst boss ever technique of taking credit because at the end of the day, if you're a leader and a manager and your team is successful, you are successful. A successful team reflects so positively on their leader. So the more success you can draw from your team members, the better you're going to look in the grand scheme. So although it's not selfish to give credit... In a way, it is kind of selfish because you're still going to come out looking like a rock star if your team's performing well, but your team's also going to feel like rock stars, which I think is the most important thing.

Christine Laperriere:
It's excellent. I really appreciate the angle or the lens that you're bringing to this because it just really hits the mark and so many situations that I can think of my own work experience, and just to be able to really show that difference between the way Stephania approached leadership and how that built you up versus that insecurity and that toxicity and how much that limited your growth. So I think, again, you can reflect back and see, "Wow, does that really make a difference?" It really stands out as night and day.

Samantha Speisman:
And I think the other thing that's really important to note is just how that experience with the worst boss ever, and there were a few, I won't say there was just one, there were a few, really shone a light on how Stephania was the best boss ever because that juxtaposition between that toxicity and that extreme trust showed me what kind of leader I wanted to be and how I could implement those lessons that she taught me at a very early stage of my career, and see how the toxicity with my worst bosses ever impacted me in such a negative way and make sure that moving forward as I built a team that I implemented all those lessons that she had taught me because I saw what an impact they could have long-term. I mean, it's been 13 years since I started working for her and I still remember how that job made me feel as a entry-level writer, publisher, editor, just the confidence and the freedom.

Samantha Speisman:
And the other thing, I think, that is important too, and I know work from home, we're all sick of it now because we've been doing it for however long, but Steph really bought into that idea long before it was trendy or it was widely accepted in the corporate world. She ensured that we took a day, a week to work from home. And really, again, it played into that idea of trust, but knowing that we were able to take that time and focus on our skills and not worry about meetings and commuting and all these things that often drain your creativity in a day so that we could really build on our skills. And as a result, I think that we all worked that much harder for the brand and her and the company and the results that she got out of us were so much stronger.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is amazing, right? So she has this green team and she's getting amazing results, and it's from this approach.

Samantha Speisman:
I didn't even, for the five years I worked there and granted I was green and new, but I never even considered working anywhere else because my happiness and my fulfillment in that role was so strong that I didn't even think about it. Every day was a joy. And I remember some of the more senior team members saying to me and some of my more junior colleagues, "This isn't normal. This doesn't happen all the time." But I think that that was really because of the environment that Stephania built and Joanna built, and really trying to create this place where we would all feel safe and could grow and could build that self-confidence that's so important for leaders in this age.

Christine Laperriere:
And just to bring that to close, my hope by shining a light on these best boss ever is that what if we said, "This is normal"? Imagine that. Imagine if you said, "Wow, I'm really happy and fulfilled and I don't want to go anywhere. I feel like I'm completely growing and I'm expanding." What if that was normal? And people said, "Oh, the insecure boss that you work for who's toxic, who's micromanaging you, that's not normal."

Christine Laperriere:
I think it's time for this paradigm shift. We're getting into flexible work which, by requirement, demands trust. And I mean, if you look, a lot of us are all saying like, "Put us into the gig economy," because at the end of the day, we want the freedom, right? We want that trust. We still want to grow. We still want to grow strong skills. We still want to work on high-performing teams. We still want to deliver results, but we're tired of being micromanaged and we're tired of the lack of trust and some of those things. So I just think it's a great way to close that. I want to encourage everybody to ask the question, when you are working for your best boss ever, what if everybody said, "Oh, and by the way, this is normal"?

Samantha Speisman:
I agree. I agree. I think that would be unbelievable. I try to foster with my team, and hopefully as they grow their careers, they'll go out and foster it with their own teams and we'll start a revolution.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. I love it. Thank you, Sam. That was fantastic to talk to you.

Samantha Speisman:
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you. And like I said, I hope everybody tunes in again so we can hear more about other people's best boss ever. Take care. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast

Title: Head, heart and guts
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Greg Hewitt

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So on today's show, I have Greg Hewitt coming on and I am so excited to have Greg here, because Greg and I worked together years ago. And I often reference Greg as being one of the best bosses ever that I've seen in action. So I personally, even though you weren't technically my boss, you were my top client. I got a chance to work for you and see what your inspired style of leadership did. I got to see the kind of culture you created, and I love to see how people love to follow you. And that was something that I really admired. So in honor of you being on my list of best bosses ever, I really wanted to invite you on the show and get a chance to ask you about your best bosses ever. So thank you, Greg.

Greg Hewitt:
Thanks, Christine. That's a really warm welcome, and hopefully I can live up to it in the stories that I'll tell about the leaders that inspired me and helped me become the leader I am today, and that I was when we worked together a few years back.

Christine Laperriere:
And you're currently CEO for DHL Express U.S. I should just mention that as well.

Greg Hewitt:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
So your career has advanced quite a bit in the years since we've worked together?

Greg Hewitt:
I guess so, but I'm one of those people that they talk about. There aren't many of us who are, I guess, are lifers. I joined the organization over 27 years ago, almost right out of university in 1993. And I'd been with, I was with a domestic company Loomis when I was recruited and we were acquired by DHL in around 2000. And I've been with the organization ever since in a number of capacities in Canada first for my formative years and then the U.S. and Europe. And yeah, I made the move down here after we'd worked together when I was the CEO in Canada for a number of years. I moved down here to the United States first into New York in a general management role. And then I've been in my role since the beginning of 2016.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm going to dive in, because the question that we all want to know is, who are your best bosses ever? I'd say best boss ever, but I know that for you there's more than one.

Greg Hewitt:
Yeah, I shared as we were coming on that I don't have just one. I have two leaders in mind who inspired me and helped me grow in different ways, and they're not dissimilar, but I think what I really think about with them is a little bit different. And those two gentlemen I'll talk about today are both DHLers, both long-term DHLers. One is Ken Allen, who's now the CEO for the DHL e-commerce solutions business in the DPE Group. But I worked for him first when I was the head of sales, marketing and customer service in Canada. And the second that I'll talk about as well is Mike Parra, who's my CEO for DHL in the Americas. And I've been working for him since I made the move from Canada back in 2014. And I think we all have a strong alignment in terms of values and beliefs that center us and allow us to work well together and see commonality in our approach.

Greg Hewitt:
Can I always relate back to really helping me evolve? We talk a lot at DHL and I think it's pretty common practice around leadership attributes to think about head, heart and guts. Those are, you hear those terms. And we've got attributes we assign to them can really help me a lot with my head attributes and probably a bit on the guts. Mike has really inspired me and help me build out my heart leadership attributes and the guts ones as well. So that's why I thought it'd be, if you'll allow me to share stories of both and how that's helped for me and to improve all three of those areas.

Christine Laperriere:
You've got my attention. So tell me, how do you, first of all, let's start with Ken. I had the luxury of working with him too and have incredible admiration for him. So do tell me a little bit more about how he helped you with building up that kind of head capacity of leadership?

Greg Hewitt:
Ken's a funny guy, because he would always say there's only one strategist in the company and it was him. You didn't need to be a strategist in your function, your area, your country. He led the strategy. He allowed us to help with that and build it out. But that's, he taught me a lot about really thinking through strategy and what is it that as a business you do really well and that you can excel at and that you should focus on to kind of, as the expression goes, to turn something that's good in to something that's great. And so he was a big believer in the profit service value chain and came up with our focus strategy, which was that motivated people will deliver great service quality that'll build loyalty in your customers and lead to a profitable network.

Greg Hewitt:
And that value chain, he really tried to simplify it and helped me and have helped our organization as a whole. He's written a book called Radical Simplicity. It really was about, if you motivate, get and keep your people and you make them happy and you invest in them and you empower them, they really are going to have a focus on delivering exceptional service quality. And in our business, which is a service business, if our people give exceptional service quality and really put the customer, their heart and care about it, chances are your customers will feel that. They'll know that you care about them and you won't give them a chance to leave.

Greg Hewitt:
I'll jump around a bit. But I'll never forget when he asked me, I was trying to explain, he was new in the CEO role and we had a real issue. I call it a leaky bucket challenge, right? Where I was talking about what a great job we were doing in sales. "Look at all this acquisition, all these new customers we were bringing on, but the revenue wasn't really growing that fast." And he looked at me and he said, "What if we just kept the ones we had?" He said, "It seems to me like you're losing more business then you can possibly bring on. But what if we refocused our energy?" And I said, "Ken, you just don't understand. We make mistakes in this business. We're not perfect. You're never going to keep them all, it's really competitive."

Greg Hewitt:
And then he challenged me, said, "Who do you bank with?" And at the time I was like, "Okay, I bank with the Royal Bank of Canada, RBC." And he said, "How long have you been with the bank?" And I sat back and I said, "Well, I think since my dad, when I had a paper, took me over as a kid and I opened a savings account." And he goes, "Exactly, why have you never left the bank?" And I go, "I don't know." He goes, "Has your life changed over the years?" And of course I'd grown up, gone to university, I had to have a bank account for that to pay for things. I'd worked, started working, bought homes. "Because every time you had an issue," he said, "they were there to help you. And they cared about you and they gave you no reason to leave." So he totally shook my foundation on, well, how we should view a customer and look at service. And he said, "I just want you to focus all your energy on our existing customers by understanding what we're doing wrong and why they're leaving and how we can fix it."

Greg Hewitt:
And the slant to that was back to, I bet you it's that we've got people that aren't caring or don't understand what they need to do, but let's just fix it. And it was to me a radical strategy. What if when I said, "You cannot open another new account. You cannot bring on a new customer till you fix why we're losing customers." So when we said that and I told the sales force this and we talked about it in our regional meetings with the team from the U.S. and the team from Mexico, people thought we were crazy. But sure enough, six months into that strategy where I could not open a new account, amazingly our growth rates were higher than when we were acquiring all that new business. And of course, he saw it further down the road. Once you fix the problem and you were really focused on measuring what the problems were, the issues and getting the service right, then you can reopen bringing on new customers and your growth rate accelerates even faster.

Greg Hewitt:
And that's just one example of him as a strategist, challenging the status quo, being brave enough to make decisions that most people would not take. And to think about a problem in a different way, to not just do what you've always done. And so sometimes that will come from his brain or your own brain. But the other side to it is you have to be open to new ideas, different ideas, different approaches. And that another thing Ken was very good at was making sure he was willing to listen to anyone and everyone, and to hear where the problems are, what the issues are, and then would put the resources on to tackle it. As a strategist, really embraced talking to the business at all levels. We talk about spending 70% of your time on the floor and in the field. Ken was never afraid to walk the dog, talk to the couriers, talk to the front clerks who work our front counters, talk to the sales people.

Greg Hewitt:
He didn't confine himself to an ivory tower. He didn't just value the opinions of his executive team or his peer group. He really valued listening to everyone. He told me one of the things that he liked about me was the first day he came in on the job and he was going around. He came to my office and we sat down for 30 minutes and he asked me for a state of the business from a field sales and national account and marketing standpoint. And I gave him my lay of the land. Here's what's working, here's what's, there weren't a lot working, but here's what's not working, what we need to do. Took that and he said, "Okay, now I want to just, I want to get a feel for the team and okay, so where am I going?"

Greg Hewitt:
And I said, "Well, I'm going to hand you off to Andrew Williams. He's my director of field sales and he'll get it started. But in this office you've got field sales, tele sales, national accounts, marketing, just about everybody in here. And I think I'm just going to have them hand you off. And I want you to spend the morning getting to know the business."

Greg Hewitt:
And he stopped me and he said, "You mean, you're not coming with me. Well, if you want me to hold your hand, I'll gladly walk around with you." And he said, "No, no, no, I don't want them, but why do you feel you don't need to come with me?" And I said, "I know this team, I trust this team. I know that anything they tell you will be relevant for you. And there may be things that I don't know like that I'm not seeing that you might see, but in general there's nothing they can tell you that I don't know, or that I'm embarrassed by, ashamed by, or worried about. So I'd rather you hear it direct from them and not have anybody feel like they've got to hold back because I'm standing over your children."

Greg Hewitt:
And he's, "Okay." And he went off and he came back and he shared with me that he'd been doing this in every function in every area. And he was pleased that I was as connected and open with the front line as he expected his leaders to be. And that I was confident enough that he could go and ask anyone anything. And I wasn't afraid, ashamed, embarrassed, or felt the need to control and to wrap. And he said, that said a lot because other people were kind of controlling who he could see. And they didn't get that eventually he's going to find it all out anyways. But that was a bit of what he taught me, the value of getting in front of everyone and being open to the answers.

Greg Hewitt:
And you know this, a company you work for helped me see it as well. That all the answers you need are here in your business. It's not somewhere else, it's not outside. If you're open and you listen, you'll get enough data points and enough information to kind of center in on where the right answers are to solve problems. So for me, a big part of what he taught me was the importance of being out in the business, connecting to my team at all levels. He reinforced something that I think was in me and was very natural, but that was important to me. That's another one of the things that he taught me. He really helped me see that you have to assess, you have to understand how big the problem is, and you can't be afraid to take dramatic action to really make a difference and get to a point where you're level and you can grow from that.

Greg Hewitt:
And that meant doing things like radically changing org structure and cutting a number of layers of management out, that as well, when I talk about learning, I love that he felt confident enough in me that as a new CEO in Canada, with a finance background, he said, "I'm not going to replace the CFO. We don't need a CFO. I know how to be a CFO." But he said, "What I do need is it's probably too much for me to have all of the responsibilities. So there are a couple of finance functions, namely billing and credit and collections that would go to the CFO. Well, I want you to take it. So I want you to be my senior vice president customer. And so that means any customer touchpoint, all of sales, all of marketing, all of customer service, all what we now call order to cash, billing, credit, and collections. I want you to own it all. And you own the whole customer life cycle."

Greg Hewitt:
Gave me a different perspective. It gave me new experiences. It built out my breadth and experience. And that's a hallmark for him. He'd make difficult decisions. He would be willing to do more with less, but he was also always willing to take a chance. And he didn't have to have all the experience in the world to justify getting, being put a role or trying something else. He gave me opportunities to do things that others had not, and to prove myself. And I think that he taught me the importance of that. Sometimes by beating it over my head by saying, "Why are you thinking about this when you should give this young person a chance? Or this person who works for us, but might be two levels down, let them climb up. Why are you going outside and bringing someone in, give him a chance, Greg." He was very good at that at seeing the best in us and in doing so.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is an amazing story. And then, it's funny. I'll just mention this, that when I think of my experience of Ken Allen, I remember I was only 28 years old, I think at the point that I was leading up those restructuring projects. And I do remember going into a meeting with him and he was so interested in my point of view. And I was so intimidated because I wasn't used to anybody with that much authority being genuinely interested, but not because he was trying to hang me out to dry. He was genuinely interested because he believed I had value to add. And that actually was almost disorienting for me at the point in which I had that meeting with him because I thought, "I'm just not used to people being genuinely that interested in my point of view, I'm early in my career." So now I'm so curious. Can you tell us if Ken was that earlier in your career, what is Mike like now today?

Greg Hewitt:
To me, Mike, he just brings a level of heart, a genuine passion and love for people. The empathy and a understanding the emotional quotient, the high EQ of just connecting with people and genuinely wanting everyone to succeed and to do well. And again, very similar, where Ken would walk around and meet everyone for their point of view and their opinion, Mike's ability to connect on a personal level and at all levels. And I've watched him do this from Santiago, Chile, through Vancouver, Canada at every stop in between he develops that relationship. And it's so genuine from I'll watch him with the cleaning crew at our Miami-based station, which is close to his home that sometimes he works at, is the same level of respect and discussion as he would have with myself or a colleague in the boardroom. He just genuinely loves people, cares about people, really believes that the work that we're doing and we talk about with our heart, having a purpose of DHL, we say it, "Connecting people and improving lives."

Greg Hewitt:
And what I challenge my team and Mike does a bit the same is, you have to find more than just your job or the career. It's what is our purpose? And for, we've used phrases like, "Every package has a story." And challenging everyone from a courier to a CS agent, to an executive to say, "What is that story? That interaction you've had with a customer or an employee or something that connects at a higher level?" He just does that each and every day. And he makes me feel special. He makes me feel valued. I know that when I sit down and talk about my career or, but whether it's personal or professional, a tremendous level of trust, because I know that in his heart he wants me to be happy. He wants me to excel. He's not afraid, and I, this is where I ... This isn't someone who isn't prepared to be tough on you, challenge you, demand great results.

Greg Hewitt:
It's just someone that in his core, I know that everything that he's doing comes with positive intent for everyone. And that he does not have in him any bone of disingenuine politics. There's no angle that he's playing. Everything he's trying to do is, I liken it, I talk about, there are people in this world who walk around trying to kick the podium out from under people who are doing well, drag them down to their level. And there are people that spend their entire life trying to drag people up on the podium with them. I've tried very hard. I think Mike is one of the greatest ambassadors to trying to get everybody up on the stage with him, to share in that success, to share in the happiness that he has. And for me I try to role model myself with those same values that I always assume positive intent.

Greg Hewitt:
I always try my best to stop. And he's helped me a lot with my listening skills and to not just respond, to respond, but to really try to listen and walk a mile in the other person's shoes. And think about and understand what it is that they need and want, and has really helped me embrace helping develop my team and at least the level below by focusing on employee development reviews, consistent individual performance plans that have really strong development goals that either will help a skillset, a capability or a leadership attribute that genuinely will help improve me as a person and help my career. He really helped me bring focus to that and commit time and energy to it. And I feel that that's part of what's making my team better and stronger. He helped me understand that what had gotten me to being the GM in New York, and wasn't what was going to make me successful in this next role. That I was now going to be leading people who had as strong a resume, as smart as me as talented as me as much.

Greg Hewitt:
And he said, "You're going to have to learn what motivates them, what excites them and get them to buy in and trust that you care as much as they do about their success. And if you're able to do that, you'll unlock tremendous potential." And I think he has a tremendous self-awareness that I recognize in myself and try to have. This ability to be ruthlessly honest with yourself, to understand what your strengths are, to understand what your opportunities are. And in today's day and age is where the difficult situations around diversity, equality and inclusiveness, recognizing some of our unconscious bias and recognizing that even when we're really good people at harp, we have biases and we might not always be right. We might have blinders on. We might not see things, he's helped me and embraces this idea of, we need to make sure we get as many viewpoints around us to help us make decisions.

Greg Hewitt:
Because even though we make a lot of good ones, there may be things that we miss. And so, he's really helped me by showing a willingness to surround himself with good people and diverse with a diverse background, to make sure that we're making the best decisions. And so that's where I think if Ken was more for me about focusing on clear priorities, measuring and driving and delivering great results, understanding how to leverage strengths and strengths of people to move the business forward, Mike has really helped me with finding and speaking to my purpose and the purpose of the business. Building trust, not only within my team, but with customers, and then trying to work through this idea of remaining positive and strong and stable and calm in a changing world, which is the sign of a good leader or as a hallmark of a good leader is being able to stay positive, to be able to be that calm voice.

Greg Hewitt:
As much as you can, you can't change, I don't think you can completely change your personality. I'm emotional, I'm fiery, that's part of my passion. But to find a way to use that in a really positive way, he's really helped those. And so when I look at all those attributes together, those are some of the things that they both helped shape and round me. And I looked to, what would Ken do? Or what would Mike do in different scenarios to say, "That's my compass and a guiding light on decisions I would make and the way I've structured it."

Christine Laperriere:
It sounds like an incredibly well rounded education you got from the two leaders that you got an opportunity to see in action and be up close to. So then I just have to ask you maybe the really quick thoughts on, we talked about this. Sometimes you learn the most from the leaders that don't classify as the best boss ever, any big lessons that you want to share there?

Greg Hewitt:
Yeah, I have an individual and I think the best way is I've modelled myself on not saying bad about anyone. So I'll keep them as the anonymous source. When we went through a reorg at the organization, I had a leader that I think the job was too much for him. I always chalk it up to, I tried and gone back to understand the why, and I think the scope of what he was being asked to do, it was just too much. And part of that goes back to when I look at him is he was very good with the sizzle. There wasn't a lot of steak. I think he'd spent so much of his career positioning himself, looking right, saying the right things, managing up, that he forgot that at one point it would come to roost because if you don't really understand the business and get into the details and genuinely care about everyone, that the big size business you can't skate forever.

Greg Hewitt:
And I think this individual did a great job. And in some ways he was brilliant, in front of a customer, in front of an audience, scripted. He was a great order, a good communicator, and he looked the part, but there wasn't the depth. And that meant at times he wasn't able to make the difficult decisions. He didn't trust himself. And so the biggest mistake that I think he made was that he didn't make any decisions. He didn't, when two companies came together, he didn't choose a path of A or B. He just kept blending it together. I remember being almost a year into the restructure. And his answer was to go to, I call it the famous offsite of, and this is the February Ken talks about. Instead of, when we should have been looking and saying, "Why did we lose $11 million," we flew off to New Orleans to have a retreat and discuss it with a facilitator from KPMG.

Greg Hewitt:
And I remember it was not going well. It was all going sideways. And he got very angry with me when I was sharing some, "Here's some things you got to stop doing." And I remember I just kind of ended it and said, "Listen, this is irresponsible what we're doing. The number one thing you could do, the only way you can justify what we're all doing down here is if you come back with half of us. So what I would do before this meeting is over in the next two days is I'd fire half of us. Then when you go back, you'll have credibility because at least you will have gone and made a decision. Now, the way you're yelling at me, I'm going to go write my name on the board, because I'm pretty sure I'm not the guy you're going to pick for this one. So I'm going to put Anthony's name up here and my name-"

Christine Laperriere:
I'm on the fired list.

Greg Hewitt:
"Now you don't." And I said, "And you've got all mad at me. What are you talking about?" This is, and he's yelling at me. And I pulled out the book and I asked him, "Have you even read this?" And I probably used a couple of explicits at that point. And I said, "Have you even read this F-ing book?" And he's looking at me, "Of course I have." And I said, "Well, let me go. Chapter one. Well, you didn't do that. Chapter two, didn't do that. Chapter." And I threw it on the table and I said, "You didn't even follow the one book you handed us as your charter, your what we're going to do. You never followed one of. So I'm going back to one, make a decision, fire half of us." Now, looking back, I'm pretty lucky as he didn't fire me, he didn't take my advice.

Christine Laperriere:
It was a gutsy move.

Greg Hewitt:
About a month later, and I tie this back to what I've learned, I was lucky enough to meet Ken Allen who was brought into be his successor and run Canada. And for me, I'd learned a lot in what not to do. And Ken would often tell me, "A great leader," the biggest thing, and this is this focusing on clear priorities and being results-driven, "A great leader doesn't tell you what you should do or you could do, a great leader helps people understand what not to do. Because if you understand what not to do and you stay focused on the other things, the odds are you'll be successful."

Greg Hewitt:
As he would say to me, "Greg, you can sit there and tell me, you guys started a lot of great ideas, you just never finished any of them. So why don't we start by doing less, but let's finish them. And then maybe we can look at the next thing." So, to me that's, the guy I learned from was, I really felt you need to understand your business to get into the details. And I get feedback quite often now as a CEO, that when I meet with my functional teams for their quarterly updates, or I do a voice sub session, they come back to me and say, they're always amazed at how much of the detail I know. And I'm like, "Well, I really do listen. I work closely with your, I give credit because my leaders are amazing in all my functions and areas. But I do really pride myself on trying to understand that detail, because I think it's important to make informed decisions." And I learned that from Ken.

Christine Laperriere:
There's always a debate about investing in leaders to help them become the best bosses ever. What is the impact to the bottom line of that, right? You would know that, there's that moment where it's like, is it worth spend ending X? Because these results sometimes are subjective, right? It's their culture. They're how you feel when you go to work. Any quick thoughts if somebody was contemplating investing in their people, in their organization, what would you tell them?

Greg Hewitt:
It's a must. This is a great wrap to go back to the first CEO that I spoke to, which is Ken Allen. Other than the big decision to get out of the domestic business, which was brave and cut losses, the second biggest decision he made was to create something called the certified program. He called it the Certified International Specialist program. And it was a learning and development curriculum that everyone from a courier and frontline, accounts receivable clerk, CS all the way up to him as the CEO, everybody took those courses. Those welcome to my country. Welcome to my function. Welcome to my company, so that we could develop a common language across 220 countries and territories around the world. We've continued to invest in that program. It just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

Greg Hewitt:
And I would say when people ask me about what was the single biggest chain agent of change of a piece of change that went on for DHL, the introduction of that certified program, which later developed the certified international supervisory academy for supervisors who manage most of your frontline, the certified international manager program, that created that our culture. That taught us the behaviors. That taught us about our leadership attributes and that is what guides us.

Greg Hewitt:
And it meant that in a business that was doing well and growing it also in a lot of the early years, particularly when we developed the Certified International Manager program that we facilitate, we work with an external company NKD to build the content, but it was facilitated by DHLers or DHLers. There were a lot of leaders who were considered really strong people because of the results they produced, but when they didn't have the balance between results and respect that we saw as 21st century leadership attributes, that program helped us make decisions that people who may have been putting up good numbers still needed to go. And it allowed us to build and foster a culture that struck balance and allowed us to continue to grow. And I don't think any of us, the millions that we've invested in it, nobody, and continue to invest year in and year out, nobody has challenged or questioned how much that's brought to the bottom line.

Greg Hewitt:
In fact, one of the big fears we've had this year with the pandemic is because so much of it is done face-to-face, we haven't been able to do it with the same, I guess, velocity that we had before. And we're about to launch some of the modules and refreshers in a virtual environment and adapt them. But we know how important it is to get everyone healthy so we can get back to investing in it, graduating more supervisors from our academy. They talk about, nothing could be more important than when your son or daughter graduates from college if you knew their first job, they were going to go work for a supervisor who'd been given the skills to really coach them, to mentor them, to give them good direction. And who understood the balance between respect-based behaviors and results-based behaviors and could help set them on a great path for their career.

Greg Hewitt:
So anyone who's considering it, you can't spend enough. You have to find the right fit for your organization and not everyone can build it from the ground up. Not everyone has that luxury. So find an outlet, find course, find an individual that you believe in that you think can motivate you and your team. But to only sharpen your skills, your tactical, what I think of as more tactical skills, language skills, mathematical skills, selling skills, and ignore leadership attributes, is a mistake. I always say, our people when we're talking about them and seeing who are the next me's, the next people to sit in my chair were looking at both objectively their skills, their experience, their results, but equally their behaviors that are linked to their leadership attributes and saying, "Do they have strong in all those head, heart and guts attributes that we can work with and that we believe are the future leaders?" And if they aren't, how do we get them to help either within our own programs or through external coaches and systems that might help them develop and grow?

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you, Greg. That was a fantastic discussion and I really, really appreciate it. I'm sure people are going to enjoy listening and putting some of these things into practice. So again, thank you so much. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Title: You're driving too fast
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Hello, Demetria and thank you for being on the Best Boss Ever podcast with me today. I am so thrilled to have you here.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Good morning, Christine. I'm so excited to be a part of this with you, and to be able to have some dialogue around a very important topic with you.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. And just as we get started, I love to explain why I invite each person on the show. I've had the luxury of working with you for the past four years. And what I really admire about you, is how you have made a commitment to advancing, diverse women, in leadership, in the field that you're in, and I've just seen you take action on it, and create real lasting change. So, you're one of the leaders that I really look up to and hope to be like when I grow up.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Thanks to that compliment. Looking back, I'm a senior vice president now, of financial crimes at Scotiabank. And throughout my career, when I was looking up, I didn't see many women, and I didn't see many people who looked like me. So I didn't really have the luxury of a lot of help and support. And when I look at women in the industry today, and financial services, I feel like it's important for us to impart that information, let's help each other. Let's raise each other up, because that's the only way that we're going to get more women into leadership roles.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And like I said, it's been just a pleasure watching you put this to action, because you're making real change. And so, it's amazing, I get to see it. Do you have anything else you want to share about your introduction before we get started?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
No. I think from my background, you know who I am and what we do and I'm committed to inclusion and diversity, but, really creating a space for women to thrive.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. I'm just going to dive right in. Tell us about your best boss ever.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So when you, asked me this question, the thing that comes to me, or comes to mind, is the character traits that I've thought about. And I've haven't had one best boss. I've had best bosses throughout my career, and there are things I've liked about them. And I think the traits that I most, have enjoyed. One is that they are truly authentic individuals. And by that, I mean, they're so down to earth, despite their title, you never feel like you're speaking to somebody that you should be afraid of, or shouldn't show your true colors to. They're very genuine, in both your personal and professional development. And you'll notice that they operate that way, both in the office and out of the office because, truly, the individuals that I've interacted with who, I still know, and I would very much, go work for them in a heartbeat. Because they really left a strong impression on me, around. They cared about me as a person and had a vested interest in me.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
They offered me trust, right from the very get go. So they considered me a subject matter expert. They considered me someone who could do the job, whatever job or role or function I had, they didn't question me. They simply asked me to start doing things, whether that was, put a 90 day plan together, or hire up a team, or execute on a strategy, they immediately left me with, your cup is full. And I'm not, having to let you validate yourself for me to trust you. They right off the bat wanted you to shine. And then I think, the last trait I would say that was, obviously very... Or left a good impression on me was, they were situational with me, in that, if I needed how up and support they were there, I could ask questions openly, and I never felt it was a dumb question.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
I could ask questions around their style. Like how do they want me to interact with them, or a specific meeting. They allowed me to ask about the audience, the person. What things am I walking into that maybe nobody else would know? And, they didn't make me feel or give me the impression that, I was a failure because I was asking, it was more of, how can I help you to succeed? And when I really did do stuff that, was probably offsite or they felt could have been done better, even in their feedback, in their constructive feedback, to me, they never made me feel small, or a person who was invalid because of that one situation. So when I think again about the characteristics of the great bosses that I've had, it's absolutely authenticity, trust and, driving the situation each and every time, as a unique opportunity. And for me, those are the traits that when I think of a great boss, those are the ones that sort of last in my mind.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. And I love that at list. Can I ask you to give some detailed examples? I'd love to hear. Walk me into a room where you're getting feedback from one of these bosses that has, some of these great characteristics. What does that look like? So you just did something that, could have been done better. They're giving that feedback to you, in a way that doesn't disengage you. Tell me, what does that look like?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
I think a lot of women probably get the same feedback around. They were either too aggressive or at some point, or too assertive. There probably isn't a woman that I don't know of that hasn't been told that. And so I've been given that same feedback at some point, but, with those individuals who gave me that feedback, they offered first and foremost, the opportunity for me, to impart what I think happened in the meeting, how I saw it, and what I thought occurred. And then what they shared was, their feedback. And their feedback wasn't negative. They simply offered, their observations and perspectives. And so in that situation, they said, when you came forward and provided your opinion, at that executive steer core, it felt like, you were to trying to drive to a conclusion, without allowing the audience the time, to absorb the recommendation.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So you were driving a little too fast, versus allowing the audience to say, "Okay, let's pause on that recommendation, and allow that executive team now to own that decision, versus you felt like you were trying to drive it within seconds." And that actually made me stop and think, and I thought, gee you're right. And what was going on in my head was, typically these meetings, aren't more than 30 minutes. So, I'm such a driver, but I'm also very aware of the time, and the clock ticking. And I want to get to the end of the meeting, and I want to complete the meeting and its totality. And sometimes, you have to recognize, that it may take longer than one meeting, even if the outcome was you needed that decision today, you may have to drive in that meeting that, if we don't drive to this decision today, here's what's going to happen in the next two weeks. Are we okay with that?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
That really allowed me, to kind of step back for myself and go, oh my God, I did do that. Oh, and I see that now in a different light, they gave me that feedback, or that person did. And it certainly didn't come across negative, but it gave me such a perspective into my own behavior, that it was like a light bulb. And I was so aware of it, that every other meeting that I was going into, I was now cognizant of, I've been doing the work, driving the work, but the recommendation is for them to rally around, is for the them to own. And so, if they need a bit more time, absolutely I can drive the figures, the facts, the information, and that is going to help them drive the decision. And that's what I need them to own, is the risk or the decision or the issue. And that was such a light bulb moment for me, it was an aha moment, but it really did change the course of how I behaved in certain types of meetings and or how I even behaved with my own team.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that story. And it's such a good example because, what I notice is, some of the best bosses, first of all, give real feedback, not just, "Oh, you're doing great. Don't worry about it." And then all of a sudden, at the end of the year, you get stuck with this surprise performance review, right? But then, sometimes I'll hear these stories where people are given, feedback that feels unfair or difficult or hard to hear, and it's very disengaging. And so you take these very high potential people, and you demotivate them along the path, and then they become scared or they fear operated. And that doesn't make any of us perform better. So, I love this example where you said, you got to share your observation of what you saw happen. They got to talk about their observation of what they saw happen. And then, you were really able to take that feedback, as a giant aha moment, because, what your intention was, and how you were being received were two different things.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
And it wasn't even delivered in such a way where you felt, that you were being scolded. Like it was more, can I offer you this observation? Here's what really needs to happen, is these people need to own the decision yet you're driving it. So, give it time to breathe. And then that was me just understanding that, hey, it's not about me in that moment, driving to the decision or the time, trying to get to the end of the meeting, get the job done. It's really about them. So how do I help them get over? And that just completely changed my own perspective.

Christine Laperriere:
When you think of... First of all, can you tell us what are some of the characteristics of the not best boss that you've seen in your own career? Well, words of wisdom for people listening.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
I'd say it's sort of the opposite of the characteristics that I talked about. So one is, individuals who are passive aggressive, which, to me really reflects, I'm nice to you in person, but then behind the scenes, I'm operating in a way that feels deliberately intentional or disrespectful of you. And, and that shows up in many different forms, whether, that's bullying tendencies, or in authenticity. So, like they're just to get you to get to the answer that they want to hear and start to be done with. And I also think it's micromanagement. I've never been good at being micromanaged. I am very much a person who likes to drive my day, my outcome, my team. And so when, that's all sort of blocked in, if you will, it doesn't feel empowering or very freeing or the ability to generate creativity and sort of be yourself.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So when I think of those traits, those are the characteristics that... And you can see it very quickly. You have to think, I'm in this role, I'm observing it. What am I learning from this moment? I'm a firm believer that things keep coming to you until you learn how to deal with them. It's also your time to learn about yourself, whether that's tolerance, whether that's the ability to respond in a respectful way, you don't want to be the individual, you don't like the characteristics of. But you still learn something from it. And in that period, you're also deciding, is this the job role or career that I want? The reality is, sometimes you're given those messages through people, to really help drive. What excites you, what makes you passionate every day and makes you want to come to work and be your best authentic self.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Sometimes it's those things, that trigger the change. Nothing else COVID has shown us, is the opportunity to be reflective internally, about just how much we can take as people, and how much we need each other to be successful.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I like what you're saying too, because it's funny how, working for the not best boss sometimes can... It creates a choice. Like, you have this moment where you can either mirror the same behavior back. So I know I get into a lot of conversations with clients where the instinct is, for example, passive aggressive or micromanagement, all of a sudden they start to become, passive aggressive or micromanagement. And I always say, this is what culture looks like. People don't understand what culture is. I'm like, culture is this intangible thing, but it's, we all mirror each other, in a way. So, to your point, you have this opportunity where you can either behave like that person or you can become much more rooted in your values and make a much stronger effort to not be those things.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Yeah. Have you ever been in a meeting where just everybody's trying to talk on top of each other and, create a point or be heard? And I'm always one of those individuals in the meeting where, honestly, if I have a point to state, I'll either raise my hand through the team's meetings nowadays, or wait until there's a pause. But, to say that I have to say something in that meeting, because I feel like the behavior has to be mirrored, used to be a point in time where I felt that pressure, and now I feel like, no, that's not me. I'm going to speak when it's relevant. When I have something to say, when it's important for me to state something. And if someone's already stated the same thing, and me just trying to do it in a different way to be heard, it's not a good use of my time. So it's almost like that, I don't want to mirror behaviors or mirror somebody else's approach, because it's the expected norm. I want to be me.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's that holding onto authenticity, right? One of the questions that I always get is, how good or bad leadership actually impacts the bottom line? I think a lot of people say, this intangible leadership stuff, it really doesn't show up. Let's invest in sales training, maybe we can see it in revenue, but when it comes to leadership and soft skills, a lot of people debate what the actual impact is. If you can think of, maybe the difference between your best bosses and you're not best bosses, what's the impact to the bottom line that you've seen?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
So there is personal and I think professional impact, and I do believe it's tangible, but we just haven't found ways to effectively measure it. I have been in roles where, I'm beyond excited to get up in the morning. I show up happy. I show up where I need to go. I've got more ideas than I can deal with. I am excited to, move the company forward and, it's observed by, I would say different things that, we don't generally measure because, once you get to a senior leadership position, whether you are a manager, director, whether you're a VP, people stopped looking at the time that you put into the company. It's just the expected norm. But I've worked 80 hours a week. And that would be the standard I would, work weekends and it didn't feel like I was working. Like I could still do more, so much so that, my days fly by, I'm working with my team.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
We're, working through ideas, or different things. And we're producing things I'm taking on extra work. So I'm asking for extra work, and not intentional to prove something. I'm just like, I'm so excited and this connects to X. Oh, okay. Can I take that on? So it shows up by the virtue of the fact that, because you're excited and happy and you're finding different ways to contribute. You're getting not just your work done, but you're doing additional work. And I've had one of my bosses tell me this. Like I just don't know where you get all this energy to do this. And you're often doing things that don't even belong to you. Whether it's a deck, whether it's a presentation, whether it's an analysis, you're like, "Okay, this person hasn't done it yet. Or that team hasn't gotten there. Let me start for them."

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Doesn't mean that you've finished it all that you've gone ahead because, you're just so driven that you want to do the work. And I think, you just see that helping others, asking for more work, being open to ideas, being open to collaborating, those are all the intangibles that we can't effectively measure. The only thing that most companies measure is over time, but that's just one indicator. And frankly, a lot of us don't even track overtime anymore. We don't even bother, logging it because there's an expected perception that, there is no nine to five anymore. So if you think about an employee who demonstrates those traits, then you know, there's a positive impact to the bottom line. And you don't have to be in a revenue generating line of business, to see it because, all of us contribute, whether it's a back office, whether it's sales, whether it's operations, whether it's technology, we all have something to contribute to the organization. We just do it differently. So when I think of productivity impacts, absolutely, they're real. They just don't show up, in a way that is easily measured sometimes.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly what I see. I just see the productivity and also the creativity. So the way you solve problems, when you're in a good state of mind and you feel valued, your ability to access more creative thinking is so much more. It's available, it's just like you said, when you show up and you're in a great mood and you're like, I can't wait to see what happens. And then you throw seven different ideas of how to solve a problem on the table. You can really see those things, but, when you're scared of a boss or you're worried that it's going to cause more work, or if you open your mouth, you're going to be seen as stupid or it's going to hurt your reputation, we stop creative thinking.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Think of ourselves as individuals, right? When we're open, there's just so much more that you're willing to receive. And yet if you're in a negative space, whether it's because you're afraid of your job, you're afraid of your boss, or maybe there's even a personal situation that you're dealing with. And there's just so much additional pressure, your ability to think, gets snared. It could be the smallest of things. I recently had a back injury, that injury truly had me not being able to roll out of bed. My ability to lead my team or think through, when I'm physically feeling pain, is that much more limited. And I have to rely on my team to do more. And that's just a physical injury. Imagine emotional injuries, that we are feeling, that are constant, right? You're going from, I think the average is, 11 to 15 different conversations in a day. And so contextually, it's not the same person. It's not the same emotion or the same feeling in every single meeting. And it's just building and building and it's like a pressure cooker, right? It's just boiling over. It's waiting to boil over.

Christine Laperriere:
This has been fantastic. If you have any words of wisdom, to leave everybody with, I'm going to ask you to share those. And especially given the fact, as we talked, as we were kind of, pre-interviewing, how challenging COVID is right now for the average professional who is home, and it's now been over a year and, some are parents and trying to juggle children. Do you have any really great words of wisdom for us?

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Well, I would say that there is no one answer to this, right? And we're all different. And so to respect everybody's individuality. So, for moms who are at home, who have children and are trying to deal with that, online learning, or just the fact that there are so many assignments, give them the freedom to do so. And again, they will, in productivity wise, be tenfold. If there are, are people that are struggling mentally, offer them venues, whether it's through your work or, being an empathetic person or just listening, because sometimes people just need to be heard. For me, it's been exercise. COVID as much as it's been the thing that has pushed us home and, pushed relationships back and had us all online, it really has made me think about my personal wellbeing, whether it's my relationship, whether it's my relationship with food or physical activity.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
When we were in the office, I was leaving home at 6:30 in the morning and not getting back until seven. And let's be honest. I was exhausted. There wasn't a lot of physical activity happening during the week. For the most part, I'd go right back online, and my activity would be on the weekends. And now I've really felt that my integration, is about me understanding what is more important to me. So again, returning to my authentic self, what am I willing to absorb? And what am I not willing to sacrifice it? Again, it's not necessarily the same every day. There are days. This morning I was out at six o'clock for a walk, because I know my day is full. But that's important to me. So I'm up and I'm not commuting anymore. I'm doing that. So, I think for each person, you really need to think about what's important, stay true to yourself, whatever that might show up, like, maybe it is having the courage to speak in meetings.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Maybe it is exercise as, maybe it's being intentional with your children now that you are at home and you have this time together, which we may never get back, who knows what our new normal will be, making sure that you are making decisions at the end of the day, that will lead you to be happy in your career, your job, your next role, whatever that might be. And in the moment we are all struggling, how do you help each other? Because that's what you can do as well. And, sometimes when you connect with someone who has the same thing going on, you don't feel alone and you're not alone. And the mere fact that you can share an experience, have a conversation, can very well carry you through. And, I think a lot of us do feel alone right now. So those would be my little tidbits of wisdom, if you will, that have helped me come through this.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
And I think we are still a long way to go. And each day, I really do try and get up and sort of wash the previous day off, and start with a fresh attitude, a fresh perspective, and really try to go into it with, today's a good day.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much, Demetria. That was amazing. And I really appreciate every minute I get to talk to you and learn from you. Thank you so much.

Demetria Ruggiero-Barbera:
Always a pleasure talking to you.

Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Sharon Giraudel

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. Sharon, welcome so much to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. And thank you so much for coming on the show.

Sharon Giraudel:
Thank you for having me.

Christine Laperriere:
Please introduce yourself.

Sharon Giraudel:
My name is Sharon Giraudel. I'm the Director of Human Resources at a mining company. I have kind of an interesting background in that I've worked in financial services, consumer packaged goods, and more recently the mining industry for the last nine years.

Christine Laperriere:
I have to say, the reason I had to have you on the show is I had the opportunity to work with you in the mining industry years ago even, to help with the advancement of women. We just had so much fun working together. I loved your insight, also the lightheartedness that you've brought to the conversation as well. So I really appreciate having the opportunity to work with you.

Sharon Giraudel:
Great. Yes. And we really enjoyed it as well. And I'm looking forward to working with you in my new role later on this year as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Let's just dive right in. Tell me a little bit about your best boss ever.

Sharon Giraudel:
Well, I'd have to say my first boss was an HR leader that I worked with about 15 years ago. And what I really liked about her was that she provided clear direction, empowered her team, and just created an environment where she really allowed us to be ourselves. The other thing that I really loved about her was she had the most infectious laugh, the type of laugh that actually would travel down the hallway, up and down the stairs, and right back all around. I'll never forget that we had a new VP that joined the company. And one of the first things he said to her was, "You laugh a lot." And her response was, I'll never forget it, "Yeah, I do. So get used to it."

Christine Laperriere:
I love that.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yes. It was just so awesome, and I'll never forget that. We worked so hard, but we had a lot of fun. The other thing that I really liked about her was she really helped our department transition from transactional HR to more strategic HR. Even when we went through so much, we went through an acquisition at the time. There were a lot of long hours and I'll never forget a colleague of mine reminded me where she said, "You know what, guys, we're working for chocolate and candy. Let's put things in perspective here. We're not solving world peace. So let's calm down."

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. We're working for chocolate and candy.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. So she just had this really nice way of putting things in perspective, acknowledging peoples in terms of their work and their contributions and just made it just a wonderful workplace for everyone. That was one boss.

Sharon Giraudel:
The second one is my current boss, I would have to say. And what I really like about him is that he has a nice balance and you don't normally see that at an executive level between the technical and the soft skill side. And he has this way of transitioning between each very seamlessly. The other thing that I like is that when I first joined the company, I've just been with the company for over a year, one of the first things that I heard from folks was that he really provided clear direction, and what they really liked about him was that he's not hierarchical. So like whenever he engaged with them, they felt like they were heard, that he didn't have this air about him, oh my goodness, I'm speaking to the president. He has a natural way about him. And it just made things very easy in terms of engaging with him as well.

Sharon Giraudel:
For him, the other thing that I really liked about him was that he just gave me cart blanche to say, "You know what, here's where we want to go as an organization. Here's the culture that I want us to strive towards. And so Sharon, just go do it." He just gave me the opportunity to really think about the ideas, engage my peers. And that meant a lot because we didn't know each other very well and it was just easy. So to this day, even now, he just says, "Sharon, you're the head of the people pillar, I'm trusting you. So just make it happen." And that means a lot.

Christine Laperriere:
A lot of people talk about best bosses, instilling trust or trusting their people, but a lot of the times we don't understand what that means in action. And so when you're telling that story, what I hear is that is the example of what trust looks like, where, no, I hired you. This is your expertise. Go for it. And getting out of their way. That's really what trust looks like in action.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. I think a lot of it has to do with, he has this entrepreneurial spirit as well, that has a lot to do with where he's coming from. When I work for very big organizations that are over 100,000 people, this organization is about 1,500, it's considered mid-size, I feel that sometimes the smaller organizations, you have more of that flexibility in terms of from leadership. That's been my experience where you don't have all of the hierarchy and it's just a lot easier to get things done. You pull people together, it's a smaller team and you can just move quicker. So it's just in terms of the trust. I do feel something that he learned from great bosses that he's had. And he's talked about some of the experiences he has had that has shaped him in his career. And I believe that he's paying it forward in terms of how he empowers his teams in day-to-day interactions.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I think that's the best part about working for a best boss, is it shapes the type of leader that you become because you see it and you know it works. And so it's easy to replicate. So what have you learned from your not best bosses?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yes. We've all had some of those.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly right.

Sharon Giraudel:
There have been many movies that have done quite well because of bad boss experiences. No, I'm joking. But I have had more, I guess, unfavorable experiences and what I will say though, and I think it's based on where I am in my career is that regardless I learned something from those experiences. So while in terms of the environment, it wasn't a positive environment, like the first example I shared, or my more recent example, there's still a lot of good things that I learned from them from a personal as well as professional level. Resilience is one, but even in terms of technical HR skills and looking at things differently, because some of the bosses I had didn't come from necessarily an HR background.

Sharon Giraudel:
I also believe, Christine, that you meet people in life for a reason, right? And so there's lessons to be learned, lessons that we take with us. Lessons will be repeated until they're learned. I believe that as well. Somebody said that. I don't know who it was. So I kind of look at it that, although they were challenging situations that I've gone through, I also grew from those experiences. It was kind of forced growth, to be honest.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. It wasn't my choice.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yes. It wasn't my choice, but you know what, I'm better for it. And so I'm just moving forward. I tend to try not to look backwards and that's what I took from those experiences.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I mean, when you say that, that immediately triggers something in my mind where I go back to some of my not best bosses, less about their leadership, but sometimes about their expertise and how much I really did gather from working alongside them. Even if I didn't necessarily enjoy their leadership style, I really got a lot from the way that they operated and just subject matter expertise or industry expertise. It's a good reminder, because we usually focus on the bad from those experiences, but also, you're kind of shining a light on the good things that we gain from those.

Sharon Giraudel:
I just don't think it's healthy to reflect and just take that negativity on. It's difficult to think that way, I'm not going to lie. It's difficult while you're in the middle of it. But coming out on the other side, there's a lot of things that I still leverage in my current job in terms of the technical expertise that I gained from those experiences. And so that's what I choose to focus on. It's made me a better professional, I think, as a result of that.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of one leadership practice that stands out from some of the leaders that you worked with, that you particularly enjoyed or found really valuable?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah, there's one that comes to mind and it was, again, the candy and chocolate company that I worked for. It was a leader assimilation exercise where during the first week that I had this new leader on board, we went through an exercise of just five questions that she took us through as a team. And just to help us get to know each other and understand our styles. The first question was, what's the ideal work environment that you enjoy? How do you make decisions? What does it look like when you're stressed? How do you show up when you're stressed? What is your preferred way of communication? And the last one was, how can we help you?

Sharon Giraudel:
And the reason why they're so top of mind is because I just went through this exercise last week because I have another new team member that joined my team. And so we went through this exercise and it's so interesting because each time I've gone through it, even with my existing team, there's something that we learn more about each other, even the ones that I've been working with longer. And even with myself, it was such a powerful exercise, just those five questions. But what I've learned is the sooner or the earlier, you take this approach and you get an understanding, the less your chances are you're going to have misunderstandings in terms of the teams and less assumptions. And so it's really powerful.

Christine Laperriere:
That is a fantastic exercise. Can you repeat those five questions again? I know most people are going to be doing what I'm doing, which is, oh god, I got to go back to that part where she just listed those five questions.

Sharon Giraudel:
The first one was, what is your ideal work environment? The second one was, how do you like to communicate? Third was, how do you show up when you're stressed? How do you make decisions? And the last one is, how can we help you?

Christine Laperriere:
Nice. I really, really like that process. I think you're right. Those are such important conversations. It's almost, if you think of it in context to dating, it's like do you want to live in the city or do you want to live in the country? Those are important things to make sure that the fit actually works, right?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. And I just found that they were so simple, five simple questions and we went through it. There are things that I had no idea, even with individuals that I've known longer on the team that didn't show up in the last time we went through the exercise. I just feel that they're just simple, powerful, and I really recommend them to anybody that's starting with a new team.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great. I'm going to be recommending that to people everywhere. That is a great practice. There's always a debate over the impact of best bosses and not best bosses to the bottom line or, for example, you and I know, we talk about investing in people and supporting people and what is the impact to the bottom line? So I'm curious in your expertise, especially given that you understand people in an organization, how important they are, but you also have to live with metrics and results as well, can you tell me, what do you believe the impact is to the bottom line of soft skills and great leadership?

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah, I mean, they are definitely underestimated. In my experience, you often see that individuals are rewarded based on their technical experiences. It's just natural versus some of the soft skills, which are extremely challenging. It's really, as I mentioned, the example with my current boss in terms of how he transitions from technical to soft skills, but they're so critical. And understanding people, understanding what motivates individuals is really what is going to help you get the best out of them in terms of results.

Sharon Giraudel:
And I also think about this model that a friend of mine introduced me to, again, at that same company, that chocolate company, and it was called PAMOD. And it was something like performance equals ability, times motivation, times opportunity, times direction. Right? If an individual is not at their best at any of those four factors, then that's going to ultimately impact their performance.

Sharon Giraudel:
And so I've found that this model, when I'm having a conversation with some leaders even, in terms of, okay, when they're saying that something may not be working, I try to say, okay, how do I put some of this into that formula? Are they motivated? Do they have the tools and skills that are enabling their performance? Is there the opportunity in terms of exposure, and what is the leader doing in terms of direction? Is their direction clear because often people assume that they're clear? And I think this remote environment has really taught us that as well, that it's so important to have those frequent check-ins because you don't have the luxury of just stepping outside the office or them coming to your office and asking for clarification, do you have a minute or whatnot? Right?

Sharon Giraudel:
So I think that in terms of all of those things really impact one's ability to be successful and a leader sometimes don't recognize that. They kind of put all of the ownership on performance on the individual and not understand the role that they play in terms of direction. That's the simplest way that I can explain it, if that makes sense.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I loved that explanation because I think there's going to be leaders that are listening to this right now, going, oh, interesting. Those four ideas make a lot of sense. And I guess, to your point, I always find leadership and people and culture so interesting because it's multiple variables at the same time playing out. So it's never just performance. It's never just expertise. It's like, but how do you unravel that? And I mean, again, it's hard to measure. I think your answer that it's highly underestimated is exactly what my experience has showed me is that it's hard to see it in the metrics, but I know when I'm working with someone who's disengaged or who doesn't feel motivated or valued, the results are significantly different. Do you have any last words of wisdom or tips for anybody that's listening today?

Sharon Giraudel:
One of the things that I think is hardest for leaders when they're thinking of their teams and performance is giving feedback or feedforward. And what I really like, I don't know if you've heard of Kim Scott, Radical Candor, have you heard of her?

Christine Laperriere:
Yes. Yes. It's great.

Sharon Giraudel:
What I really like about that model and just the concept is that you really are showing genuine care when you tell someone the truth. I really encourage people to be open and to share feedback in real time. And the way that I position it often, even in my informal and formal performance discussions, is that I need to tell you the truth because I do care because life happens, things happens. And if I'm not here or something happens, I don't want there to be any surprises. I want people to say... I don't want them to say, how come you're not aware of this, and if you're not aware, and if I don't make you aware, then I'm not setting you up for success.

Sharon Giraudel:
So I think it's so important and it's difficult, I know for some people, because they feel they're hurting somebody. You're not really doing them any favors by not telling them the truth. And in the absence of truth, they make up stories and that can be even more demotivating. And so my advice to folks is to really, if you are seeing that there are things that aren't making people as effective as they could be, whether it's through soft skills or technical, you really need to tell them the truth. And in real time, they'll be better for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. That is such a incredible piece of wisdom. I'm smiling because I can think of a time that I was presenting and someone who again, cared about my success came up and said, "You're using so much self-deprecating humor, you're actually hurting your own credibility." And I knew her and respected her and I'll never forget her giving me that piece of feedback after I had taught for the day. It was just wildly insightful. She literally changed the course and the way that I performed just by really giving me an observation that was authentic. She's like, "You know your stuff. You've got everybody's attention. You're not having any problem with that," but she's like, "Why beat up on yourself in front of people? It's not funny." And I was like, "Wow, I don't think I would've ever known. I always say it was that broccoli in the teeth moment." And it came from a caring place. So the ability to do that at the same time, it changes the way you pay attention to your performance in the future. So, I'm smiling while you mentioned that.

Sharon Giraudel:
Great.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, it's good. The Radical Candor is fantastic. There was so many good tips in here. So I have to tell you, I really appreciate this, Sharon. I'm going to probably have to listen to this a few times and make sure I capture all those good questions and that model that you gave. There are so many usable tactical things that we can action out of this. And then I'm going to take it back to the fact that I love the story of your first best boss with the infectious laugh. I've seen that in you, where when we work together, I feel like we always have a laugh, even though we roll up our sleeves and then we get down to work. So I think that's probably one of the things that stands out and why I really enjoyed working with you is I remember us having a laugh and talking about personal things for a couple minutes and talking about our families and then we roll up our sleeves and we get to work.

Sharon Giraudel:
Yeah. I think it's so important. Life is short. We're going through so much right now. I jokingly say that it'd be nice to put in our job descriptions must have a good sense of humor.

Christine Laperriere:
I like that. I'm going to add that to my job description too. I think that everybody can appreciate that. So, if you're listening today go have a laugh.

Sharon Giraudel:
That's right. Have a laugh.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much, Sharon, have an amazing day and we really appreciate your time.

Sharon Giraudel:
You're very welcome, Christine. And anytime.

Christine Laperriere:
And the reason that I brought Mike on the show, this is really actually quite special for me is that Mike was my first coach. So back in 2003, 2004, I got the opportunity to work with Mike as he coached me through really taking a deep dive into what I was doing, because I was a vehicle engineer at the time. And him really trying to help me understand who I was authentically and what kind of career I really wanted to lead. So I think it's pretty incredible. I thought he had the coolest job on the planet, at the time. So it is pretty incredible that today I'm a coach as well and kind of followed in your footsteps, but you were definitely part of the inspiration that led me down the path. So I am thrilled to have you on today, Mike.

Mike Lindstrom:
The best part is when student becomes colleague, at some point or vice versa, that's even better.

Christine Laperriere:
Why don't you share a little bit of your background?

Mike Lindstrom:
I mean, it's so funny because people anymore, they go on Google or YouTube or Wikipedia and they see all this stuff. "Oh he is a writer. He worked for Robbins', he's speaker and all that stuff." So I try to make it real simple. So I did go to law school, but I'm not a practicing attorney. So literally the month after I graduated from law school, the gentleman I'm going to probably talk about today. His name is Dan Lier was working for Tony Robbins, the motivational speaker, who I didn't know from anybody at the time hired me basically out of school to become a speaker and a coach working for Robbins for two years.

Mike Lindstrom:
We did speaking events on the road. And then in 2000, 2001, we started coaching company in La Jolla, California. It was called Robbin's Results Partnership. And we worked predominantly with entrepreneurs, salespeople making over a quarter million dollars, professional athletes and celebrities. So I helped Tony build the business and I told him it was time for me to spread my wings. I started my own coaching practice, not in direct conflict. He gave me his blessing and said, "Good luck and represent our brand well." And I never looked back, so here I am.

Christine Laperriere:
So, with that, then tell us more about this best boss ever? That's always the question.

Mike Lindstrom:
Yeah. So Dan Lier it's L-I-E-R, if you want to pull him up, Dan's in our industry, he's a speaker. He's actually the top speaker in Las Vegas. I mean, during COVID obviously was much difficult, right? And no assembly, no getting together live, so that hurt his business a little bit. But imagine you live right outside of Las Vegas, but you can do two or three keynotes a day, drive down to the Strip, work with some major corporation, get paid a ton of money, talk for an hour and go home, right? So he's got a pretty sweet gig, nowadays.

Mike Lindstrom:
But with Dan, I didn't know from anybody, he was a mutual friend that introduced us because my buddy had just joined the team at Robbins. He was from San Diego. He said, "You got to get in touch with this guy. Dan, I'm telling you, they're looking for more people. They want energetic people. People that are educated. They're going to really represent Tony's brand in the North American territory."

Mike Lindstrom:
Now, when I heard that word North American territory, I'm thinking, "Wow, this sounds like a travel job, right?" Sure enough, it was. We lived in five cities per year. So my first city was Atlanta, Georgia. Then in Philadelphia, San Francisco, LA, Chicago, New York, it was awesome. We'd live there for six to eight weeks. And we would basically promote the Robbins brand, but we'd also sell a one day event. It was called, The Competitive Edge at the time. Now it's Bunked. It's a different program.

Mike Lindstrom:
So Dan was literally the guy who hired me to join the traveling team. So, you imagine you have 12 people and this guy, Dan and his wife, Tammy at the time, traveling all over the country. So he was my boss day in, day out. We lived in the same community. We'd see each other on the weekends at the pool because we had corporate housing. We'd see each other at happy hours on Friday. So not just like a boss, you would go see at an office place. You're on the road living literally with this individual. So he literally took me under his wing. He's 10 years older than me exactly. So we just had so many things. He said, "You're me 10 years ago, man. I see myself in you. So I want to make sure you don't stumble the way I did." So, he took my success and failure very personally. I was lucky to have him as really my first real boss I would call him. And Tony was his boss. So I'm one degree removed from Tony Robbins himself.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me a little bit about when let's say the team had a mess up or they were doing something? Again, you're living with the person too, so that's not easy, but give me an example of how would Dan respond?

Mike Lindstrom:
And that was the other part about having him literally with us on the road, he would go out to meetings with us. So we had a script we had to follow to a T. I mean, Tony was really big on framing, context is what we call it syntax, the order in which you present information. We had to record ourselves, send videos in. Back in the day it was tapes, right, to Tony. He would review them and then give you feedback. But Dan would go out to live meetings with you. And I'll never forget this. My first cycle. That's what we call the city cycle, was Atlanta. And I'm fresh out of law school. I was actually the most "educated" person on the team. I was a little cocky, single guy, just kind of thinking I had this swagger.

Mike Lindstrom:
I was actually competitive. In law school we would do a mock trial. So I was used to being in front of a judge, a jury, speaking, presenting came very naturally for me. So to have Dan come out and ride with you, your boss come out and sit in the meeting and I would never forget this. It was a real estate company and he recorded it and we were in the car and he asked me a question and now I know this famous question. He says, "Mike, let me ask you a question. He goes zero to 10. 10 is the best presentation you've ever done for us. Zero is the worst ever. What would you rate yourself?" And I'm thinking, "Okay, loaded question. How do I answer this? No such thing as a 10, because you can always improve, right?"

Mike Lindstrom:
And I said, "I'd say an eight, I'd say an eight." And he just goes, "Wow. Wow." Never forget that. He said, "Two wows." Which I didn't know what that meant at the time. He said, "I would've gave you like a two." So we got a problem because you think you're an eight and that's a two. So we got a lot of work to do. So this weekend, I better not see you out at the pool. I better not see you at happy hour in the neighborhood. I better not see you out with the team. I want you to nail that script. If I knock on your door at eight o'clock Saturday night, okay. I want to see those big post-it notes all around your condo. And hoping you have walked and pasted that whole thing, 100s of times to nail the script because you don't have it nailed."

Mike Lindstrom:
Now that was my biggest first lesson is, "Holy crap. I'm not prepared. There's always another level." I mean, there's so much coaching going on in this moment, right? I didn't leave my apartment all weekend. I studied that script. I literally pasted that. I had the post-it notes of every chunk as we called it. And I did my meeting on Monday, did much better obviously, but he came out and rode with me a month later and he told me he was proud of me, which I appreciate. Having your boss and coach tell you, he is proud of you. But he said, "You still got work to do, buddy. You're the newest guy on the team and you still don't have it. There's tonality shifts. There's body language. There's certain anchors that have to go into that script that you don't have nailed." So I was kind of the first lesson of the worst case scenario for my own self. But I never saw like the veterans majorly screw up. I just saw myself screw up and I know how hard he was on me because you had to over prepare.

Christine Laperriere:
I love this story. This is such a great story, especially given that I work with so many sales teams, right? And we go through this, going on the road and people thinking they nailed it. And meanwhile, from a third party observer it's not close. Now, why did that not demotivate you? A lot of people listening would be saying, "Oh God, that's not my best boss. That's my worst boss."

Mike Lindstrom:
Right. Well, in the interview for process, Dan knew my background. I was an athlete growing up. So I played baseball, basketball, football. He asked me those kind of questions in the interviewing process. "Tell me about your background? Were you a competitor? Were you an athlete in any way?" So he knew I had that athletic kind of mentality, football mentality being in the locker room. He was a two time national champion basketball player at Fort Hays State. So, I knew he was an athlete and he understood that coaching element. Beat them up a little bit. Let them think they're good, but not really. And then, pick them up and you build them up.

Mike Lindstrom:
So we kind of knew that about each other. So I noticed he didn't do that with my friend, Tiffany, next person to come in right after me. She was the next rookie. Tiffany came in and I remember he tried that approach with her the first month and it did not work. She came home to the apartment, crying in tears. "What did I do? Why did I leave my job to come out here and live with all you guys? I don't even know you guys." I said, "Look, I went through this, Tiffany. I'm going to help you out. I promise. We're going to keep you in and study your script." So, as you know, as a coach, you have to know how to tap into that person's motivation. Some people love the tough love and some people don't. I mean, we learned quickly that that didn't work for Tiffany, but that worked for Mike Lindstrom, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
So he changed his style for Tiffany, so she stayed on the team then?

Mike Lindstrom:
Yeah. She stayed on the team. In fact, she moved up to kind of like the next level team and really kicked butt. Dan was very adroit at kind of knowing what he was dealing with, with each individual, male, female, older, younger. Some of the guys on the team. If you remember, I was 25, 26 years old, right out of law school. We had had team members in their mid 30s closer to Dan's age. So he could kind of talk to them different. He was also a father. I wasn't, I was a single guy. So he would always kind of play the right angle. But he was very good at kind of knowing what he was dealing with.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And to me, that is definitely a quality of a best boss ever, who knows how to say, "Everybody on the team is important, but I am going to shift my style to build up everybody." But what I'm really hearing too, is that he took your performance or your capability and really did unleash it and built you up to a varsity player from a junior varsity, right? Or maybe a little leagues. You walked in the door and thought you were in the game but he was like, "No, no, no, you got a lot longer to go."

Mike Lindstrom:
Well, you know, what's funny? I mean, I'm not private about this. I'm very public about it, but I don't get asked these kind of questions about bosses and mentors. So this topic is near and dear to me. So I had a coach named Robert Alderman. Robert is a famous coach. He passed away, God bless, a couple years ago, lived about late, late 70s. He was literally Tony Robbin's coach, not mentor, Jim Rohn. Jim was his mentor, brought him up in the business. So he kind considered him as a mentor. He brought in Robert to coach him on understanding behavior, understanding the DISC, like a technical perspective.

Mike Lindstrom:
So once Robert and Tony became really close, Tony required Robert to coach all the leaders in the firm. So I got promoted to basically run that coaching company. Robert became my coach. So I had Dan Lier and Tony over here, within the company, my bosses. And then I had this coach outside of the organization that Tony said that, "You're going to learn a lot from this guy." And I remember the coaching being very different styles, but they were all saying the same thing. They're like, "Mike, your stint here at the Robbins Organization will be short because you're an entrepreneur, you're a high dominant person. You're a high influencer, low steady, low compliant. This is classic high D high I. You're going to learn and go. I mean, the fact that you've been here, as long as you have, we're surprised."

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Mike Lindstrom:
But that's important to know as a coach that you're dealing with someone and this is a story you and I had. When I saw your DISC profile and you're an engineer, it just didn't add up. I'm like, "Why is she doing this, when her profile tells me she should be doing this?" So, it's having that ability to adapt the styles based off that person's own style.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. That's fantastic. So we picked your brain on best boss. Now you've had a chance to work with lots of different leaders. I'm kind of curious, what are the trends you see in great leaders? Not just the vague piece, but give us the stories, give us the meat and give me the examples of those leaders where you really do see them break away from the rest?

Mike Lindstrom:
So you're right. I got caught up in after the Robbins days, I was a dotcom kid too. So I got lucky to find that whole wave same time, '99, 2000, 2001. So watching that startup mentality, believing in this brand, we're going to take it public. And everyone's drinking the Kool-Aid like I went through all of that. It was awesome. It was great success. Great failure. I mean, I made an amazing network of people. So I've been in and out of starterups over the years. Even in the cannabis industry, for example, someone would say, "Hey, you may or may not be involved with what the product is, but we need to build a company. Can we have you come in and help us because we like to replicate Fortune 500 companies in the industry, because it's never been done before?"

Mike Lindstrom:
To me, that's exciting because you're going to take a leader who started something. I don't care if it's a piece of technology or in the cannabis space, you're going to find a quality about the leader that they're trying to replicate. That's how you build a culture. The base word of culture is cult, common language, common belief, common direction. The problem is we think of Jim Jones in Ghana and 800 people drinking Kool-Aid that's what we think of when hear the word cult. Like Apple, Google, these companies are so cultish, Netflix, because they got everybody from the top down drinking the Kool-Aid. But they understand from at the top what they're stirring.

Mike Lindstrom:
There was a method and that's what I've learned over the years, watching great companies go from good to great. Jim Collins talks about in his book is that the great leaders are very methodical about what they're putting in the Kool-Aid. It's not accidental. They are being successful because they're driving home a certain thing during that meeting. They have core values that are literally published on the wall. Every single individual, like at Lululemon, they know purpose and why period. I don't care if you're answering the phones or you're an executive purpose and why is a big part of Lululemon's culture. So, that starts at the top, speed of leader, speed of pack.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is such a perfect example because I talk about that all the time. Like culture, I work with so many leaders and I'm always talking about how people mirror one another, they just do. We are humans and our brains are built to mirror one another. And you can watch us either subconsciously in a room when one person crosses their legs, you'll watch three more people cross their legs or one person yells at their employee and you watch three more people think that, that's what leadership is. They go to their next meeting and they yell at the next person. And so it is just phenomenal how you've explained culture and being intentional with it because I feel like I'm always trying to tell that story. I love the idea too, of the use of the word cult. You're right. It's got a negative pejorative to it. I guess it's not one that we use often, but it is what culture really is what it is, right?

Mike Lindstrom:
So Dave Liniger is the founder of Remax, the real estate company. And he's really progressive about training. And I've done training with those guys for a long, long time and Dave and I are friends. He lives in Colorado and he's got international franchise sales territories. So it was a couple years ago we had me come in as a keynote and a trainer. And we actually did some of the old school stuff. We did the board breaking and stuff that some people kind of see maybe as cheesy in the modern day. Tony Robbins still does a fire walk gimmicky or not, people are going to go do it.

Mike Lindstrom:
So I took a little couple just creative liberties. I said, "Do you guys know what a cult is?" Did the whole bit in front of the room. And I said, "You know, you guys are a cult?" Dave's in there, back in the room, laughing. They all stood up and clapped for themselves. They were so proud that they were being called a cult, the red, white, and blue balloon, whether it's recognized brands in the real estate industry in the whole wide world. They're proud of that. But you go talk to Dave Liniger and his wife that started that company in the early 70s when they flipped the real estate model on its head and said, "Why are we taking your commissions? You work so hard. Why don't we just take a fee, give you a 100% of your commission and let you be, build your own brand? Just go fly the balloon. We'll help you do it." Genius in 1972 or whatever it was. So to have him, tell you that he's very proud of that. It's because he knows the method. He knows what he is stirring.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that. I know some people are going to be smiling while they're thinking about that. Because you're right. We all know Remax. That's not a hard name to identify with. What an incredible brand. So any last kind of words of wisdom when you're thinking about all the people out are listening are in cultures where they're either high performers or they're on their way to leadership. And I'm really hoping that this show helps inform them about how they think about leading. I'd really like people to think, not just about being a good enough manager, but truly trying to be a best boss ever and really influence people's lives for the better. What are your words of wisdom for them?

Mike Lindstrom:
So the one thing that I've become more and more just congruent with probably the last five years, I mean COVID really helped me bring it home even further is when somebody hears the word brand, they think of a company, right? Apple, Google, Remax, et cetera. In sports, you have the logo on the front. That's the team, the logo that everyone recognizes, whether it's the Dallas Cowboys or New York Yankees, all these big brands in the world. But the name on the back of the Jersey, that's you as the individual. Being really mindful of your personal brand. Personal brand. You're not getting out from underneath the company brand and it's not selfish and it's not egotistical.

Mike Lindstrom:
You have to be mindful of your personal brand. How do people talk about you behind your back? If I interviewed three to five people in your company and said, "Hey, tell me about this individual. What's great about them and what's not great about them? Are you aware of that? Do you even know your own profile? Have you ever done the DISC profile or Drake or Dots?" And there's a million of them out there. You go learn all of that. Get coaching. I mean, that's why you do what we do. Watching that person really truly look introspectively and say, "I need to work on myself to be better within a bigger brand called the company." So I think that's something that gets lost.

Mike Lindstrom:
And I hate to say this and I won't name company names, but there are certain companies out there. They don't want that. They don't want you building your personal brand. They want you to be a worker bee. You show up at eight, get your one hour break at noon and you're off at five and we pay you the same money every two weeks. We don't want you to grow. We don't want to disrupt the apple cart. But that's a problem. Those companies will never have that big culture that you and I talked about.

Mike Lindstrom:
The Dave Linigers of the world, they would never go work for that company because they promote branding at the individual level. So if you want to really take a good, hard look in the mirror about the company that you want to work with, you want to look at, "Can I grow in this company? Do they invest in me? Are they going to give me grief that I'm going to go take three days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and need a day off without having to do PTO because I want to go to a seminar to be a better negotiator?" I mean, that's where you start to see, do they really believe in you? And I think that personal branding thing is so big and it gets lost for some reason in training.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that you're saying that. I'm grinning because I teach personal branding as a huge portion of a lot of the leadership programs that I work on. It forces you to reflect too. And it forces you to get authentic about what you're really trying to be as far as a leader. So if you go back to that idea of best boss ever, it makes sense that that person would be waking up knowing that they want to be a best boss ever. That was part of their personal brand. It was part of the intention that they were bringing.

Mike Lindstrom:
So I have one exercise. I'll give this to you. I don't remember if you and I did this, obviously I'm a journal guy. What's written is real. And I've been carrying this everywhere I go. And it's not a diary, people. It's a journal. It's a capture mechanism. It's a thought, it's a quote. It's a movie. So I don't sit there every night going, "Dear Mike. Oh, today was kind of a weird day." That's a diary. This is a journal. Journaling is something that you just have close to you when you have random thoughts. So here's a journal exercise. It's great prompt. Always date your pages. Date the page so you can always remember. And you ask this one question. I am at my best when..... And you fill up a whole journal page in bullet points.

Mike Lindstrom:
Now I know my journals have 28 lines. I've got six by nine. There's, 28 lines on this journal. That's at least 28 I have to answer every single line, 28 times. I am at my best when I wake up early. I am my best when I work out. I am at my best when I have private, authentic, real time with my kids every night before they go to bed. Whatever. I'm just rattling stuff off. But you got to create that best version of yourself because no one's going to do it for you. This manual, wasn't gifted to you in college or law school for me. I had to go find people like Dan Lier and Tony Robbins and Robert Alderman to force me to do these kind of things. So I looked in the mirror and said, "I am at my best When." And I know what that is. And I know when I'm not there. If I'm incongruent in any way, it's stressful. You know, when you're not at your best, you know this?

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Mike Lindstrom:
But, oh, I'm off to today. I've done it on stages. I've done it on coaching calls, but you have to have a blueprint of, "You at your best when," and really go in depth with that and be brutally honest with that.

Christine Laperriere:
Ah, what a fantastic prompt. I'm laughing because I actually use that as part of the personal branding exercises, such a simple way to tap into what your values are, what energizes you, what works for you. And I think that's a great call to action for people who are listening today.

Mike Lindstrom:
Love it.

Christine Laperriere:
Mike, this was fantastic. I really appreciate your time. Is there a simple way anybody, if they're listening right now, I'm sure they're going to be pretty fired up, how do they stalk you on social media?

Mike Lindstrom:
So I'm on all social. I mean, what I've been gravitating to more and more lately is LinkedIn. So I love connecting with people on LinkedIn. I've never turned down a request on LinkedIn. LinkedIn does a good job of policing its community. Facebook, I might not say that there's people I might accept or not. I'm kind of private about my personal stuff on Facebook, but in LinkedIn for sure. Mike Lindstrom, JD. That's my law degree. If you Google it, you can see the baldheaded guy. But my website is mikelindstrom.com There's a D in there. L-I-N-D-S-T-R-O-M. I'm in the process of redoing it by the way. So it may be up or down or not where I want it to be right now, but it's always going to be live. And all my social media links are on there. I have a YouTube channel that's attached to the website. So, that's easiest way. Just go to mikelindstrom.com or hit me on LinkedIn.

Christine Laperriere:
Lovely. Thank you so much. This was awesome. Thanks so much.

Mike Lindstrom:
You know what? I want to leave you with this. Because I have told your story on stages. I told you this before, and I mean this, I'm so proud of what you've done. Because going from being that worker bee, engineer type of job, right, which you can relate with, to go out there and want to change the impact of the world. How much money we make in the world is directly tied to the influence we have on how many people we influence. So if we only influence four people, well, you're going to get paid according to that. But if you go out and stand on stages and write books, you're influencing 100s of 1000s, millions of people, and that's not just financial wealth, that's the abundance of mindset and the sharing and you're doing that. I'm so proud of you and it's an honor to be on your podcasts and do this and have fun.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, thank you so much. And I love the fact that you are really the start of that journey. So it's so special to have you on. So thank you so much.

Mike Lindstrom:
Thank you. Appreciate you.

Christine Laperriere:

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast
Episode: 14
Title: Permission to express emotion
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Dr. Jessica Metcalfe

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever show. And today, I have on Jessica Metcalfe. Thank you so much, Jessica, for being on the show.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thanks so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
The coolest part is as we were on a panel together at the Women and Wealth Conference, not too long ago, and I found the stories that you were sharing about the dentistry industry, which is what you're in, it just was incredible to hear your perspective. And also, the fact that I guess, you learn leadership in a very different way than so many of us in the corporate world. So I just had to have you on the show. I love the fact that you bring a very fresh perspective to this discussion. So I'm thrilled you're here.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you so much. It's very interesting, exactly what you said with the dental industry. I do clinical dentistry, I own a dental clinic. And then, I started another business where I help individuals or the high achievers battle imposter phenomenon, perfectionism, and prevent burnout.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. And I mean, so many of us very much relate to that special business that you've created on the side. So I think that's very exciting. Tell us who is your best boss ever and why?

Jessica Metcalfe:
It's very interesting because no one person comes to mind. I have snippets from the leaders and the mentors or the role models who have been in my life. And the reason for that is because of the way dentistry is set up. And so, a couple of the individuals that come to mind are the ones who really pulled me aside early on my career and really wanted to know what my vision was within dentistry, with my own personal life, and how they could then help me strive for that, and how they would then fit into what it looked like for me.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And the reason why that was so important is because early on, especially when our high achieving mentality is get really good grades, get into school, get even better grades at that point in time, graduate, finish residency, and then become an associate or then become an owner and run your own dental clinic. And because you kind of get stuck in that hamster wheel aspect of next step, next step, next step, sometimes you don't give yourself that opportunity to breathe and take a look at the fact that what do I actually want?

Jessica Metcalfe:
And so, the individuals who really stood out for me are the ones who gave me the opportunity to share with them early on, being like, "Well, this is what I think." And then we would have a really honest and open conversation being like, "Okay, this is maybe where you need to take your energy. This is maybe the next education step that you want to take. And maybe don't jump in too far into the deep end, right off the bat with this," but not saying that you can't do it. So it's that empowerment aspect, which I find was consistent with the top bosses who come to mind for me.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you can think of, for instance, one of those leaders that had a specific characteristic or trait that you really admire, tell us a little bit more about them.

Jessica Metcalfe:
So this individual is so very calm and levelheaded, had been in the years for multiple decades. And there was one day where I was just having a really bad day in clinic and I just felt it was one of those kind of steam roller days. And it ended up at the point where I closed the door to my office and I just started crying my eyes out. And I was like, "I am not fit for this at all." So I was giving myself the moment. And I heard a knock on the door and he came over. And at this point in time, I know my eyes are super red. I'm trying to wipe the tears and I'm like, "Okay-"

Christine Laperriere:
Don't let anyone know I'm crying.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Exactly. I'm like, "I don't know who's on the opposite side of the door right now at this point." So I was like, "Okay, compose, compose." And then I opened up the door and he walked in. He's like, "Do you want to sit and chat?" And I was just like, "Okay." And so, we closed the door and he's like, "How are you doing?" I said, "I'm fine." And he's like, "No. How are you really doing?" And it was just that moment, where all of a sudden, I just started to cry again, and I couldn't hold back my tears. And we sat for the next 15, 20 minutes and he is such a calm individual, which that then I felt just fell onto me. All of a sudden, the environment was calm. All of a sudden, what I felt was a disaster was no longer a disaster.

Jessica Metcalfe:
So that in and of itself, where he walked in, exuded this calmness, but then also respected the fact that I was extremely emotional and that didn't define me as a dentist, as an individual, or even as a woman in what I was doing. It was, "This is the situation and how are we going to figure out? So then, it doesn't necessarily happen exactly the same way the next time." And I am so very grateful for that encounter because it then set me up for how I want to continue to lead my own team moving forward.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that story. And I think it's so important to talk about... I find there's not a lot of leaders. Thankfully, the ones we talk about on the Best Boss Ever show are, but not a lot that are very good at handling emotion. When somebody's in tears, I notice that a lot of people are really uncomfortable with that.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And I always say, "We're processing anger. That's not sad tears. That's not boohoo." That's like-

Jessica Metcalfe:
Frustration.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yeah. And it is. And I hate that I question myself with it, and it's taken me a while to come to the understanding and just be okay with when I'm experiencing certain emotions, because you're allowed to experience them. You're human at the end of the day. So I have to give myself permission to be like, "Okay, tears well up out of frustration and anger and rage, it's fine. It's just the way that my own body responds." And in that moment, he was accepting of that. And that is exactly what I needed.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Now, when I am placed in situations or even when I see patients who are sitting in front of me and they're sharing their experiences, I look at it from a completely different perspective now.

Christine Laperriere:
So it even made you better with your patients?

Jessica Metcalfe:
100%.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. I never thought about this before, but as a dentist, you have to learn how to be a leader without really having anybody model leadership for you.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell us like, what is that like?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Very interesting, to say the least. So you are kind of thrown into the deep end. In dental school, you're taught how to be a dentist. You're taught all the clinical aspect behind it, all the worst case scenarios that can happen, but you're not taught the management. You're not taught that when you own an office or run multiple offices and there's group practice set up and you have a team manager, you have your front desk staff, you have your dental assistants, hygiene, you have an entire team that you need to run with all different personalities. You don't necessarily know how to be a leader. So you're being thrown into the deep end and it's a sink or swim, but it's also then how you decide, "Okay, am I going to keep evolving? Am I going to keep adapting? Am I only going to focus on the clinical dentistry aspect of it, and then hope the management stuff works out? Or am I going to try to manage the management side as well, and then clinical dentistry will follow along suit with it?"

Jessica Metcalfe:
So it's unfortunate in the sense that especially for dentists, being overachievers or high achievers, type A personalities, perfectionists, when things don't necessarily go right, or there are problems, sometimes we just don't even know what to do from a management perspective, because we've never had to experience this before. And it's not that we haven't worked other jobs. It's just, we don't know what to do in a leadership situation. And that's challenging in and of itself and can take an emotional, mental and physical toll on us.

Christine Laperriere:
As you're saying this, I'm thinking about how many years I've spent obviously working with leaders and doing leadership training and development and you don't just get trained on it and even know what to do. So you're going in cold. And in addition, there's very little for you to model yourself after, or little training. You're not stopping for leadership training in the middle of doing your work. So that's interesting. So tell me a little bit about what was that learning curve like for you as you were stepping into leadership? What did you do right? What did you do wrong?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Well to this day, I think I'm still doing things right and wrong. Which that's the beauty about leadership, is trying to figure out what works best for you. So my biggest takeaway in the leadership that I want to embody is situational leadership because not every individual needs the same leadership skills. Someone may need a little bit more handholding later on. Someone may need a little bit more autonomy. Someone may be just extremely creative. So it's trying to fit them in. "Okay, well where do they then fit within the dental team?" And even within the last eight months, I was thrust into a role that I wasn't expecting. And there was a lot of pressure put on me, right from the get go.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And I remember a situation where... As you can tell, I'm a very energetic, bubbly, happy person, but then there's also the other side of me being the perfectionist. I want things done a certain way. There's a reason why successive procedures get done. The clinic runs efficiently and there's a time and a place for certain things. And we were incorporating a new position into clinic and it just wasn't functioning properly. And I found with the partnership leadership that I was working with, that we weren't communicating properly. And in doing so, I felt like the situation fell to the wayside. What I take away as what I had done wrong is I pulled someone aside and I yelled at them, and I walked away from that situation being like, "I never want to be that person again."

Jessica Metcalfe:
First off I was in the office. I closed the door because I refuse to ever yell at someone in front of a group of individuals because I've had that happen to me as a resident. And that is just uncalled for on all levels. And so, I pulled this person aside, but I'm standing, yelling at her and as it's happening, I'm like, "What am I doing? This is not the leadership that I wanted to become." So I left that situation, and I remember thinking about it for weeks afterwards. And I thought, "Okay, what was the actual situation at hand? Why did I get to that point? How could I have looked at it differently and I need to go apologize to this person," which is exactly what I did. I went, I apologized, I owned my mistake, which that's a huge thing in leadership because we're human, again. We all make mistakes, but you have to make sure you own it.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And I walked away from that being like, "I need to make sure this doesn't ever happen again." So it was a learning experience, that it doesn't matter who or what situation that I'm in next time, just as if I'm walking into a complicated procedure and I take a deep breath and I become focused, I need to do the exact same situation when it comes to managing people's expectations or managing the clinic as a whole. It's taking a deep breath, focus and then walking into the situation instead of just exploding.

Christine Laperriere:
That's such a good example. Well, first of all, cheers to the apology. I was just talking to someone who had a challenge with their boss and there was no apology. And so, once trust is damaged and there's no repair, it's very difficult to move forward, where you went back and did the repair work. So Kudos.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
That's a good step. I'm sure that person appreciated the apology. What wisdom would you give to anybody who has caught themselves yelling at an employee? I heard you say, take a deep breath and focus, but is there any other tools or tips that you use to really kind of bring it down?

Jessica Metcalfe:
First off, I make sure I don't just automatically walk into a situation where I'm fuming, because that's not going to serve anyone and I'm not going to get to a solution at that point in time. So now what I do, I take a step back, I try to examine all the different sides of the story on why potentially that individual did what they did. And so now it's, "Okay, maybe I'm not seeing something that they saw and that's why they acted or reacted the way that they did to the situation." And so, I now ask myself a couple questions and think, "Okay, if I were in the situation, this is how I would respond. But they were in the situation, so we're not two same people. So because of that, they're going to respond differently. So let's go in and ask questions this time."

Jessica Metcalfe:
So instead of me going in with just blanket statements and saying, "You did this wrong. Why did you do this?" And so on and so forth. I go in and I say, "Explain to me why your thought process was the way that it was." So then now it gives me an understanding on, "Well, maybe they weren't actually on the same wavelength as I was, or maybe I explained how to do something inappropriately, or they misinterpreted something." So now there's a miscommunication. So it doesn't mean that they were doing it wrong. They thought that they were doing it right, which in actuality they were, because of the miscommunication. So I think that plays a huge part in taking a step back and taking a deep breath before jumping and fuming is, "Okay, let's actually gather all the facts first before making an assumption or jumping to a conclusion and then recognizing, okay, if there is a miscommunication, how can we go about fixing this? And then what can we do the next time, so then there isn't a miscommunication?" Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Beautiful. I'm sure there's some people out there listening going, "Of course, that makes so much sense." And it's such a good reminder because so many of us in the heat of the moment, that's not our instinct. And so, you've had to rewire that instinct.

Jessica Metcalfe:
The rewiring is exactly, it's hard. It's hard, but it's possible. That's the biggest thing, because I've had to do the same thing with procedures that make me overly anxious. Otherwise, I walk in and your thoughts are just jumbled and I'm not going to be the best dentist that I need to be at that point in time for the patient. So it's rewiring to get more clarity about the situation. And I agree, it's definitely easier said than done, but the more that you do it, it becomes that much easier.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that's such a good answer. Thank you. I have two more questions for you. The first is, when we were on that panel, we had a really meaningful conversation about imposter syndrome. If you had to share with our audience what you've learned and unfortunately, I know this is a side business for you, that you have a lot of content around, but maybe just even from your experience, what have you learned from seeing yourself battle imposter syndrome and maybe some words of wisdom for leaders who are trying to be best bosses? What do they need to watch out for when it comes to that?

Jessica Metcalfe:
I'm going to give an easy definition. It's where self-doubt and the fear failure are so overwhelming that you feel like you're going to be found out. So you underestimate your abilities, you explain away your successes, you don't give yourself enough credit. Self-doubt in and of itself is completely fine. Self-doubt is a way that allows you to rethink what's happening, get you outside of the periphery, shows that you care about what you're learning about. But when it's coupled with potentially self-sabotaging behaviors and it's preventing you from taking the next steps or taking action, then that's where reevaluation is really important, to make sure then you're not stuck.

Jessica Metcalfe:
And so for me, what I found is, I wasn't taking on certain procedures or I wasn't applying for certain roles or getting involved in organized dentistry to the level that I wanted to because of the fact that I didn't think I was good enough. I didn't have enough of the credentials behind me. And one particular time that comes to mind is lecturing. And now, I speak about imposter syndrome and it's empowering others now to then tell themselves that, "I can take these next steps." Okay, yeah, there's a fear there that something may go wrong, but you won't know unless you actually try.

Christine Laperriere:
I guess, I'm thinking too about how many times leaders probably have that moment. I know I work with a lot of them, where they feel like, "What if I get found out? What if I just got this job by luck and my luck's out to run out?" So I definitely can see that. How does that manifest in performance? When you think of, again, we have all these brilliant brains, but for some reason we get this feeling that we're frauds. How does that manifest in performance?

Jessica Metcalfe:
So in performance, especially in business, it can prevent you from applying for a raise or applying for promotion or putting together an idea or presentation because someone else is going to do it better. There's a self sabotaging behavior within the business component, where it prevents you and can keep you very stagnant. And sometimes, all it is, is it starts with a question on you don't even need to be really straightforward with the question. Because I remember when it was for me in particular and I was starting to come out of my shell and I wanted to know if other people were experiencing this, I would go up and be like, "Hey, asking for a friend, so what about this in particular?" They'd be like, "Oh yeah, I feel that all the time." And what I don't think we're talking about enough is the fact that the majority of us still feel this. It's just, we all hide it. And some of us are just really good at hiding it. And that's-

Christine Laperriere:
I know so many of us that feel it.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Right. And so, as long as you take a look at what is happening and you're continually growing and you don't feel like you're not applying for that promotion or the next job or a move or anything that is a really interesting idea that you want to try, but think that you are not good enough for it or that someone else is better or smarter or works harder, you have that capability to be able to do it. It's just going to look different for each one of us.

Christine Laperriere:
I know that you're about to make a big move yourself. First of all, I'd love you to share what was the inspiration behind that. I really appreciated kind of what you shared about that. And then, tell us a little bit about how that maybe your own imposter syndrome might have tied to this and how you kind of had to confront it for your own next move.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Huge move, moving from Toronto, Ontario to Victoria, British Columbia. And I was a general dentist at a cancer center, and two things put everything into perspective. One being COVID, made us rethink. I am a huge planner to begin with, like 15, 20 year plans. And then all of a sudden COVID happened and made us realize that, "Well, we actually really can't plan because we just don't know." Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Jessica Metcalfe:
The second component was my patient population. I kept hearing the same story over and over again, where, "Save all that money, wait for retirement. Once you get there, you're going to have so much fun." And patients would get there and then they would have a diagnosis of cancer. What they kept then reiterating is, "Don't wait. If there's something that you want to do, do it now." No one's going to ever think twice about, "Did I put into that extra hour of work and was it worth it?" No, people are going to look back and be like, "I really wish I spent more time with family, friends, doing those adventures that I wanted to do when I was more physically and mentally well."

Jessica Metcalfe:
And it honestly put so many things into perspective. And that combination for me of my patients in COVID made me rethink and I was stifling my own self. I didn't even realize that a part of me was still stuck in a very old school mentality of once you graduate, you need to become an associate, work five, six days of clinical dentistry, and then the potentially become an owner. But I recognized the fact that I was linking my self worth in my identity to being a dentist, when I had all these other passions and interests that I wanted to explore. And so, I listened to what my patients had to say and decided to make this big move. So I'm scaling back and doing clinical dentistry and exploring all of these other passions that I have now.

Christine Laperriere:
Ah, I have a feeling that I'm going to hear from some people that story just really inspired them. And the best part is we don't know the punchline yet. We don't know how it turns out. Right?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Yeah, totally. And that is the beauty of it, is once you're there, you can figure it out. Give yourself the permission to be able to figure it out because you can. So even though that self-doubt is there, it's okay.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. I think self-doubt, it's a survival technique. But there's also a survival technique which wants us to get out of bed and go live our lives too.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 100%.

Christine Laperriere:
This has been awesome. If there's people that want to follow you and see how your journey unfolds, where should they go check you out?

Jessica Metcalfe:
Two locations. I'm across social media. You can find me under The Alchemist Dentist or you can check out my website at www.drjessicametcalfe.com.

Christine Laperriere:
Beautiful. Jessica, it was fantastic talking to you. I love your energy. I get so-

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
That big, giant smile and I'm feeling like I can do it. So we are all rooting for you. We can't wait to see what unfolds next and thank you again for your time today.

Jessica Metcalfe:
Thank you so much for having me.

Episode: 15
Title: Getting everyone on the bus
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Mary Peterson

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you, Mary, for coming on the show. I really appreciate it.

Mary Peterson:
It's great to be here, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
And I'll say for our listeners sake, I had the opportunity to work with you at Samsung, as we were working to advance some of the high potential women that the organization has. So, it was just neat because I ended up sitting alongside you at an event and we got a chance to talk about how much passion we have for this topic. And since then, I've been a big fan of yours. So I'm thrilled that you took the time.

Mary Peterson:
Well, that's nice of you to say, and yes, I enjoyed working together with you and some of that diversity stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
So, today, of course, I'm going to ask you to talk about your best boss ever. And I know you have lots of thoughts on this one, so I'm going to hand it over.

Mary Peterson:
I mentioned to you already, and I'll say it again, that this was a thought provoking topic for me, because I think oftentimes I get asked to talk about my leadership or leadership, but this is really about my experiences. I look back on the many, many years of my career and who inspired me and what type of boss/people manager inspired me, which is different than the motherhood leadership kind of stuff. So, you got me thinking and I really had to put some time into thinking about this, but I think I've got it. And here's some of it.

Mary Peterson:
I started my career in technology in the mid eighties. This industry's come a long way since then, of course, but it also speaks to the fact that I've always been in an industry that's very fast paced and very innovation driven. And so while other companies, other industries, you might get into a role and keep within your boundaries, I think in technology, we were blasting all over because there was no real path to follow. So, we were charting our own paths in a lot of ways. So, combine that with the fact that young Mary gets on to the scene, very ambitious and very competitive and very ready to take on the world and in this very exciting dynamic industry. And so when I look at back at my best bosses, the ones that inspired me and made me better, it's based on that situation. And I think people management is so situational. And what worked for me, I'll tell you about that may not work for the same analytical, introvert person that maybe isn't quite as ambitious.

Mary Peterson:
So here we go. Okay. The first area that I categorized this in would be those bosses that eliminated fear. So, I have a couple examples of this and what that means really is, we can't create innovation. We can't create change, drive, change, drive results if we are fearful of our jobs of trying new things, et cetera, making mistakes. So, a couple of things. First of all, early career Mary. I'm in one of my first sales jobs and I'm ambitious and I'm darn it I'm going to hit my numbers. I'm going to be an overachiever, I'm going to be the top salesperson. I'm going to beat that darn competitor. And I'm going to go for it. I did my work. I did my prep. I did all of that. And once upon a time, I actually lost a deal. That was a big deal and I lost it. I was devastated, right? So this is early in career. I lost the deal. I thought I was all that. And I was devastated.

Mary Peterson:
I finally got the nerve, went into the office and told my boss that I lost this deal. And he said, "Come into my office." Come into his office, shut the door. And I thought, "Oh no, oh no, I can't believe. I've never been fired from a job. Here it comes, here it comes. How could this be?" And he said, "Okay, let's talk about this. So, did you follow the plan and the process that you've been trained and did you do what you're supposed to do?"... "Yeah, absolutely"... "Did you do the best you could on this deal?"... "Yeah, I put it all out there. I know I did that." He said, "Can you look back and potentially learn something from this?"... "Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about it and there was couple things that maybe I should have done differently."... "Did anyone die?" He said.... "No".

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.

Mary Peterson:
No one died.

Christine Laperriere:
No one died.

Mary Peterson:
He's like, "Okay, good. Get out of my office. Learn from this, pick yourself back up and go win some more deals based on what you learned."

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. I'm smiling from ear to ear because sometimes you don't need to be beat up. You're already beating yourself up enough.

Mary Peterson:
We do it enough to ourselves for sure. And this person was just the first time that I thought, "Oh, okay, chill out a little bit here. We can do this. But we got to learn from it." And I'm sure the conversation would be different the next time, if I made the same mistake, which is also part of this living in fear and making sure you can try things, you can be innovative, but if you make mistake, learn from it and don't do it twice is. That's what I've learned later in my career too. So, even currently at Samsung, where I'm in a leadership position, rolling out new products. Some of these products are out there, it's different, different market, whatever. I'm thinking about one in particular over the last couple of years and it's a different type of product.

Mary Peterson:
So my team and I, we decided, okay, we're going to go try this really different type of distribution channel for it. Seems it makes sense. It's a huge sales force that could represent this product. It's a compatible market that they're in. This could be really something, if this takes off, boom, because the breadth and the scale of this could be incredible. Of course, I've told the executives back at headquarters, all of this that were going after it. Well, we trained them. We set up promotions and incentives. We invested in marketing to support this thing and guess what? It didn't work. It didn't work.

Christine Laperriere:
And what did you learn?

Mary Peterson:
And that's exactly, we learned that they weren't able to push something new into the same stakeholders. They weren't talking to the right person, the market wasn't quite right on with us. There's a list of things that we've gone through to say, "What did we learn from it?" And as long as you do that, we won't do this again. We'll make other mistakes, but we won't do this again. There're even stories if you look back at famous inventors in this world, right? Like how many mistakes did they make before they made that one big invention. The point being, take that knowledge, learn from it and create an environment. So, in my case, I'm in an environment with bosses that allow that to happen. But, I also try to create that environment within my team to don't be afraid. It made sense. It was a great bet. Let's go through it.

Christine Laperriere:
I love hearing that because I've worked with companies where there's zero room for error or there's zero room for a mistake. And to your exact point, it really kills innovation. I can even think of a few that might not come out of the pandemic that well, just from really forcing people to be terrified of innovating, because innovating means you could fail. You will have spent money on something that didn't work. I think you're right. I think this idea around fear, especially in the technology space, the last thing you want is people to be limited in their thinking.

Mary Peterson:
And there are still bosses that do create that. Make that deal at all costs or else... Or okay, you can have that money but, it better work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. They don't want to take a chance on anything.

Mary Peterson:
I've also heard a term 'blame culture' too, which I think is part of that fear, right? You don't want to be the one, "Oh, that was the mistake Mary made" or "Mary made that and now we are all paying for it." You know what I mean? I just think fear and faith is such an important thing that I try to live with always. I can't live with fear.

Christine Laperriere:
So, what other things do you think of when you think of that best boss?

Mary Peterson:
Well, I also think about again, ambitious A type Mary. I was always going for that next thing. So, the way you get it is, you got to prove that you can do it or prove that you're the right person. So, I looked to a couple of bosses that supported me to put myself out there.

Mary Peterson:
So for example, one story in a previous employer where I was working in an area that was slightly different from the main business. So, they asked me to go in and talk to the senior executives, to some key stakeholders about doing this sort of leveraged business model in a very direct sales business world. And to propose that this would be a way for them to grow their business. So my boss came to me and said, "I'd like you to do this. A month from now, we'll book a meeting. We'll get all these people together and we'll present this plan. And again, it's off the side of your desk, because you're still busy doing whatever you have to do, but yeah, I'm all for it. Let's do it."

Mary Peterson:
So, I worked on this thing and I would take it to him and we would review it and get his feedback and we would work on it, work on, work on, and the day came and he says, "So, you're presenting it."... I'm like, "Oh, I thought you were and I would just be in the background."... He's like, "No, this is your plan, your idea, your work, you present it. I'll be in the room if you need me, but you're fine. Right?" And so off I went, little nervous in front of all these important people, but I done the work and I went out there and I pitched this plan and the meeting went well and afterwards the boss came to me and gave me all kinds of props, great job, excellent, et cetera, et cetera.

Mary Peterson:
And then he also told me, "Oh, by the way, so and so in the audience, the senior person, he sent me a text in the middle and saying, Mary is incredible." This is so great, blah, blah, blah and gave me this feedback. And so here I am sitting here, how many years later?, I don't even remember really what I pitched. I don't even really remember how much of it we did. But I remember how that elevated me, that I put myself out there. He gave me the opportunity to put myself out there, to challenge myself, to show everyone, to build my brand. He gave me of the opportunity to do all of that and be successful in a platform. He could have easily taken this and got the props himself. But he gave that to me. And so at the end of the day, I remember so and so that texted him about how awesome I was. I remember the feedback that he gave me. I don't even remember what we really talked about.

Christine Laperriere:
When I listened to that I'm grinning from ear to ear over here because one thing we don't think about is bolstering confidence. So, I hear not only were you given this great opportunity, which you totally deserved, but when you gain confidence in an environment, what you'll do next is even more powerful because you're not limited by your own internal voice of am I good enough? Am I smart enough? All of those things. And so that bolstering of your confidence is phenomenal.

Mary Peterson:
I agree. The layering of your career as you look back in your career and you say what were some of the turning points? And maybe that was a turning point that, "Yes, I can actually do this. And now I have the confidence and I'll do it again more often and it'll be more comfortable." And I think about that out as far as... There's often times and there's often organizations where we don't allow people to broaden their skills. They come in this job and they stay in that job. And when we go to hire something over here, "No, because she's that person, she's not good, she's really good at that." And I think that this example, but also earlier in my career and... I'll tell you Microsoft was really good at this. They would take high performers and move them into lateral roles, move them into different... They're a good salesperson, move them into a marketing role, move them into a services' role. And they would move, especially high performers around, to give them this rounded out. And I don't see that in enough organizations or enough bosses willing to do that.

Mary Peterson:
And one of my other examples about this was, and this is years ago, but I was in an individual contributor role at Microsoft, but it doesn't really matter. I was going on mat leave, which back then was only a six month leave, but I was going on mat leave and they said, "Okay, Mary, I want to give your job away. I want to hire somebody full time for your job because when you come back, I want to find you something better. So, do you trust me that I can go and back fill your job and trust me that I will bring you in at a higher level"... Because of course at that point I'm anxious to be a manager or whatever... "But I'll bring you in at a different role, a different level, and we'll move on from there"... Which again, showed sort of that boss and that environment, was all about creating opportunities to grow and develop and change and not while you're that thing. So we'll keep you in this thing and you will stay in that thing forever.

Christine Laperriere:
Again, like this is another moment where I'm just grinning from ear to ear because the number of women who apologize or feel nervous about leaving for mat leave. I know. I even did it during my first mat leave, I kept apologizing and I was scared of even trying to convince everybody that I could come back at the same level of performance. I wasn't even thinking about growth. I was just thinking, "Please, no, I'm not going to change."

Mary Peterson:
I'll be back. I'll be as keen as I ever was.

Christine Laperriere:
I think of how many people are nervous about when they leave. Will people view them as not being as high performing because they would've had this new life experience and they've been out of the office for six months and "behind", right. And I just think of all of that, that noise, and not only does it come from the outside and then obviously women internalize it. So, I listen to that and I go, "How cool is that?"

Mary Peterson:
And it's funny that if you and I are thinking about this, imagine how subconscious this is in so many places, but yeah, as far as the best boss and being able to create opportunities to develop and grow and challenge and change and lateral moves and all of those things that help us become better.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a really good point, he did not have a bias around maternity leave. As a matter of fact, almost did the exact opposite of what's instinctive. And I think that's kind of cool. You don't hear those stories as often. So, that's an interesting one. And like you said, lots of opportunity for you to grow. I'm sure you came back from mat leave feeling excited.

Mary Peterson:
I was so excited during that break about what the next things were. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Mary Peterson:
So a couple of other best bosses I'll talk about, one is just, again, she was a boss a long time ago, but I think if I look back on somebody that I still to this day and it's been years. I don't even want to say the number, but it's been years since she managed me. But I often think back to how she would handle it because I just thought that she was just the full package. And the main characteristics that bubbled up to me with her was she kept her cool. So, she was calm. She didn't flail, she was calm and cool. I watched her in situations once where a customer/partner treated her very poorly and yelling like it was... It was a really bad scene and she folded her book and walked out of the room. And I thought good for you. Who knows? It's okay if she went to her car and cried, who cares? Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. She had enough dignity to say, I won't be treated like this. Thank you.

Mary Peterson:
So, and then I would see her just in any situation, whether it was customer, with executives, with whatever, it was always that same calm equals confidence personality. Her communication, I still remember, it'd be like, "Okay, you guys come here. I got to talk to you about something, the three of you come here. Here's what we got to do." It was always that keeping us on point, communicating what we needed to know about what was happening in a dynamic environment. She was always good at those little updates, those little things to keep us, "Okay, we need to maybe turn a little bit, but let's keep going." That was another one of her things.

Mary Peterson:
And then building strategies. So, okay, this is the ambitious person being inspired by this. She was managing the business, running the business, but she always had those little side projects that she was working on and you'd talk to her and she'd be like, "Yes. One of the things I'm working on...", There was always a problem solving piece that she was working on. So it wasn't a matter of somebody come to her and say, "Okay, time now to figure out X, Y, and Z". It was more like she saw situations that could be improved or fixed. And then she was always kind of working on them. And the next thing you know, they'd bubble up and we'd be executing them, but you know what I mean?

Mary Peterson:
And so this is somebody that I still go back to, "Okay, what would she have done?" This is steady base and maybe that's what I needed. I needed the steady rock. I needed this rock to drive our business and lead our business while I was doing what I do. So, I think that was part of it too, to be that rock. She was that rock for me.

Christine Laperriere:
It's an interesting one because having done these interviews, that calm leader paired up with a very ambitious, maybe emotionally tied passionate person seems to be an interesting combination that I've now heard quite a few times where it's like, there's that leader that is the steady, just like you said the rock and keeps everybody like, "Hey, no one died. It's all good. Everything's going to work [inaudible 00:17:05]." And then meanwhile, you have this passionate high energy, high potential employee and they get to come in and be all those things, but balanced with that, calm, steady.

Mary Peterson:
Yeah. It's a good point. And now that I'm a leader, I have to remind myself of that because I know where I revert back to. I know I'm more emotional person and I need to remind myself of that sometimes. And I need to remind myself to be that rock for others. And I also have to remind myself that when I'm with another me, that we can spin each other out of control. So that's when I know when I'm with other 'mes', I need to be the rock.

Christine Laperriere:
The rock. Exactly.

Mary Peterson:
I have to get back to the rock at some point.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. Someone in the room has to be the rock. But I also love this proactive problem solving that she was doing off the side of her desk. And one thing I work with a lot of leaders who sometimes feel burnt out or they feel like they're not being used for their highest purpose, right? So managing a small team or rallying a small team is enjoyable, but when you've done it for a long time, it starts to lose some of its oomph. And so, I hear that proactive problem solving, I think that's a good example of a leader finding a way for her to stay motivated, like for her to stay inspired on the job.

Mary Peterson:
That might have been it, or it might have been the way she's going to be recognized and get ahead or could just be solve problems to solve. I'm not sure it was about keeping yourself busy in those days because it was kind of a crazy times, but still.

Christine Laperriere:
But given lots of energy and excitement sometimes around all those problem solving. So, that's cool. Those are fantastic stories.

Mary Peterson:
Well, I have one more and actually this one's on the same thing. It was the same company, different boss, also female, also calm and the rock. And I guess maybe that's what I gravitated to as far as strong leadership, especially when I was younger, but this boss had just the incredible ability to build strategy through and with the team. So, she was all about driving change, change leadership, doing new things, but she had this incredible ability to get everyone involved in building this. And I still think about it, some days I wish I could do this, but this ability to get a group of people together, start with the brainstorming, pick those key areas, start to move us forward, revisit it every couple of weeks with a group of people and be able to get to an incredibly great strategy and execution and drive some incredible change within the organization.

Mary Peterson:
And of course, if everyone's got their blood, sweat and tears in it, we're already bought in and it's going to happen. And there are times where it would be easier to go off and set this yourself than come to the team and execute together. But she had such an incredible job of building it with the others and then you've got the buy in and next thing you know, you're executing and her analogy she always used was getting on the bus. So, the process of getting, and I'm sure this is used by a lot of people, she probably didn't invent this, but I still, you use this all the time [inaudible 00:20:12] right. Just getting everyone on the bus, get them on the bus, then you're going to decide who's driving. Where are you sitting? How are you doing? Where are you going?

Mary Peterson:
Like we all are on the bus and we're figuring that out. And then we set the vision and we take off down the road. And there are times when some people are going to fall off the bus and we have to circle back up and pick them up because they didn't buy in. They don't agree. There're some problems we've encountered that we have to do it, but it's about setting the vision, sharing the vision, rules and responsibilities. Who's driving the bus, who's packing the bus, who's making sure there's gas in the bus. All of those things, rules and responsibility, so important to setting that up and then tracking the results. What's the map. Are we getting close to the right destination? Have we veered off course? Is everyone still on the bus? So, she would use that all the time, but she just had such a great ability to pull us all together and make this happen.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the analogy. We've heard the term, but actually it sounds even... it was used even more thoughtfully around strategy. It wasn't sometimes it's the cultural bust, but I'm hearing that it was also really used to the extent where we're trying to get to a destination and we're going to keep talking about it, right. And I think sometimes those models, when you think of how people's brains interpret information, would be so helpful, because not everybody has a strategic brain. And so I hear this sometimes where it's hard to get everybody aligned on strategy. This sounds like it was built for everybody to be included.

Mary Peterson:
She was incredible at doing that and pulling a lot of people together. The joke is, and I still stay in touch with her to this day, it'd be like, she's the friend you want to come over when you have to move your house or something too. Right? She pull it all together and get it done.

Christine Laperriere:
So, she would obviously bring everybody into the room and get them working on the strategy. But tell me even any specific tactics you saw her do that made it possible because I see leaders run sessions and they dominate the whole session.

Mary Peterson:
No, she would do it at the... She's very methodical, but she would get us in the room. I remember several examples. One time we were at her cottage and oftentimes it would be... You don't realize it's a burning platform yet. She's found this burning platform, so she's getting us all involved. So it's about brainstorming and what's important to pull forward. And then we take that or we take the three things that we pulled out of that. And then we go two weeks from now, the next degree together as a team, getting through. And along the way, there might be some takeaway or some follow up. But it's not everyone, "Okay, one to 10, everyone take a topic and come back and report to me." No, it would be if there's a subject matter expert that would take that off, otherwise no, it was... And oftentimes she would do a lot of the... "Okay, pulling it together to make it easier for us kind of thing."

Christine Laperriere:
Sounds like she has that ability to facilitate the conversation and make sure people feel included and then the strategic vision as well. So she knows where she's trying to get everybody in that session.

Mary Peterson:
And brain platform was also one of her taglines too. So it was like, we all needed to believe in this brain platform along the way too, which was part of keeping people on the bus. If you didn't believe on it, then let's go back. Let's circle around. What could we do to address this differently? Is this something we want to fix and change or build.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's a great example of getting strategic alignment and ownership. It's such a perfect example of that. I see so many leaders who set the strategy and then they talk, talk, talk it down into their team. Not that there's anything necessarily. That's the traditional way that it's done. But what I'm hearing here is she's not leaving the station unless everybody's on the bus.

Mary Peterson:
Exactly and so we were all on. So, by the time we were bringing this to mainstream, we all believed in it. We were all passionate about it. We'd all put our blood, sweat and tears into it. And we were going to make this happen versus the change that comes from above and is handed to you, sometimes doesn't... It takes more revs to get everyone bought in.

Christine Laperriere:
And we already know if you're not fully bought in, even if you're partially bought in, we don't put our blood, sweat and tears in the same way. So, if I signed up to get on that bus, I'm going to feel much different about the journey than if I got pushed into getting on the bus.

Mary Peterson:
Even if you're on the bus and you're not really sure where it's going, as long as you're there for the journey, even if you jump out then, "Well, okay, there's something wrong. Christine jumped out of the bus. Let's figure out why."

Christine Laperriere:
It's such a good a story. And it's really making me think a lot about the leaders that I work with who have important strategic outcomes they're trying to accomplish. And maybe the ways that they could approach that. Well, Mary, knowing that most of the listeners here are either ambitious types that are on their way to management. Or we have some folks that are in management who are ambitiously working to be amazing leaders. They're not settling for less. What would be any last words of wisdom or nuggets that you think could really help that audience along?

Mary Peterson:
I think going back to the things that I started with, first of all, I don't know, I call it faith, not fear or you can't live in fear. So, if you're in a situation where you're being forced to be in fear, there's something wrong with that. And that needs to be addressed either it's in you and your confidence and your ability to do something or it's being pressure put on you. And nothing good happens from that. We need to be confident and faithful, but I always think faith, not fear... We need to know that we can do this and we'll be all right. And nobody dies and nobody loses their job. And as long as you only do it once, make a mistake, break glass, try things, be curious, that's all part of this faith, not fear piece. Be curious, try new things, don't be fearful or you won't ever push the limits.

Title: Going on a mission to Mars
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Jaime Moody

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the boss that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So, welcome, Jamie. Thank you so much for being on the show.

Jaime Moody:
Oh, it's great to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm so thrilled that you are on this show. When I think of really great guests to bring on, I love to go back and reflect on leaders that I've known throughout my career, and we got a chance to know each other through CEO Global as you were CEO of Tree of Life, and what I really admired was how many people respected and admired you. So, out of that group of a hundred CEOs and leaders, you were definitely one of the most admired leaders in that group. And so, for me, when I ask the question who's your best boss ever, I feel like I go after the ones who are already admired by their peers in that way.

Jaime Moody:
It's nice of you to say. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Do you want to do any other introduction just to get us started?

Jaime Moody:
Tree of Life has been my passion for these last 23 years, having been the president for about 18 of those years and now as vice chair, I'm just on the board and an advisor to the business, and having just hired a new president to take over and working with her. Her name is Lisa MacNeil and she is doing fabulous. Love having her on the team.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. That is excellent. So, then just diving in, I want to know who is your best boss ever, and why?

Jaime Moody:
I really come up with a lot of folks over the years, quite frankly, but there's two that really stand out, and it's been my most recent experience of these folks that I work with and for very different reasons. One was when I first came into this company and I just had someone I worked with and I came in sort of as a second in command, if you will, CFO, and the person I work with at the time had hired me. He just had an all-around knowledge of the business and was just so knowledgeable in just every facet of the business, and I just like the fact that you could take any sort of issue to him and have a discussion about it, and he would weigh in and not tell you what to do, of course, but he would weigh in and give you some things to think about. He very much let me do what I did and stayed out of my way.

Jaime Moody:
That's been mostly true in my career as I worked for people sort of let me do what I do and pretty much stayed out of my way or else I wouldn't have stayed, right, because that is the old adage, right? You don't quit a company. You quit the boss. That's almost always true, but you really just quit people who don't let you do what you do. And so, I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of people who let me do what I do. It's been fun.

Christine Laperriere:
So, when you think of that first boss that you had though, who it sounds like he was a mentor probably in some ways or his style was very mentoring, what happens if you were on the wrong track or if you were headed down the wrong path. How did he help bring you back?

Jaime Moody:
Frankly, he was just very direct, right? He just said, "We're off course here and we just need to get it back on course." Ultimately, there wasn't a lot of that, to be honest, in this particular situation. It just seemed to be a business that fit well with me and I fit well there and we were just able to achieve some good things, but that's the point. That's what mentorship's about is helping you setting out guidelines. I've always been a strong believer in setting goals and have alignment against goals and then being very pragmatic about how we cascade those goals within the organization and making sure there's no room for error or misjudgment. So, there's a lot of communication that has to go out along that way, and so he was good at that. We knew what we needed to accomplish together and what we needed to accomplish individually. So, it made for a good, healthy environment.

Christine Laperriere:
Did you find that you also got autonomy on how you worked and when you worked and some of those things once you had really good alignment on the outcome?

Jaime Moody:
Almost always had that, and that's a great part too. I've almost always had. I guess it's a part of I get to work when I want. Well, I worked a lot, so I guess that's when I wanted to. When you fill the day with work, and I always remember those feelings, when you're driving home from the office and it might be eight o'clock at night and you reflect back on what you've accomplished in the day, you feel good about it. I always good about that. I felt like I got a lot done and I would go back in the next day energized. So, that was a good thing.

Christine Laperriere:
And then who was that second boss that crossed your mind?

Jaime Moody:
Well, and that is the boss that worked [inaudible 00:04:31. Now, this gentleman runs an organization that has many billions of dollars. He's based in the US. 5,000 employees, et cetera, something like that. What really struck me was when they come in and bought our business and they bought it many, many years ago now, I remember having the first conversation with him just before they closed on the transaction. He came up to Toronto and we got together. He and the CFO of the organization came up. We met for dinner and drinks first, and as would be my norm, I start talking about the business, my love, my passion, and he said, "Well," he said, "I know about the business or at least I know enough today about the business. What I don't know is who you are, and what I really want to know is get to know you as a person."

Jaime Moody:
And that has always stayed with me since that day, right? It is about let's know each other as individuals. Let's know each other as people first, and then honor and respect everything that we are as people. The business is a part of who we are and what we do, of course, but first it's about who we are as people. What a delightful conversation it was.

Christine Laperriere:
Such a great point. So, as he's gotten to know you as a person, how does that shape how he works with you?

Jaime Moody:
I would have him come up to our annual sales and marketing meetings, and we give him a half an hour to talk to folks that people always want to know how it's going in the mothership and how the US is doing, and at the end of his address, he would always turn to me and he would say, "And Jamie, keep writing those checks." Right? Not that we ever sent them a check, but the reality is we were doing good things to the organization and the business was successful, and that's the way he just wanted to close his discussion with a little humor, obvious appreciation for what we do as an organization.

Jaime Moody:
Frankly, in the end, for the most part, I was not reporting to him, I was reporting to the CFO because when they bought the business, they really bought the business of our US parent company, and Canada was not an afterthought, but a throw in, was not strategic to their intent. But six months after the deal, he had me come down and speak to the board of directors and talk to the board about who we are and what we are and what our future prospects are. At that point, we were no longer for sale. As he said to me, he said, "Now that we've fallen in love with your business and we understand it better, and maybe you should report to me." And I said, "No, no. I like reporting to the CFO. He's a great guy. We're both learning from each other. He wants to do deals. I want to do deals." And so, we stayed that way. Since then, this fellow and I have become very close friends. We've done many vacations together. When we're away in vacation, we almost never talk business, but we know each other as people for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. It's such a good example though. Sometimes when I'm working with leaders, like you said, they jump to the business conversation first. We always want to be really efficient and really purposeful about time. I find that by nature we always jump in and talk shop right away, and I think it's interesting that he slowed you down and he prioritized getting to know you, almost with the assumption that if he got to know you, he'd be able to do business with you better.

Jaime Moody:
Absolutely. Absolutely right. And so, I've really tried to learn from that. I'm not good at it all the time. I sometimes get it right, but I always in the end find out more about people. This is not just some person who just shows up at your office every day. These are people who spend most of their waking hours with you, and so that's why I've always looked at that and said, "Let's build a family culture in the organization so that it becomes a fun place to come to." I've always enjoyed when I hear laughing in the outside or in the office or wherever, and I will sometimes in my management, my walking around, wander in to a group that's having some fun and I will have a laugh with them and just look at them and say, "Okay, permission to have fun."

Christine Laperriere:
Permission to have fun. This is kind of a nice segue. I'm curious, tell me a little bit more about the culture you created because I think people listening are going, "Oh, family culture? We're allowed to have fun?" Tell me more about that.

Jaime Moody:
It's really about purpose. We set out some years ago, maybe 11, 12 years ago, to create our own culture if you will, create a culture that was purposeful to what we could be or should be as opposed to that which just simply exists. So, we wanted to be a little bit of our own design, and I really wanted to be a values-based, performance-based culture. I think we had that, but they weren't well enunciated, and we have a quarterly meeting though, where we talk to all of our new folks. I used to fly across the country to do this with all our places across the country, but now it's easier because we do it virtually. But every quarter, we would sit and talk to everybody who's joined the organization last quarter and I would explain where the values came from.

Jaime Moody:
So, our purpose at Tree of Life is helping Canada eat well and live well, and it's a purpose that allows us to say what we do in terms of bringing great foods to Canadians. People are engaged by the culture. They understand it but that's not enough. I wanted to be values-based as well. So, we did an exercise. It's from Jim Collins back when he was, 1996, he wrote an article in Harvard Business Review how to bring values and purpose into your culture, and in there he described something called the mission of Mars.

Jaime Moody:
And the mission of Mars is something where you bring your people together and say, "Okay, here's the deal. I want you to think about this. We're going to have some people from Tree of Life go to Mars, and I want you to select who's going to go. Now, understand that it's not about that they speak Martian or that Martians speak English. We're just going to get to know each other through our observation and look at how we interact, right, and that we're just going to learn from each other. So, who do you want to send on that trip?" Pretty simple concept, right? And I said, "Bring three names."

Jaime Moody:
So, at the end, our management team got together. We had a two-day off-site. I think there was over 51 names on the board, but there was five names on the board that came up again and again. The discussion then turned. Well, let's brainstorm. Let's do some word mapping around why you picked these people, right, why these people were picked and what it is about them.

Jaime Moody:
And so, out of that came our values and our values are courage, accountability, improvement, balance, and excellence. They've been with us a long time, but that's what came out. We were able to put descriptors around what those words were. One day, our CEO said to me, he said, "Jamie, why is it that your values in Canada are different from those in the US?" And I said, "Well, because ours are made in Canada and they're from us. They're people. Right? They reflect who we are." He said, "Oh," because he thought maybe that our values should be the same as theirs, and I said, "Yeah." But he respects the fact that Canada is a distinct culture from the US, and he asked me how we process we did. So, they did the same thing in the US. They took a mission to Mars.

Christine Laperriere:
Did they come up with any similar values or were they completely unique?

Jaime Moody:
No, they're very similar. Quite frankly, our parent company is faith founded. Their purpose is serving and honoring God in everything we do. It's really about the golden rule of how we treat people. That's the commonality, if you will, as I interpret it. They have similar values around being humble, respectful, integrity. We tithe 10% of our earnings to help the less fortunate. So, that's how we honor our values. But people really get engaged I think by the fact that we have values. They really do drive what we do every day as a business, and our purpose certainly does that. Having a boss who allows you to do that is a very good thing. Bringing people along for the ride, when you do that is very engaging.

Christine Laperriere:
It's so interesting, and then I'm curious. So, when you see somebody in the organization that is not aligned to those values, help me understand what is it like to work in a very values-based organization, especially if somebody doesn't quite fit that mold.

Jaime Moody:
You have to make them real. Strategy is simple. Execution is difficult, right? This is just our strategy. We wanted to be purpose-driven and we wanted to be values-based. So, the execution of that is something that just means you got to live in every day. So, if you've got people that are offside, you bring them to the game. I always take the opposite view of things. There's an old adage in business, HR philosophy from years and years ago that you should treat everybody the same. I've never believed that. I think you should treat everybody great. And great to you and great to me are likely going to be two different things, right? So, people interpret these things differently, but what we tried to do is we've created awards, call them the LOV Awards, living our values. Every month we talk about people who are living our values. Every month we would talk about is there a situation that's risen in the last period that you've heard we are not living our values, and those are fruitful discussions. They don't come up often, but when they do, they're great discussions.

Christine Laperriere:
When are things in conflict with those values most often? I'm just curious. When do you notice there's actually sometimes a conflict with the values?

Jaime Moody:
Not very often do you think that you find things that are in conflict with the values. I've never believed in mission statements. I think they're worthless. They're usually just words that say, "We're going to be the best." Well, that doesn't tell you how you're going to be the best. I've always loved these statements that FedEx has, for example, is 9:00 AM next day guaranteed. Right? Simple. Everybody understands what it is. Everybody's job is that. Right?

Jaime Moody:
Helping Canada eat well and live well is our purpose statement. I put a goal statement to that, and I call them Jamie's forever goals, likely because we'll never get there, but we should forever be pursuing them. And I always make a joke about that, they're forever goals because just for that reason, but they are that we want this to be the best place to work, and we want every customer and client experience to be a great experience. It just rolls out off the tongue, and that comes back to me all the time when I was running the business. But if we're going to make this the best place to work, then what about this? If we're going to make that a great client experience or a customer experience, what about this?

Christine Laperriere:
That resonates with me. Right off the bat, I'm thinking to myself how much that would shape the way you make decisions every day. Those tiny, little micro-decisions, you can always bounce it off of a forever goal.

Jaime Moody:
The hardest value that we have is called work-life balance. My definition of work-life balance is understandably different from someone else's, and as people deal with that, they say, "You're not living up to your balance statement. You're not living to that value." Right? And I said, "You're right." It's the hardest thing to deal with, as I say. It's different for everybody. But just think about it this way. If that wasn't one of our values, how bad do you think it would be? It makes us think about it. It's driven our benefit plans. It's driven some of the flexibility we have around our work schedule. It's driven the fact that we are a family. We get that, and if there's a sick child at home, please deal with it.

Christine Laperriere:
I've actually coined the phrase work-life wisdom because I call it, it's custom for each one of us. So, my wisdom is exiting at 5:30 so I can spend quality time with my three and five-year-old. But your wisdom may be different. You know what I mean? You might choose to have dinner at seven o'clock at night, or make sure that you get time with the cats. It can be a very different version of what your wisdom is that tells you what you need to stay resilient.

Jaime Moody:
That's exactly right and that's precisely the point. If you want people to be engaged in what you do every day, you have to treat them as humans. You have to give them some flexibility, right? You have to treat them in the way you'd like to be treated.

Christine Laperriere:
It is amazing how these all sound so simple, but in reality, for some reason, they're not. I'm talking to a leader today whose boss wants her in the office at 7:00 AM working on something that he believes is time sensitive, and it's just so interesting when I think of how many leaders have lost sight of that, that it sounds obvious, but it's not.

Jaime Moody:
Yeah, and the way I've always dealt with that is to think about there's always things you need to get done. You have to have a performance culture. One of the best ways to drive performance is by putting milestones and deadlines in place. The times when you are the most productive ever is the week before vacation, or when you have a deadline. Just sometimes I would put artificial deadlines in place. Yes, I want to get things done, and I would always ask a person, "When do you think you can have that done by?" I may be thinking three weeks is great. They are almost inevitably going to say something less than three weeks, and we end up something in between probably. So, allowing people to set their own deadlines, which is what my bosses have done for me, right, has been a great learning experience for me. It will get done. It will get done in that timeframe, and it will get done right.

Christine Laperriere:
So, tell me about your worst boss.

Jaime Moody:
I haven't had a lot of them, for one, but I guess I should call it the guy who fired me as my worst boss. I was working for a company that, well, it was one of those companies when you walk in, it was too good to be true. When I looked at the financial statements, all it was good, but when I actually got inside the doors, I saw that they were basically insolvent. The good news is we figured out a way to get us out of that situation, and I was a big part of why that got figured out, I would say. But one, day he came into my office and he fired me on the spot and he didn't tell me why, and I had really no idea why. I found out later that some people had positioned me as that I should be taking over the business, and it was his private business. I mean, it was never even in the scope of my mind that I would do that.

Jaime Moody:
So, in the end, it wasn't a great experience, but through the process, spent about two years there. We took a business that was basically insolvent and turned it around and got it fixed and put it in a good place. And if there's ever a way that for young people, as they're starting in their career and they're in a crisis situation learning how to sail a ship when the ship is on fire is a great experience. It's not fun while you're there, but it's a great learning experience, and it is the baptism on fire.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is an excellent piece of wisdom right there too. I think of different situations that I've been in where it's extremely challenging. To your point, they're the biggest education.

Jaime Moody:
Anybody can sell a ship in smooth seas as they often say.

Christine Laperriere:
So, knowing that this show gets a lot of listens from people who are entering into leadership, are currently in leadership and/or ones who are trying to be better leaders, just share with me kind of... I think you probably have hours of words of wisdom, but as many things as you can that they need to hear right now.

Jaime Moody:
Well, the best leaders I've worked for there has been a common bound and that's been that they love to learn, and they want you to learn. As you think about your career, as we talked a little bit earlier about being purposeful about your career, part of being purposeful is making sure that you're learning everything you can along the way, right? That's going to prepare you for your next role, whether it's in the current organization or whether it's outside the current organization, but as long as you're learning every piece, then you're in a good place.

Jaime Moody:
And look for a boss who is a lifelong learner, and that's how you're going to be able to lead people and have a successful career, by learning as much as you can along the way. Being part of the CEO Global network as you and I were, it's just a hot bed for learning. It's what we do, right? We help each other, and with problems that we have that are often a similar but different problem that we have each other, the perspectives you get from being able to talk to other people about it and the learning you get from that is just fantastic.

Jaime Moody:
So, that is the other thing for a young leader. Get a mentor. Get somebody you can speak to and maybe in the same organization, but perhaps not. I've done some mentoring of some people from other organizations, and I've learned a lot from them as well. I love mentoring a younger person because how much do I learn from a younger person, right? It's fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
Keeps your mindset valuable and flexible too, right?

Jaime Moody:
Precisely. The thoughts of a younger consumer are quite a bit different from where I'm thinking, not to mention the challenges we have around technology and how much fun we have with that. I quite enjoy technology and bound and determine not to be a dinosaur because I love this stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
But I bet that mentoring of youth, again, you have so much wisdom to share. They're keeping you young and thinking about different age groups and the way different brains operate. So, that's kind of a win-win for everybody.

Jaime Moody:
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, Jamie, thank you so much. Like I said, I'd love to pick your brain for hours. Maybe we'll have to have you on again. So, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Jaime Moody:
Been great, Christine. Very nice talking to you.

Title: Leaving a legacy
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Suzanne Roy

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome to the Best Boss Ever. And today I have Suzanne Roy on with me from McCormick. Suzanne, hello.

Suzanne Roy:
Hi there, Christine. Great to see you. Thank you for having me on the show.

Christine Laperriere:
I've had the luxury of working with you for over 10 years now and watching you as a leader just bloom through the years. So it's a really special thing to get a chance to have this conversation today. And I also know who one of the best bosses ever that you've worked for is. I have a massive, massive amount of respect for her, so I couldn't help but bring this topic forward today. So, Suzanne, please introduce yourself first.

Suzanne Roy:
Hi everybody. My name is Suzanne Roy and I'm the Vice President of Sales and Marketing for McCormick & Company. And I am based at headquarters in Maryland in the US.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. I know today's topic's going to be a bit emotional, but can you tell us who your best boss ever is?

Suzanne Roy:
Actually I can, and I have to say this is a real honor. So my best boss ever was Megan Ford, who actually was my boss for almost the last, I would say, eight years. Unfortunately, we lost Megan a couple of months ago. So this just means the world to be able to honor and kind of remember why we were all so attached, actually so inspired by her leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. Can you tell me some of the great qualities of Megan?

Suzanne Roy:
Absolutely. I remember the first time I met Megan, there was an ease about her. Although she was a woman leader and an important leader for our organization and she could have been intimidating, but she just wasn't. She had this warmth about her. She had this inviting nature about her. And I think the thing for me that marked me the most over the years was her generosity of herself and her time. And that just allowed her to have an impact so much broader than what many leaders will have a chance to have in their career.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's amazing when you talk about her, those qualities strike me because in my time working with McCormick, I had just a few interactions with her, but that was exactly the impression. It was like, she was just so generous and she's so senior then. I was always very intimidated when I walked in the door. And then within a couple seconds, I'd calm right down.

Suzanne Roy:
Yep. That describes Megan.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Can you tell us some more examples and qualities, things you've grown to admire in her?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah, I think... And again, I mean, I had the pleasure of seeing Megan also grow as a leader throughout her career. So from a Vice President to really stepping out of our business for a period of time and then really being the first woman President of our US business. What I really saw was that Megan, over the years, just grew in confidence and in presence. She found the way to simplify the way that she talked about our business. And when you think about the B2B business that she led in a pretty large CPG company, her ability to simplify, teach and attract talent because of the passion that she had for it. She just had a way of being able to demystify and simplify to the easiest denominator for people to be able to grasp what our business was really about and how it was different.

Christine Laperriere:
She could distill it down to the simplest terms, help bring people on board?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah. And she could. I mean, we talk a lot about storytelling, but I think she had a way of giving you examples that were both easy to understand, but very, very relatable, which I think just, again, just allowed for us to get much better oversight.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of a specific time when you were talking to her about something tough and how she guided you through that?

Suzanne Roy:
I mean, over the years, every business goes through its challenges. And when we face some really hard times, sometimes where we didn't necessarily have our entire business being as efficient and as effective and have the optimal service agenda and really deliverables. And she would have a way of allowing you to realize that everything was about the journey. She would walk you through the fact that this was a marathon in order to really transform and make progress that things need to be done in stages. And that you needed to have patience because that is the way that you had the ability to really get traction. And I think she allowed you the opportunity to express your frustration, but she also gave you the opportunity to walk out of a conversation feeling more confident and reminding you of why she was confident that we would be in a position to make progress. And you always, at least I have to say for me personally, I always walked out of a conversation feeling more uplifted than I did when I walked in. And to me, that's an incredible trait for a leader.

Christine Laperriere:
That is an incredible trait when I think of a best boss, the ability to uplift people when they feel stuck or they feel frustrated or they feel impatient. All of those feelings can become quite toxic if nobody actually leads in that moment. Right?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah, absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm just kind of curious, when you think of leadership and what you've seen, what's the impact of having a best boss in a role like that? People question, what does that do to the bottom line? How does that impact the results?

Suzanne Roy:
A lot of companies talk about engagement and how engaged employees will drive a higher level of efficiency. And I would even say of performance. And I think having a best boss does that. But it does it in a way that allows you to remember the people aspect of leadership and not just the results that are expected of a leader. And I think Megan had just a remarkable balance between those two. You never felt as if the performance would come ahead of the people. And I think that made you want to work even harder on her behalf and wanted you to kind of follow her because of the passion that she had and her ability to maneuver the balance of people and performance.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, if you were to just kind of summarize. I know that there's some incredible work that you're doing on the behalf of marking her legacy. Can you just tell us a little bit about that?

Suzanne Roy:
I think what marked me the most when Megan was recognized at her funeral was actually her husband who asked everybody to pay it forward. And for me, that really made an impression on me. And I have to say there is not an interaction at work today where I don't think of whether or not I have left the person that I've just interacted with in a better or a worse place. And if I have the ability of getting people to feel better after an interaction, to me, that is the best recognition of just the sheer aura that she had the ability to have over this organization and her team. And it allows me to make sure that I keep part of her.

Suzanne Roy:
The other thing, for me, that I continue to think about when I'm in situations that are probably challenging is I take a step back, and this might sound really cliché, but I think about what would Megan do. And it often helps me affirm what my intuition is, because it's not always easy, especially when you're being tested in new roles and so on. But for me, it gives me the confidence to take a step back and just kind of use that as a benchmark. Not that I'm trying to emulate, but I sure want to have the opportunity to be able to inspire and make sure that this has not happened in vain. And that, for me, is important.

Christine Laperriere:
And I mean, one thing I'll just say kind of given that I knew her as well, she was taken too soon and we all agree with that. And it was very surprising. I feel like the first thought I had is what do you want people to say if something like that happens? If you're gone tomorrow, what do you want people to say about you? And I feel like everybody, what they say about Megan is just so beautiful that I think to myself, what a life well lived. If that's the impact that you left, how beautiful is that?

Suzanne Roy:
What I think is the other amazing thing is at any point you can look her around at least her segment and you can see the people that she brought over to our part of the business. And this was not, again, I mean, Flavor Solutions was not always the place where everybody wanted to migrate to. But I think the passion that she had and exuded and expressed for it, we can look around the room and wink and know and nudge that we were selected by her to be part of her group. And that, for me, is a legacy that is incredible. And she continues to bring people together, although she's not necessarily doing it with us on a day-to-day basis, which I think is an incredible memory about what she did so well.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. I know that this shaped you, this experience shaped you. If you were going to bring on a brand new leader and start to mentor them and take what you've learned from this experience and try to integrate it into the way that you mentor or help bring up future leaders. What are some of the things that you would tell them, or what's some of the pieces of wisdom that you would suggest?

Suzanne Roy:
Never let performance come ahead of the people, would be one of them. If you had good news or bad news, would you want to be the kind of person that you would want to share it with? And I think the ability for people to know that they can do it in either situations, I think is really important for new bosses and new leaders. I would say, be mindful of whether or not you build confidence and build trust and build credibility in the people that you engage with. Because I feel like as a leader, you do that through transparency and honesty, but you also do that with allowing people the freedom and the opportunity to prove themselves. And I think it's such an important trait for a leader to make sure that people feel uplifted and stronger because they know that they have your support. To me, these would be the three things that I think really have changed the way that I think about leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
It sounds like she didn't need to use status to gain respect.

Suzanne Roy:
No, never. The other part for me was consistency. Consistency and availability, I think are two other attributes that I think are really important. I think consistency was no matter who she engaged with, she was always consistent. She was always authentic. And you could see that whether she was engaging with interns that were coming into our company, or whether she was engaging with the CEO of a company or the CEO of her own company, she was very consistent. And, again, I think that builds trust and credibility. I think that is one of the most endearing and important attributes, especially for people that are customer facing. I think that was the other element.

Suzanne Roy:
And I think the generosity aspect of her time made it that if she thought that you needed her, she never made you feel like it was after hours. She never made you feel like it was before hours. She just, again, had this generosity of her time that despite how busy she was, you always knew that if you needed to get ahold of her, you could. What I also loved about Megan's demeanor was Megan was not high maintenance. In its simplest form, someone that could just go with whatever. And I think, especially as younger talent and new leader, you're already stressed enough trying to do what you need to do. And of course you continuously try to please and make an impression on your boss. She just allowed you to not have that pressure.

Suzanne Roy:
And I had another boss who had also that kind of demeanor, where it was just kind of a listen, these things happen or we'd be traveling together. She would not be the one that would be sitting in a different spot. She would actually be the one that would be in the back of the plane and nothing was a big deal. And that, to me, spoke a lot about the demeanor with which she did business. And I think as a boss, it kind of went completely against so many stereotypes we've got about what bosses are like. And I absolutely love that. And, again, for me, it made an impression on me without a doubt.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that. That is so good. That is so good. That's such a good point. And you brought up the idea of how she contradicted stereotypes of bosses. That makes an impact on me.

Suzanne Roy:
I think that the other piece, the difference that I also saw was this love to win. I mean, there's no question about it. She had a love to win. I mean, failure was not an option and that was in our business and that was with our customers. But it never came at the expense or in a way that made you feel like that was more important than anything else. And I think that, again, was just a really good example of how you can win, but it doesn't have to come at the expense of anything.

Christine Laperriere:
She liked to win when it was a win for everyone.

Suzanne Roy:
She loved to win. She was a master negotiator like no other. And she did it in a way that left both parties just feeling really good. And, again, it may sound like don't get me wrong, Megan grew into that role in a way that just made such an impression. And for me, those are the things that have honestly made a difference in the way that I lead and the way that I interact with people today. That's my honor to her.

Christine Laperriere:
Hearing about this gave me a lot of pause because of how many years I've heard people speak. I've coached everybody that worked for her and the way people talk about their bosses or their boss's bosses, it tells you so much about a person. So even though I didn't interact with her often, there was so much that I gathered just from the way people talked about her candidly behind the scenes. And so I had a massive amount of respect for her. People don't come into a coaching conversation and speak candidly and still say very respectful things that their bosses and their boss's bosses.

Suzanne Roy:
And you know what? She was good, but she worked at it. Again, let's not kid ourselves. This was not an easy... It's not as if everything came necessarily without work. I think she naturally had an ability to engage with people and to be generous with her time. And that was very important to her. But I mean, she worked at it and she worked at it constantly and continuously. And I think, again, that says a lot about how she progressed as a leader through the organization. And I still remember my first and my last interaction with her. That's just the journey that she did that I always paid attention to.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you tell us about the first and the last interaction?

Suzanne Roy:
Yeah, the first interaction I was still in Canada. She was leading one of our largest customers and she was actually battling her first round of breast cancer. And she had this beautiful silk scarf on her head. And, again, this generosity of time. She just gave me the advice as I was starting to interact with the US group about kind of what to think about. And she took the time to understand why I felt like what I wanted to share with her was important. I just felt like, again, what I had shared with her really mattered. And I think that was amazing. And here's the funny thing, my last interaction with her was on the same tone, but almost 12 years later. And it was her sharing just what she aspired for me and what she had planned for me. The fact that I had a chance to hear that from her, I feel like was almost kind of the beginning and the closure of her ability to influence my career. That really meant a lot. I think about it every day.

Christine Laperriere:
That is absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much, Suzanne, for a phenomenal interview. I know this was an emotional one. Again, we need to bring these leaders and help share their legacies with everybody. So thank you for taking the time. And I know it was a tough conversation, but thank you.

Suzanne Roy:
Thank you so much. This was an honor. It meant a lot.

Christine Laperriere:
So we're back with the Best Boss Ever show and I'm so excited for my guest today, Kerri-Ann. Thanks so much for joining me.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
So Kerri-Ann, just do a quick introduction so everybody gets to know who you.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Sure. Thank you. So I'm Kerri-Ann Santaguida. I work at American Express. I'm coming up on 20 years this coming January of 2022. I will have been here 20 years and just had an amazing career here in terms of advancement and opportunity. I currently lead the merchant services. I'm the head of merchant services for Canada, so the acquiring business here in Canada, and just have a really exciting job.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. I'm so excited that you joined me because we had an opportunity to work together a couple years ago, as we were featuring some great female leaders in different ... I think it was financial services businesses and some consumer package businesses. So it's really neat that I get a chance to interview on this topic.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I'm thrilled to be here and we had a great time then, and I'm sure we will today as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So who is your best boss ever, and why?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
That is such a reflective question. I have to say when you reached out and asked me if I would join you today, I really took the time to think about that because there's been ... I'm fortunate. I work for an organization who just has a strong culture of amazing leaders. If I reflect back on my best bosses, both of them are here at American Express or were here at American Express at some point in their career. I really have to say that it's interesting. It's a reflection of what does it mean to be the best boss and what are those traits that I look for in a leader who's been memorable to me, and really it's those that have had an impact on my own growth and development over the course of my career. What's really interesting about both these leaders is there's two actually that we're going to talk about.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
They're very different in terms of their styles, but the leaders that I've learned from most over the years are those who have challenged me. My story really starts with American Express. So I joined American Express in January of 2002, and I went off on maternity leave on September 26th, 2002. So nine months after joining this company, I went off to have my first child and I disclosed it upfront to them, said I was expecting when I was in the process with them. They said to me, "Okay, we're investing in you long term, not short term, so come on board." That was my first experience with the company where I was like, "Okay, this is a special place," and that was a very authentic answer that I'd gotten from that leader in that moment in time.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
You fast forward three years later, I'm about to go on maternity leave having my second child, I just won two President's Club awards for my performance as an individual contributor over time, I'd moved into a leadership role and that's when one of my best bosses ever came into the picture and his name is Andy Pilkington.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So Andy is now EVP at the TD Bank, but he is truly this person who took a chance on me. He saw the ambition in me, he opened the door for me to accelerate my career and our story is an interesting one because you know, he promoted me while I was on maternity leave for my second child.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So he called me because a role became available, a director role, and he said, "I think you'd be great for this. I know you've just left. You've just had your second child," and I had just had her. Two or three days after I'd had her, he called to congratulate and he said, "Hey, this happened and we'd really like you to consider this role." So he promoted me while I was on maternity leave. I went through this really quick little process, suddenly I was promoted. I said to him, "Look, I want to be off on mat leave," and he not ask me to come back early. He left that in my decision to make, and then while I was off on mat leave, so two kids, a three year old, a three month old, and he said to me, "This is your role. It's there for whenever you want to come back, you go and just enjoy being a mom right now." So that was an amazing feeling, because anyone who's ever had to think about going off on maternity leave, that's a worrisome time. You're worried about so many different aspects of things.

Christine Laperriere:
I just have to add for my American listeners, Canadian mat leave is one year.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
So this isn't a six week permission. This is a year of you being away from a leadership role.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
100%. That's exactly right, and he was not asking me to shorten it. In the end, I did shorten it, but that was my choice. It was not something that they were asking or he was asking me to do. But another thing happened though, while I was off on mat leave, we went through a really challenging time with my husband's health and he was suddenly diagnosed with a very serious illness. When I had to make the call to Andy to let him know that this is what we were dealing with and for me it was about I had made a commitment, I was going to take on a new leadership role, I was going to move into the organization from a completely different part of the business that I was in before and it had already been announced, and then I said, "Okay, now I'm dealing with this."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
He took the time, A, to understand what I was dealing with and then again say to me, "You do not need to worry about it. This job is here for you when you are ready to come back. You need to go and be the strength that you need to be for your family." Fortunately, our situation from a home perspective turned out well, but it was a super trying time in our life. It stretched me as a mom, as a wife, a leader and it really gave me this opportunity to reflect on what was important to me. I came back from a position of strength because of the things he said and did for me during my transition back in. One of the very first things he did for me was he said, "Okay, we need to put taking care of you on your development plan."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So brand new leader, newly promoted, we put on my development plan, "Taking care of me." He said, "What are the things that you're not getting to do given all of the responsibilities you have at the moment?" One of them was working out, for example. I had to take care of myself and he said, "Your family needs you to be strong. If that's really important to you, let's just work it into your calendar that you'll leave the office at three o'clock every day and you'll go work out at Good Life Fitness, and then you'll come back online when you're ready. You'll manage that." I mean, that's pretty profound when you think about a business area, that's saying, "Put your workout schedule and taking care of you on your own development plan for work."

Christine Laperriere:
I'm just floored over here. I absolutely am. I'm just like, "That is fantastic."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It is. It was a fantastic moment. I realized all these years later he was really just allowing me to be my best self and my best self was all different aspects of me and that's where he brought out the thoughtfulness about recognizing that in the grand scheme of having young kids and managing a very stressful situation and being there to support my husband's health, that I was the one that was being deprioritized in all of that, which makes sense in those moments. But there's so much more to Andy than just a moment like that. He is a networker extraordinaire. I learned that through my career. I am an introvert. I am a learned extrovert for my job and networking is not something that is natural to me, but the techniques and the approach that he takes to networking, I truly believe resonates with people.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It's not only about for his own empowerment and his own expansion of network. It's about the networks that he's creating and he's touching as he goes. He's a very humorous, happy, joyful person to be around and so he brings humor to the table, but he's also a very caring leader. If I think about him from a networking point of view, it wasn't unusual for him to just work the entire time he was heading up to his cottage. He'd be on the phone, just calling random people, checking in on teams, checking in on projects. It wasn't formal, it was casual, but it was meaningful and it really made a difference in someone's life in that moment. I really think that the networking point of view of a senior leader who can get that personal with individuals, it allows you to go the extra mile for a leader like that.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
You want to be able to be engaged and receive that call or be okay to make that call to him. There was always this open door policy that you were always able to leverage. So I think that that's pretty extraordinary as well. If I think about him from a position of what did I really learn from him and what do I take from every single interaction that I have with members of my team today, I think he allowed me to showcase my resilience. There have been different points in my career and in my home life where resilience was really important. We didn't actually talk about that very much in the early days of my career, and I don't mean me with him. I mean, in general people didn't speak about resilience as a strength, but it really truly was a strength of mine and it was something that I continue to be proud of today.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
But I never spoke about it as a strength. I wouldn't get into an interview situation or speaking at an event about resilience in the very early days of my career, the way I to totally would now. He said, "Highlight it as a strength. This is a strength of yours. You should speak about it from a part of your whole self. Resilience is something that we look for in really successful colleagues with American Express, as an example." I think that that's an important call out. He's sort of evolved that thinking around resilience as a strength and us being comfortable talking about it.

Christine Laperriere:
He was doing this 20 years ago when it wasn't mainstream.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Right. Exactly. That's exactly it.

Christine Laperriere:
Which must have even felt even more interesting because you're probably looking around and talking to other people in other careers and having other bosses and you're thinking, "Wow, mine really is a best boss."

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
That's exactly right. He's somebody that I've continued to look towards for advice over my career. There's another piece of advice he gave me after he left that I use in all my mentoring discussions with everyone I have the good fortune of mentoring or sponsoring. He said to me, "Each move that you make in your career should further expand your resume. Take stock of your resume, have a look at it. Is your next role going to grow and develop you and is it going to make you more marketable internally and externally?" I think that that's really good advice. I mean, I think we think about it from a growth and development point of view, but I don't think we put it together in the holistic picture of what does our experience look like and what do we want our experience to be?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I use that to this day with everyone that I mentor and their reaction is the same as my reaction would've been. I was at a crossroads thinking about an opportunity. I thought it was kind of similar to what I was doing and it was Andy who gave me this advice. As I stepped back and I thought about it, I'm like, "Yeah, he's right. This is going to continue to expand my career. It will make me more marketable internally because of the skills I've gained, and externally." If I hadn't had that discussion with him, I probably wouldn't have taken that lateral move. That moment in time. It's really brought my career forward in a different way. So it's interesting how one conversation, one piece of advice, can change the way you look at something.

Christine Laperriere:
Especially from somebody you respect and admire who you know is there to give you good counsel for you. I have a question about Andy. Do you think he lived ... when I hear him asking you to take care of you, did he take care of him? From a resilience perspective, did he invest in his own health and wellness to be the leader that you needed?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Yeah, I think he definitely did. I think it was different depending on the moment of time and what was happening either in the business or in his own personal life, but absolutely I think he did, and he still does, based on my impression of it. Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
It's great to hear too. Some leaders will give really good advice and then they have a hard time living that same advice. So I always kind of have to ask the question, was he able to balance both?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Absolutely. Without a doubt.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm a big of Andy now.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
You mentioned two leaders.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I did, yes. So that takes me to the second leader. His name is Anré Williams. He still works at American Express. He's currently the CEO of American Express National Bank and group president of Enterprise Services. Now I never reported directly to Anré, but what I would say is I've always worked in his organizations and I've always had to be accountable based on all the roles that I had for the market under the different markets that he managed. He is somebody that I have learned my entire career from and continue to this day. So the learning isn't over, but we're in the middle of a learning journey. What I would say about him is he has shaped how I think about different aspects of my own leadership style. So he's a very principled and a very fair leader. He has conviction and he takes a very disciplined approach and principle based approach to how he runs the business, how he makes decisions.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
The important thing about this is that's how you stay out of hot water. With principle based decision-making, you truly have a defendable and clear approach to how and why you made a decision. I think that that is something that I continue to use today. Even as soon as a few days ago, I had to think about a new structure and a new decision-making methodology. The first thing I said to the team is it's going to be principle based, so let's collectively come together and figure out what the principle based approach would be. That was exactly his MO, that is how he does it and that is how I've deployed it with my team. I think it's really important because the other thing about the way that he leads is he champions the voice at the table.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
So everyone has a voice at the table and that's very much how I would lead today. But he was always very clear on who's the decision maker and once the decision's made, we're all moving forward. So there wasn't these shades of gray that allowed you to think about, "Well, did we really make the decision?" Is it really ..." No, the decision is made whoever the decision maker was and it wasn't always him, but whoever the decision maker was, decision made, let's move forward. You can do that when you take this really disciplined principle-based approach and I think that that is something I truly respect in the way he leads.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
He also taught me the importance of data. I'm a salesperson by nature. I'm a relationship builder. Business development is part of what my team does, but data plays a really important role and I'm not necessarily an individual who is a very data driven person. I've now learned to use data as a mechanism to further the business and also to support decisions I'm making or to think about innovative decisions that I want to come across and sort of deliver within my organization. I can do that with data and that's something that I've learned on how he uses data and how I've now transitioned that into my own style of how I bring things forward.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Then the last thing I would say about him is clarity. He just brings clarity to each situation. He's got clear vision, he brings such clarity. So for us, as an example, in one of the lines of businesses I've worked for him, he always had these five areas of focus and everyone could repeat the five areas of focus, and this is something that allows the entire organization to get behind and have clarity. So the way he communicated it just allowed us to all understand exactly where the priorities and the focus needed to be.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
But you always knew where you stood with him because he had such clarity and I could have debates with him privately one on one, I could challenge the status quo and he would always come back with great response on why or why not. We could continue to think about the innovation that was coming forward and he respected your ... and he continues to respect your point of view and he would take it away and think about it, because he was open to new ideas. Often you can get in conversations with a senior leader where there's not a willingness or openness to debate at the table. That is something that I respect in the fact that he very much had an open opinion to that type of thing and would consider it.

Christine Laperriere:
So he encouraged diversity of thought. He actually encouraged different ideas, but then it sounds like he was a good decision-maker too.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Absolutely. Decisive, good decision-maker. There are very different leaders in terms of the way they approach the business, but they had common traits that have made them both successful in their own ways. They've moved up their ranks within their own organization. But one thing that they had in common was they were both really ambitious for me. So they both believed in me, they recognized my results and my contributions and they took the time to understand my values. I'm a very values driven person. So in getting to know me personally and understanding my values and respecting my values, that helped sort of evolve the career perspectives that I was willing to take a chance on or that I wanted. Ultimately in their own unique ways, they've really helped me have my own philosophy and thinking about career advancement and about the way that I mentor and interact with others.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
This is your own unique journey and you really need to be an active participant in it in your own career and you need to be the CEO of you. Ultimately it was my experience with both of them that helped me get to the, "You need to be the CEO of you," and just go for it and not be afraid of your ambition.

Christine Laperriere:
That is amazing. So in my world where you're looking at leaders and how you develop leaders, I guess we're always asking for what's the return on investment. People want to know if they invest $100,000 in their leaders, are they going to get that return on investment to the business and the metrics? That's a very subjective, difficult thing to untangle. Could you give me a guesstimate of what the impact of these two leaders? What's the impact to the business?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
I'm going to give it not in dollars. I'm going to give it in legacy. I mean, the fact that they've both built businesses that have allowed them to put the building box in place for others either to step into or continue with. I think foundational is sort of how I would say. There's both foundational and very specifically from an Anré point of view, probably based on the time he's been at American Express, there's these building blocks and foundational pieces that are set that have just continued to return the investment twofold, both from an innovation point of view, I think from a colleague point of view, like investment in talent. I think about it in customer relationships. You can't actually put a dollar figure on the ROI that comes out of that because that is really just legacy I think, when you think about it from that point of view.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
The fact that the business has grown so significantly under the leadership just speaks overall to the performance of the company. When you're in a top role with a major corporation, the ROI is just all there, but it's like human capital. It's not just about the shareholder point of view. It's about the colleague point of view, the customer point of view, deep relationships. It's significant for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
It's always so hard to nail the that down, but I love the list that you gave. This is, I guess, what my point is. It impacts everything.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It does, and it's culture, right? So it's about everything. Then that culture resonates internally and externally. To work for leaders like that, I mean, I get up every a day inspired. I think about it from my Andy days and working in Anré's organizations, those are days that you feel inspired. You get out of bed, you know exactly what you want to do and there's a spring in your step, even though you're dealing with a one month old and a three year old and critical illness in the moment. But you still rise to the occasion and it's because there's this belief in you and hat's culture, that's caring, that's the power of connection.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and one thing that would've had to happen when you had all that support from, let's use Andy in the example, is that you wouldn't have been leading out of fear of losing your job during that time. You wouldn't have been leading thinking to myself, "Oh my gosh, all these things are going on. I bet everybody thinks I'm not performing." Because I mean, obviously I've worked with clients who are in that head space when there's so much going on at home, they're just fearful of what everybody thinks, which isn't a good leadership mindset.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Absolutely not. No. I didn't have that at all. I had support and encouragement. I basically had anything I needed to be able to make me successful, whether it was a day off to be able to go deal with something, whether it was permission to not attend a meeting because I needed to be in a different appointment. It was as long as you're not taking that to the extreme of abusing it, you've earned the ability to do that and your performance speaks for itself. Right? So it's really about whole self. If you bring your whole self to work, there are different times when your whole self is performing at a higher level than your whole self is on another day. Organizations that recognize this about individuals and really embrace it, I think get a stronger ROI in general from their investment in that colleague.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and then they have you from ... Now, how many years again have you been there?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It'll be 20 years in January of 2022. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You're feeling supported like that. I mean, it's obviously wonderful retention.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Right. I'm still here. Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
All that legacy knowledge and all that information that you hold about the business, they get to continue to enjoy that as well. Kind of just for comparison, when you think of when it hasn't worked as well as it has with Andy and Anré, what does it look like?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
That's an interesting question as well, and I thought about that as well, I have to say, because I think you do an inventory of all your experience and it's not to say that I didn't learn from the worst boss ever. It's just that when it came down to the core of it and I was doing this reflective exercise as I was thinking about coming in to have this conversation with you, I think I mentioned earlier I'm a values driven person. I really realized that the individual I was working for was different than I was in terms of our values. Because our values and what we put at the forefront of our values was different, doesn't mean it was wrong, it was just different than how I was perceiving my values, they were mismatched. It didn't feel good. It didn't feel aligned.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
It always felt like it was a bit of an uphill battle and climb to really get on the same page. That just made it more difficult. We still had a successful relationship. It's just the individual didn't take the time to get to know me, understand my values and it's a two way street. So I probably had a role to play in that, but just the leadership philosophy and the approach was different and it just didn't align with my own approach. I'm a customer first driven person. I work for a customer oriented organization and when that individual's just got a different philosophy, it doesn't feel good and there's this conflict that happens.

Christine Laperriere:
What was the philosophy that you observed in that other leader?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
If I think about it right down to the core, it was an ambitious me first sort of attitude. That is not who I am. So I think about the whole. I don't think about the me in that situation. When the leadership was happening with a me first, it just felt like everything else was an afterthought. Because of that moment in that approach, it doesn't feel good. You don't feel inspired and motivated to jump out of bed every day. You collectively want to always do the right thing, but there are moments of reflection in there where I was really close to saying, "This isn't working. I think I need to move on." That's not a fun place to be in, but you know when it's not working and for me the value piece and the me first piece just didn't work for me from a leadership style point of view.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly the point too. So when you're working for someone with such conflicting values, they're not getting the best work out of you. So if you're in the back of your head debating over whether or not you still belong, we just have to be honest, your performance is not the same as it is under an Andy, where he's saying, "Doesn't matter what's happening, you're safe. I got your back." So that's the thing about performance is that you can have extremely high performing people who perform at different levels under different leaders.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
100%. Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
It's just a great example to kind of compare to these two great leaders that you worked with. So I would love to know just as we bring this to close, what is the ... I work with a lot of leaders who are early in their career and they're aspiring to be a best boss one day. What are the words of wisdom that you would share with them?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Ooh, that's a good question. Words of wisdom. Okay. I think the first thing is manage your career with intent. So I think that if you have aspirations to be a boss, you should manage your career with intent. I think that you should understand the power of connection, and really make sure that you leverage the connections. That sort of then springboards me into the power of networking. I think I mentioned, not my favorite thing to do, but such an important thing to do. Because if you think about it as being a boss, the more are networked you are either internally or externally, you can open doors, you can remove roadblocks for your team. Your team can learn from the relationships. You can introduce your teams to those relationships. I think it's just really important that you continue to think about what that means for yourself and for your broader team.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Then I think about the principle based approach. I think if you are in a situation where you need to be making decisions, or you need to be able to articulate strategies and the decision you've made against them, if you take a principle based approach and make it consistent across all the decisions you're making that relate to that strategy or to that subject, you're going to ensure that you're passing on a skill-set to your colleagues and to your teams that they continue to evolve in their own decision making.

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Then the last thing is just be the CEO of you, because no one else is going to do that. You are the CEO of you. I've said it to both my children. You're the CEO of you. You really have to think about what that means as you evolve your careers and you start thinking about what you want from an education point of view or whatever that is, how you continue to grow and learn. I talk about this all the time with people that I mentor. It's really important to have clarity, set goals, think about it for yourself, but be the CEO of you.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. That's fantastic. Now, I am going to ask you one more question just because I wanted to probe. I heard you mention mentoring. Any tips for those of us who are out there attempting to help mentor and really support future talent?

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Yeah. I mean the first tip I would have is just do as much of it as you can, because what I find is I get as much out of it as the mentee is getting from the relationship with me. It's a two-way street. There's no which way I would speak about it differently. It's a two-way street. I always learn from every single person I'm in a mentoring relationship with, and there's just such good growth. It's about carving out time to do it. It's not going to come naturally. You literally have to be very disciplined about it and you have to just set the time, in my case, in my calendar for it. I don't mentor just people within my organization. I'm also mentoring outside of my organization and I think that that's really important because the learnings you get or the talent you meet ...

Kerri-Ann Santaguida:
Well, it's not self-serving. The intent isn't to bring them into American Express. At some point they have career aspirations that I can open a door either through my network or through my own organization. I think it's so important to give back and I think you just have to make the time for it. How do I do it? I do it through organizations like Women of Influence or whatever organization I'm part of. You meet people and then suddenly there's a connection and you build off that connection and you get into a mentoring relationship. So sometimes it's formal and sometimes it's impromptu and you've met someone at an event and it turns into a lunch that turns into a more regular touch base of a mentoring type relationship. So I highly encourage people to give back because I think it's really important.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. Well, Kerri-Ann, this has been amazing. I know already that I have lots of listeners who are going to love hearing your story today and especially hearing about these two best bosses. They were great examples. So thank you so much.

Episode: 19
Title: Understanding my passion
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Bryan Shone

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the boss that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperrier.com, and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. And with me today, I have Bryan Shone. I'm so excited that you're here.

Bryan Shone:
Oh, it's great to be here. Thanks very much for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
Just for everybody's frame a reference, give me a little introduction on yourself so everyone knows who you are.

Bryan Shone:
Sure. Well, as you said, my name is Bryan Shone. I'm the executive director at Hamilton Children's Aid, and I've worked in the not-for-profit sector for 26 years now, working to support children and families in the community. And love what I'm doing and continue to enjoy leading in this field.

Christine Laperriere:
This was the reason why I really wanted you to be on the show. And I'm so glad that you decided to be a guest, because most of the people I interview on the show are in corporations or big companies, and your expertise being a non-for-profit, and also being a leader in that space. I'm just kind of curious, again, some of the themes are going to be similar, and I'm kind of curious where some might be different. But I think it's neat for people to get at a well-balanced point of view by hearing your leadership experience in that space.

Bryan Shone:
There are some things definitely that are similar, but there's probably some things that are a little bit different than in the corporate sector as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell us a little bit about who your best boss ever is.

Bryan Shone:
My best boss ever, really, I think when I was reflecting, really let me be who I was. So I was able to come to work authentically. One of the things that can be the same or a little different in the not for profit world is the passion for the work. When we get to work with children and families on a regular basis, that's something that you can really delve into and dive into. And my best boss definitely brought up the best in me by understanding what made me passionate and what helped to move me forward in my work.

Christine Laperriere:
How did they do that? I'm just curious. Did they ask good questions? Was it certain coaching? How did they find those things that were important to you?

Bryan Shone:
Yeah. When I think back on it, I think first and foremost, getting to know me as a person. So yes, getting to know me as an employee and what my role was and helping me to understand how I might work in the sector. But also getting to know me, what were my passions? Why was I doing this work? And what was it that I really wanted to accomplish? Not only did they encourage me to think about that, but then they also challenged me to do it. And then pushed me a little bit further than what I might even be comfortable in thinking about.

Bryan Shone:
So, as I was reflecting, I kind of thought, oftentimes, people are talking about the best bosses ever from the context of they were supportive, they were helpful. Sometimes it was uncomfortable. And when I look back on that, I feel like that was the time when the learning really happened. And when they were challenging me, it was also from a supportive perspective. So they were challenging me. They knew me well enough to know that I wanted to move forward, but also knew how far I was able to go in that moment and then continued to help me grow over time.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you describe a situation where you remember being a bit uncomfortable? I mean, as much as you can share?

Bryan Shone:
Certainly. I think one of the times that I was uncomfortable was in just, in the work that we do, a lot of what we're dealing with are our own biases, things that we might take for granted. But families and children that we serve come from different backgrounds, different cultures, different realities. And as a result of that, you always need to be very aware of where you're positioned in relation to, for instance, a family.

Bryan Shone:
And so sometimes, that becomes uncomfortable when you're thinking about a situation in a certain way and your best boss ever is saying, "Are you sure that it's ex actually that way? Give me a couple of other ideas of what it might be." And what was interesting is when I was doing that, when I was doing frontline work with families directly before I moved into management, it very much prepared me to then help and support those who I was working with when I became a manager, and ultimately, an executive director. I find to this day that I'm not necessarily doing a lot of telling people what to do, but I'm asking a lot of questions.

Bryan Shone:
And I think that's one of the things that my best boss ever did that I take with me to this day.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. What did you learn about yourself as you went through that experience working with that leader?

Bryan Shone:
The first thing that I learned was that I could do a lot more than I gave myself credit for at times. And secondly, that best boss ever really gave me an opportunity to do things that they were doing. So it almost moved me into the role of what they were doing before I actually got into that role. So it did a couple of things. One is it challenged me to think beyond what my current job was. But secondly, what it did was it gave me confidence that when I decided to move into that type of role, that I could do that role and made me a little more familiar with what that might look like, as well as test that out and see if that was something that was also for me.

Christine Laperriere:
And then can I ask you, given that your leadership, obviously, there's probably metrics and results that you work toward. When you work for a best boss under those... Your job is so interesting though, because it's definitely, the end game is much different than what some of us are facing in the business will world. So help me understand, what's the impact of having a great leader in your space versus the impact of working for a not great leader? What's the difference in outcome?

Bryan Shone:
I think first and foremost, the outcomes and metrics might be slightly different, but it's still important to have outcomes and metrics. When we talk about families and children that we serve, we're really talking about longer term outcomes. People being successful in their family lives as well as in their personal lives with our youth. One of the things that it taught me was, number one, that you need metrics and that you need to be always looking at the outcomes that you're trying to achieve.

Bryan Shone:
One of the things that they taught me really was to look at setting your intentions. I've learned how to do that over time and try and set my intentions now for our organization in a way that gets people excited and gets people engaged. I think that when I think about my not so best boss or bosses, I think what I'd more think about is that they were very much focused on the task, tended to unfortunately get into the weeds and perhaps, micromanage a little bit. At the end of the day, it sort of stripped away confidence rather than added to confidence.

Bryan Shone:
They were able to challenge. But the challenge without the excitement of, "You can do this," really becomes a weighing factor, I think, on your development. And so trying not to do that. The other piece that's interesting is that people talk about accountability as if it's a negative word. And I've really learned, I think over time, that that's not necessarily a negative word. Accountability is really about what helps to move us forward. And so when I'm talking about a best boss ever, and I'm talking about accountability, it's a little different than my not so best boss, in the sense that a sense of accountability is more about what you're not doing, as opposed to challenging you to be better at what you are doing. So that's kind of what I reflect on when I think about that juxtaposition.

Christine Laperriere:
The differences. And if you had to teach or advise future leaders on how to be wonderful leaders in your space, what would you encourage them to really focus on?

Bryan Shone:
Well, I think first and foremost, I would say engagement. So making sure that people have an opportunity to be part of the organization and part of the change that you're wanting to see within your leadership. The second piece would really be about how you continue to grow people and making sure that you know them well, making sure that you're interested in their wellbeing and that you also challenge them to continue to grow and to develop over time.

Christine Laperriere:
So I just wanted to ask you some questions about the type of work that you do, particularly that you're leading in. Like I said, such a unique environment where the outcome is based on families. It's on the benefit for families. First of all, I mean, you must have some hard days. What is that like?

Bryan Shone:
Oh, a hard day can be some pretty impactful pieces of work. Sometimes there are family situations that are quite challenging, sometimes there's dangers. So our focus is really on the safety of children and the care of their families. Some of those days can be really difficult. We're in a sector that really focuses a lot on compliance. There's a lot of stress that's associated for many of our staff around that.

Bryan Shone:
But I would also say that the other side of that is the ability to really make a difference and a change. And so many people don't know this. And when we talk about children's aid, we're often talking about children being removed or being taken away. I mean, most people don't realize that as an agency at Hamilton, we're now at 98% of families that are together that we're working with on a regular basis.

Bryan Shone:
And so it's about when you were talking about metrics a few minutes ago, it's about understanding those metrics from an outcomes perspective. We've been able to see a reduction in the last couple of years of about 20% to 25% of our children in care. And we've been able to keep them in the community. Now, we can't do that without strong community partnerships and really working together with all community organizations across Hamilton in order to do that.

Bryan Shone:
So our bad days are difficult, but we have more good days than we have bad days. It really is looking for those, those outcome long term. Recently, what we did is instead of looking at the compliance pieces, we really looked at a vision for the organization, which engaged our staff, engaged the community, and we're engaging families in that endeavor to move forward and to maybe change some of the perceptions that the child welfare has had in the past as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So when they're focused on a vision for the future then, tell me how that's a little bit different than being focused on compliance.

Bryan Shone:
There's lots and lots of things in child welfare that we need to focus on. Government metrics, looking at a number of different things. There's requirements that need to send in all of the time. And all of them are really related to how we provide service. So, how often we might see a family, or the type of planning we do with a family. And all of that is important, but I would suggest that it's really not enough, because the question that we still need to ask is why are all of those things important?

Bryan Shone:
So for instance, when you go and you see a family, that's the compliance piece. But what you do with the family when you're with them, that's really the outcomes piece. What does that look like? How are you adding value? How are you supporting that family to be able to be successful? Oftentimes, we're working with families that are disadvantaged in our communities. So struggling with poverty, there's been lots and lots of information, I think, in the community over the last little while about the impact of race, Black families, indigenous families, which are all overrepresented in child welfare.

Bryan Shone:
And so we really need to think about the outcomes that we're trying to achieve even more so than the standards. We need to look at those, but we also need to be thinking about what this looks like in the future state, as opposed to current statement.

Christine Laperriere:
That's very brilliant. I can see why that's a shift in perspective, because I even see that in the business world, where we're focused on process for the sake of process, but we're not actually thinking long term, what is the benefit or value or impact we're actually trying to make by following all these steps? So I can hear the correlation there where you're getting people out of the weeds and getting them to think, how do we really have meaning in the way that we interact with families?

Bryan Shone:
I think that depending on what you're doing in business, you're focusing largely on quantitative measures or quantitative outcomes, how much of something you've made in a certain period of time, or how many clients you've served and those types of things. Really, we need to be looking at the longer term and it's really that qualitative piece as well as the quantitative. So what does it look like to get feedback from our community and our families? When are we adding value to the work that's being done? How is that being defined?

Bryan Shone:
Well, that gets defined through our community here in Hamilton. And it also gets defined from the children, and the families, and youth that we serve. Really, what we're trying to do is we're focusing in six areas, but really the first two are service areas. One is to support children and families within the community and home through adding supports, early help and support, utilizing the assets of a family themselves.

Bryan Shone:
So one of the things that we recognize is that families that are isolated tend to have multiple challenges. And often, for anybody that's a parent, I say, "Imagine that you didn't have anybody when your kids were six months old. And what would that look like?" And imagine that you have housing insecurity challenges at the same time. You weren't sure where you were going to live and you're trying to navigate a system at the same time.

Bryan Shone:
Well, that's the kind of thing that many of our families are struggling with. And so it's trying to knit together that social safety net. So I often say that child welfare is really a safety net under a social safety net. Families that we may not be captured in the day to day services that you and I might hear about in our community. Oftentimes, it's us helping to support pulling them back up into that social safety net.

Christine Laperriere:
And you're right. I mean, I can only imagine, I was pivoting an entire business from in-person to virtual with a two and a four year old and being locked inside when they closed all the parks. That was the particular, my heart goes out to people, because you're right. I wasn't worried about whether the roof was going to be over our head. And that was the one thing that I could sleep at night knowing, but just trying to figure out how to keep up with everything was nothing I've ever experienced.

Bryan Shone:
One of the things that ended up working really well and we just tried our best because you're working through it in the same way that you're talking about in terms of a business and kids. But for so many of our staff, it was the same reality. And you've got staff that still need to go out and see families right as well in crisis type of situations. And so we tried to be as flexible as possible. Our work hours became really, really flexible. Working from home. We haven't gone back to, I'm at the office, but we haven't gone back to everyone being in the office because it's worked so well. Now, the challenge is almost on the other side now, which is, "All the kids are in bed and I have 20 minutes. I can go on, I can answer some emails," and that kind of thing. So we're trying to encourage people to put down the computer, close the computer from time to time, and have some away time as well.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's amazing that you understood that, because I feel like some leaders were not empathetic to how challenging it really was for people to literally run a full-time school while running a full-time career in any field. And like you said, I saw the burnout hit really hard, especially that third wave that we went through here in Canada, just the amount of burnout. And I know I felt it personally, but the people I was coaching were really next level. I've not seen anything quite like that. And then it must be challenging for your staff, because again, so they're at home with that challenge, but then their work life is also family challenge. So it's like they're pivoting from one version of family challenges at home to another version of family challenges at work.

Bryan Shone:
And in some situations, those challenges being similar. So you got a single parent. You're empathizing with some of the same things that are happening. And you're also trying to support and give advice. I mean, it is a little like some of your work around coaching. You're coaching a family through it and you're like, "Yeah. This is really hard for me as well." That creates some real opportunities, but it creates definitely some challenges where you feel like you can't away from it. Sometimes you might go, "Oh, I can go to work and get away from that just for a couple minutes or an hour," but they're going back into their families and then doing the same.

Christine Laperriere:
That's so interesting to me. You're right. I definitely had experiences where someone would be doing the same thing I'm doing at home and looking for coaching. And I almost want to just sit down with a box of Kleenex as I go. It's really hard.

Bryan Shone:
You're right.

Christine Laperriere:
You're right. I got no answers. It's just really bad. Any other pieces you want to add to this that you think would be interesting for people who are listening right now?

Bryan Shone:
If I was to give one piece of advice is when we talk about this change, sort of that outcome space piece, it's messy and it's not easy. And it's easier in some ways to be able to check off each of the pieces that you're doing. So for leaders that are, are moving through transformational efforts in your organizations, it's trying to maintain that focus for a longer period of time, but also suggest that from time to time, you're going to hit challenges. It's hard to paint the picture of where you want to go and to support people to get there. But I would say that it's completely worth it in the end, but that doesn't mean there aren't questions, there aren't people that are trying to understand what you're trying to do. And just to keep on keeping on, keep focusing on clarifying, supporting people through that process. And you'll get through to the other side of where you want to be.

Christine Laperriere:
So how has COVID of change the way that you lead, especially given probably the demand on your community during COVID?

Bryan Shone:
Well, the demand to our community during COVID is interesting, because I like to talk about early help and early support. And we've been trying very hard as part of our vision to provide early help and support so families don't end up in crisis. That has been a challenge during COVID, because lots and lots of services had to go virtual. Sometimes during COVID, families came to us, not so early. And as a result of that, families were sometimes in crisis. I think that that created some unique challenges for us and unique challenges for families as well. We've been working very closely with a number of community supports and working together as a community to try and solve some of those challenges. And we've been doing that really since COVID started.

Bryan Shone:
Some of the strengths though with COVID is the virtual perspective and having access to virtual services has also been helpful. So we've been able to connect sometimes with extended family members, we've been able to connect with families in a different kind of way. One of the things that we did early on is we realized that a number of our families struggled with technology. And as a result of that, we put some things in place so that families had the technology to be able to have conversations like you and I are having today through a virtual means.

Bryan Shone:
Our staff, I think, first and foremost, have done an amazing job. So unlike some other companies, we were an essential service. And so we worked face-to-face with families throughout this whole process. So definitely some challenges is around. What does that look like and how do we stay safe? We keep our community safe at the same time. I just can't say enough about the leadership team and the staff that serve families in our organization. They've been able to pivot and move through that in a really amazing way.

Bryan Shone:
And the waves of COVID were also a challenge, because sometimes, we were able to be out there more easily than in other times. We've kind of had to ebb and flow with the different waves. And that's definitely been a challenge, but we've been able to provide service all the way through. And that's in huge part to all of the work that people are doing here every day.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Bryan. This is fantastic. Again, I'm just so thankful that you came and shared your story and your insights with me.

Bryan Shone:
Great. Well thank you for having me. I really enjoyed myself.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast
Episode: 2
Title: Upward servng versus downward serving
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Gary Mottershead

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. Welcome, Gary. I'm so excited to have you on the show. And just before we get started, why don't you do a quick intro?

Gary Mottershead:
Well, great. Thank you, Christine. You and I have really enjoyed the relationship that we've had and just a bit of background. I have been at work for a long time, a few decades now at this point, and I've started a couple of companies. So I'm president and founder of GCP Industrial Products. And the way that I know you is really through Strategic Coach. And I've been a coach for entrepreneurs for, I'm in my 25th year now. And a participant been in Strategic Coach for my 30th year. That's how we get to know each other. I have my own business, but also had the opportunity like you have to help other people grow and achieve their passions. That's Gary.

Christine Laperriere:
Perfect, and the reason that I thought you needed to be on The Best Boss Ever podcast was because I get the impression from our relationship that you've not only got an incredible history of working as a leader and working for a number of different leaders, but also the fact that today you actually coach and mentor a number of different leaders through the Strategic Coach program. Really the mission of this podcast is to extract those amazing stories about those leaders who are the best bosses ever. And I felt like there was a high probability that you would've either worked for some of them and, or coached and mentored some as well. So thank you so much. And I would just say, even just for starters, who is your best boss ever? Can you think of a leader that you worked for like that?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, you sent some notes out to begin with and I had a look at it and I'm going to say part of it was a challenge. And the sense of the challenge is that I've been on my own for more than 30 years. And so I think one of the reasons that I did that is I learned a lot about being bosses and some of them not so good and some of them good. And an interesting thing was a boss that I remember really well was when I joined DuPont and I'd come out of Imperial Oil, the Exxon Organization, and I went into industrial sales for the first time. I hadn't done that before, but I wanted to try it. And this was a grizzly older guy and it kind of hit one unibrow across here.

Gary Mottershead:
His name was Doug Hager. I walked into a brand new thing, I'm a young guy, and all wet behind the ears, so to speak. And I'm going into sales and he'd certainly been there all along, sales manager, and that's where he was going to be in his career. He wasn't going to go any further. And one of the things I really appreciated about Doug, he was tough on me. But in a kind way, if you can accept that sort of way is that he made sure, but he also allowed me to be myself. And just to put a little bit of a story together. I followed a guy who was totally well respected. His name was John Thode and at that point in DuPont I was in the plastics division and we were selling products made in the US.

Gary Mottershead:
Most of the division up there was working all in the Canadian made products. But there's a few of us at the US stuff. So we had to work with the US. And that's how I learned. I mean I've spent my whole life working in the United States. And this is where I first learned how to do that. But Doug was one of those guys who just allowed me to be me. And so when I was following this other gentleman, who'd done that job for 12 or 13 years, totally respected. I had to go across Canada. He was totally bilingual, and I wasn't. And I remember a couple of incidents that we were down in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and we're going in to have lunch. And I come into the restaurant after Doug and I was totally sheepish. And he goes, "What's up?"

Gary Mottershead:
I said, "Well, I locked the keys in the trunk." And I go, man, this has got to be what I later would call an SCI, serious career impediment. And at that point in time, so again, we had a rental car, whatever, how do you get to it? And you had locked, and they weren't all electronic things as you had now, because this is way back and that would've been what, I joined DuPont in anyway in early '90s, whatever case was. Anyway, but I remember taking out the back seat of the car, taking out the back part of the seat of the car. And I was small enough that I could get through the crossbars and reach in to get the keys in the car. And he just let me do all of this stuff. And I go, you know what?

Gary Mottershead:
That was the best thing he could have done. He let me be me. He let me make the mistakes. He supported me. And the thing that I learned, you talked about that he wasn't well respected in the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
Really?

Gary Mottershead:
He was not well respected because I think, because when you ask this question, what I found in corporations, in corporate is that you had to be really upward serving and not downward saving. So upward serving is that you looked after your boss, you didn't necessarily look after people.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.

Gary Mottershead:
And you spent more time in large organizations. I spent about 10 years and that was enough for me to do that. And I found that. So, but he looked after me and he was not the kind of guy, he was gruff and always wasn't the neatest one. So he didn't fit the whole corporate mold to do all that. And dealing with the US, I know you're an American, I was born an American. You have to have a particular way that you go about doing that. And you ruffle the feathers, they don't need to know that you've ruffled the feathers so to speak, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And he couldn't do that because he was his own guy and he eventually retired out there. But what was really great it was the first time that I had ventured into the sales side of things and out of the, what more protected corporate world that I was in at Imperial Oil. And no longer being just an engineer, but being in sales and I look back upon that time and that was a really formative time. I mean, that really set the direction for me because I was not meant to be in the corporate world for, and talk about bosses. I always felt that I knew better than my bosses and that doesn't go over very well.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, well, and sometimes what do we do? It is what it is. But no, this is interesting. I'm just kind of rehashing the story because it's very interesting to me. It wasn't so much, you don't remember him so much for him, his softness sounds like again, he had kind of that hard edge, but he allowed you to be you. And then also I thought of what you said here about he wasn't upward serving. He was actually, he didn't play the political game necessarily upwards, but it sounded like he was really there for you as you were trying to transition. And he gave you space to make that transition, which is really interesting. That makes him a very memorable boss in your career.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, absolutely. Because when you look at bosses is that it's got to mean something to you, not just for them. And I mean to me, that's what a best boss is all about. That they're looking out for your world and for their world. And I don't know what you'll find as you go through the other people that you interview. You'll certainly find some common characteristics and common traits, but I would suspect from the people that I've coached over, it's those who say, who really understand what the other person needs to have. And it's no different than life. And you're married, I'm married to our partners. We have to understand, it's a similar kind of situation. And so that's really the important part.

Gary Mottershead:
If we're thinking all about us, that's all about me. You can be as smart as you want. You can be as intelligent as anything, but people aren't going to relate to you.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
What are they going to relate to? They're going to relate to what you do for them. And I don't care what aspect of life that is. And so that's what I've learned. And that's what I really picked up through all of this. And I learned those that would accept cause even at DuPont, I had people who I knew very smart who did things, but I had to disagree with them. And disagreeing with a boss is not a good thing in a corporation, because it doesn't matter, okay? It doesn't, it's not their money. What do they have to say?

Gary Mottershead:
What do they have to do? And so if I can give you another little story, which you'd probably find cute on the opposite side. Doug was a sales manager and Doug worked for a gentleman who was the vice president of Plastics. And so in their wisdom, they gave the United Way campaigns, if you recall those to some of the young guys. And so the goal in the organization that we'd have 80% participation. You put up those thermometer charts, right? Down in the hallways and everything else. Everybody's in the hallways. We're down in the Toronto Dominion Center, 27th floor of the Toronto Dominion Center, so it's big group people. And so I had the thermometer chart and we keep getting up there. And the vice president would report to the president how his division in plastics was a pretty big division.

Gary Mottershead:
And so it got to the point that he told the president, he had 80% participation, everything else. And then he comes down the next week and the chart's up to 100%. He tells the president, he's got 100% participation. He feels really good. It was a big deal. So the next week comes in, we're at 110%. He comes storming down to my office. He was a big man. And said, Gary, "How can we be at 110%?" I said, "The goal was 80%. We've overachieved the 80% goal for the corporation." He was furious. Absolutely furious because the goal was 80%. That was 100% achievement to me.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay, hang on a second. Explain this to me. You guys blew the number out of the water.

Gary Mottershead:
What we did was, the goal of the corporation was to have 80% of the people participate.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
To me, achieving the goal was 100%.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
So when we got to 80%, the thermometer chart read 100%. He told the president that he had 100% of his whole division participating.

Christine Laperriere:
Got it.

Gary Mottershead:
And then the next week he comes back and it's 110% and he's absolutely furious.

Christine Laperriere:
And now he is mad because right, you're over the 80%, which was the original target, the 100% of the target.

Gary Mottershead:
I realized sometimes that my way of looking at things was not the way everybody else was going to look at things.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, go ahead.

Christine Laperriere:
No, and I'm curious, as a leader, when you were working for Doug, how do you think he handled that?

Gary Mottershead:
Well, Doug kind of loved it because I would always challenge the authority and only if I felt I was right. It wasn't just for challenging it. And I can think of several instances when I did that, but I also realized that I wasn't then made for that world because you being an individual. So the other part about being a good boss is understanding the people and who they are as individuals.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And relating to those individuals and what they need. And so being equal to everybody is not necessarily fair because people need different things at different times. And different trainings, different attention. And so when I go back and I think about that, I always thought of Doug very fondly in that he really helped me along.

Gary Mottershead:
Not because he was the smartest guy, because he wasn't necessarily. He was a survivor in an organization and he also then accepted what his role was going to be. But instead of taking it out, some people when they get to their level and that's it, as far as they're going to go, they take out their frustrations on other people. And oftentimes it's the people that work for them, but Doug didn't do that. And so he really mentored me along in that respect.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, which is two years into 10 years that I spent in corporations. I spent the next eight years at DuPont and then it was time to move on.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, then one of the questions I'd love to ask just for comparison, you don't have to name names, but worst boss ever. Or one that stands out in your mind as having made an impact on you from even poor leadership judgment. What was that like?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, there's a couple. The one that I mentioned, I'll give another story, but there's another one early on. And it's just, when you could tell that people weren't being honest. There was dishonesty about them and they may have been, and I saw this more those who were in more the, what I'll call more the sales side of things and particularly going back like 30 plus years now. And it was a different world than it is today. Being an engineer by training. But just to see what that part of the world could get away with. And then when they were made into managers and management, they kind of tried to do the same thing. Still looking out for themselves, being upward serving, but not really being honest. And we could see right through that and everybody pays lip service to it because they're in a position of responsibility, but there's not a lot of following.

Gary Mottershead:
There's not a lot of feeling and camaraderie around let's rally around and work together. It kind of puts everybody off on their own. And the same thing happened with that gentleman who was the vice president is that I had certain feelings about customers that we have. And I remember, and he was a big man. He was about twice my size. And I remember being in a meeting one day with him, with customers and I'd known a bit about these customers that he didn't, and he was telling me that these guys were right. And I knew they weren't. And I told him in front of him that they weren't right. And that was the beginning of the end at DuPont. Cause I said what, it meant nothing to me except that my own integrity.

Gary Mottershead:
And so I looked at it and said, when you talk about best bosses, I think there are things you learn from your bosses. And I think some of the ones that aren't that good also are actually really good bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
Teachers.

Gary Mottershead:
Because we have to learn in life what not to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
You know? And you can tell, cause this goes back a long time as I've been more than 30 years now. Those are the things have stuck with me in those 10 years that I was there. There were a few others of course that I did appreciate. But when I look back over it now, the ones that I appreciated all really cared. They cared about people. They genuinely were looking out for your livelihood as well as their livelihood. And when you're in a corporation, that's a hard balance to have.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And balance both of those as you would've seen. So you either look upward and so you can move upward and have upward mobility. Or if you look downward, it probably keeps you from getting upward. So it has a double edged sword to it.

Christine Laperriere:
Interesting. But if we were to give a nugget for someone out there right now who is trying to be a best boss ever, right? They are very committed to their people and being fantastic leaders. What I'm hearing is this focus on not just upward serving, but also downward serving and the ability to balance, really understanding what other people need. But this isn't just what they need to get work done. This is what they need at a personal level to feel like they're contributing and really enjoying the work that they're doing.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, it's a good question. Good thought to that. And what I've learned over the time is that you can do both of those things. You can, and a really good boss to me is one who figures out how to get the best out of everybody, and really allows them to grow. And as they grow, because that's what people want today. I know you're a little younger than I am. And I look back over the generations, I have children in their 30s now. And so what do they want, what do they need? Everybody appreciates someone who helps them grow. And then there's an attachment to all of that. Well, if the boss is smart, the boss realizes as the people below him grow, he gets to grow, and he gets to do it.

Gary Mottershead:
That's the really smart thing. And so I think today, and I think particularly we're in the kind of world that we're in right now that we're all operating off of Zoom and in virtual world. I think there's more opportunity to do that. Christine, I really think that.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Gary Mottershead:
Instead of having to play the politics. And I love it when I go to Strategic Coach and Dan says, the CEOs don't really like this because their box is the same size as everybody else's box on the TV. And they don't have any hierarchy of position or anything like that. All the trappings of the world have gone. Well, now it's up to you. If you're authentic and you care and you help them grow, they'll help you grow.

Gary Mottershead:
And there can be a lot to that, but I try and simplify things down and said now how you get it all done is more complicated. But those are the things that I break it down to. And I think that's where today, when you're talking about the nugget, that people have got in the kind of world that we're going to operate in, regardless of whether, how long the pandemic continues or not, we're still going to be in this, in this virtual world environment. Those that can relate across this environment. Those that can and get other people motivated and going are the ones that are going to be the true and the best bosses and the great leaders in my opinion.

Christine Laperriere:
Great, thank you. That is perfect. That is exactly what I know so many of us want to hear that right now because we need to get focused on new sets of leadership skills in a way for this new way of working. It's a completely different game now. Thank you so much for that. Do you have anything else you want to add just as we bring this to a close?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah. I'd say you need to evolve. You need to continue to evolve. And I think you can bring the sets of skill that we had at the beginning of 2020 into 2021 where we are now. I think you can bring those. And the key thing is now you have to figure out how to operate, what I'll call facing the camera, as opposed to behind the camera. And those of us like you, Christine, or I who have been presenting and presenting for quite a while. I've had to figure that out. Otherwise, you wouldn't survive. And that's how to be authentic with that. And the authenticity comes from making sure that as one person told me, when I first started to coaching, they said, Gary, I see two people at the front of the room.

Gary Mottershead:
I see you and I see the program. Those two have to come together. So the key is that there's no hiding when we have a Zoom, there's no hiding. You see everybody, you get to see everything. It's actually quite intimate because you see everybody's face a lot closer than you would if you're in a room, especially if you're in a room with multiple people. So as a result of that, you have to learn how to be authentic. Once you're authentic now, and people get that. Now you've got everybody following and you can lead. If you keep trying, and so I put it this way. There's a difference between performing and acting. And performing is getting better at being yourself and acting is trying to be somebody else.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
We need to learn how to perform in these situations. So what does the people that you're with need? What does the organization need to help you do that? And then perform to the best of your abilities? My next door neighbor up in Collingwood was saying, Gary, I know I told him what I was doing as coach for people says, I have real trouble speaking. [inaudible 00:20:50] I'm a CFO for a company out west. And so I was all on Zoom and I happened to know something about that. He was an awesome racer, ski racer. And so I said to him said, Greg, what did you do to prepare for a race? Did you do the same as if your training race? No, I said, then you have to prepare. So to be at your best, you have to prepare for any of your presentations, such as you would prepare for if you're doing your race and you're going to go race downhill, you have to put it in the same context.

Gary Mottershead:
He was still Greg, whether he was training or whether he was racing, but there was a different intensity. There was a different way. And he was excellent and he was excellent that he still does the adult racing and that sort of thing. But he couldn't see how the two related. So you have to look at your own life and say, where did I have to perform at my best? And what did I have to do that? And in a team, that's the same thing. As a boss, what do I have to do to be at my best for them and for them to be able to be at their best. And I think if you do that part of it. So it's not so self-serving, it'll actually serve you very well as the boss. You'll serve the organization, but also serve the people that you work with.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, excellent. Thank you so much. And again, we're just thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.

Gary Mottershead:
My pleasure. And I wish you all the best with this, as I know you'll do really well. But it's an exciting project. I think it's really worthwhile right now, too, because people are struggling to figure out what's next for them.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. Today, I have Barry on the show. I'm so thankful that you're here today. Thank you so much.

Barry Danilowitz:
I'm delighted to be here, Christine. Thank you for inviting me.

Christine Laperriere:
Barry, can you tell everybody a little bit about yourself as we get started?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. So my name is Barry Danilowitz. I am currently the Vice President of Retail Product Distribution at Scotiabank. I've worked in the financial sector for probably half my career on the client side. The other half of my career, I actually worked in the software and hardware development industry.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I've sort of seen both sides of the table and had a great many wonderful bosses in the course of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
And I have to add here that I'm so excited you took time to do this podcast with me because I coach about 50 women a year at Scotiabank as part of this program that I lead, and I was telling one of the women one day about the Best Boss Ever Podcast. And she got so excited and she couldn't wait to tell me how you were her best boss ever, and so she just beamed. At one point I said, "I'll have to make sure we make time for coaching," because she was so excited to tell me about the impact that you had on her as a leader.

Christine Laperriere:
So we reached out to you, we asked you if you'd like to be on the show. And so, today this is exciting for me to get a chance to work with you.

Barry Danilowitz:
That's great to hear. Thank you for sharing. And she is a wonderful individual and I'm glad she shared that story. And I hope what I have to say today is helpful to others.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you tell me a little bit about your best boss ever, or your best bosses ever?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. Yeah, and this was a fun exercise to go back through my resume and look at my career and reflect back. And what struck me, the thing that came to mind, first of all, was a boss I had very early in my career when I was just starting out, working as a hands-on Technologist. And he had all the characteristics of a great boss, friendly, supportive, had a lot of trust, great feedback, et cetera.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I think I probably worked for him for maybe a year-and-a-half. And in one of our meetings, he said to me, "Barry, you don't have to do this job your entire career." And he proceeded to explain to me all the other things that I could do, and it was sort of two messages. One, it was, "FYI pal, there's a big world out there and you shouldn't think that somebody's going to tap you on the shoulder." And I think that's the important message that everybody needs to hear, that careers need to be built and they take work, and so that was great.

Barry Danilowitz:
The second thing was him explaining to me something that frankly, we assume people know, but how do you ever know unless anybody tells you that there's actually lots of opportunity for you and you should seek it out? And the third thing was, what he was sort of highlighting was that he wasn't just treating me as somebody that did stuff, but he actually paid attention to what I did and how I did it, and let me know of all the great opportunities that were available to me.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it was a very large organization, but I think the point is I remember going home. I can almost see it and thinking to myself, "Holy cow, I had no idea that there was a whole career available to me." And that was really, I think the start of my career, despite having worked for a few years, that I actually took on more and more leadership roles, and took building my career seriously.

Barry Danilowitz:
But if he'd never had that to me, I don't know that I ever would've. And I talk to a lot of less senior people in the organization and I try and get to the point of having that conversation. And it's remarkable to me, how many people go, "Wow. I didn't know that," and they probably would've stayed in the same job for most of their career without ever having benefited themselves from a more diverse career, but also having the organization benefit from all that they have to offer.

Christine Laperriere:
Now, on that note, I'm just thinking about so many people that I work with, and maybe they're not best bosses, would love it if they would just stay. If they're competent, they're doing a great job in that existing role, isn't it beneficial for them to just go, "Great. I have one last position I have to worry about?"

Barry Danilowitz:
Christine, you are raising a really great point, and I think what's behind a lot of people's resistance to having that conversation, to saying to somebody, "You're awesome, but you need to move on," is precisely the reason you've mentioned, is that you've got somebody great, they're a high performer. You don't have to worry about them. It's one less job that you have to fill, and it's one less interview cycle, new hiring cycle that you need to go through, which let's face it, is work.

Barry Danilowitz:
But I think as leaders, we have a responsibility to let awesome people know how awesome they are, and to encourage them to seek out more and better opportunities, and grow and develop their careers. Again, not just for them. I think we have a moral responsibility to do that for them, but also to the organizations that we support. We want to get the best out of the people in the organization, and keeping them in a corner somewhere, doing a great job, but never having the opportunity to flourish, really doesn't benefit the organization either.

Christine Laperriere:
I just have a thought, a kind of an aha moment while you're saying this. And I thought, is there something to the fact that sometimes the best bosses who know how to encourage somebody to fly, even if it's not immediately convenient for them, because they're going to have to fill that role and coach somebody new, but if they are a best boss, maybe they have confidence and they enjoy that development of new people into their team?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that's also a great point. I think best bosses are people who like people, and people who like taking the opportunity to bring out the best in people. And I think that if you are the kind of person who takes joy in coaching and mentoring, and helping people realize how much value they bring to the organization, doing it with the same person day in, day out, year in, year out, you're not really going to satisfy that desire, but an opportunity to meet somebody new and help somebody new, grow somebody new is a wonderful part of having the responsibility of leadership in an organization.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's an aha moment. I'm just thinking to myself, of how many times you hear a similar theme in that best boss ever, as different people have worked with different leaders. And it always surprises me that people would prefer to coach somebody new and keep moving people up through the organization even if it means a bit more work for them, but if they enjoy it, then it's not that much work, right?

Barry Danilowitz:
Yes, exactly. And you can never be perfect at it. I think that's the thing, is there's always an opportunity to be better and do better. And again, if you're doing it with the same person day in and day out, you're not really getting that opportunity.

Barry Danilowitz:
The other early boss I thought about was perhaps a little bit later in my career, and again, a great boss. I was very happy to work for him and supportive, and encouraging, and very happy to see me grow and flourish. But the one thing that he did for me, that nobody else had until that particular point in my career was we'd just finished a presentation to a fairly senior group and I said, "How do you think that went?" And he said, "Good, clear messaging, articulate. You kind of waffled in the middle there."

Barry Danilowitz:
And it was a really great example of two things. One, it was honest feedback and it was delivered in the moment. And I think everybody, or a lot of people talk about the value of feedback, but it's amazing, as I have taken it more and more seriously to give people feedback, how many people say to me, "Wow. Nobody's ever actually given me honest feedback." I've had lots of people say, "Good job." I've had lots of people say, "Well done," but I've never actually had somebody do me the courtesy and the respect of giving me open, honest, constructive, of course.

Barry Danilowitz:
There's better and worse ways to deliver it, but open, honest feedback, and I think you're demonstrating that you care about the person's career. You're demonstrating that you care about the person's development, but you're also respecting them as an individual because that kind of feedback is very, very personalized most of the time.

Barry Danilowitz:
And of course, it has to be delivered in the moment, but it just opened my eyes to the... It stung a little bit initially, but of course, afterwards, I thought about it and thought, "You know what? He's right. I was waffling. That's the truth of the matter." And now I'm trying very carefully not to be a waffler.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it reminded me of a great coach I had one time, who said... because again, I think a lot of people talk about giving feedback, but very few people actually do it. She said, "It's better to give somebody a bad day than a bad career." And every time I hesitate to give somebody feedback and I think, "Oh, is this going to sting too much? Is this fair?" I think those words resonate in my head and I think, "Better for me to let them hear it." Take it or leave it, but at least I'm being honest, and at least I'm giving them the opportunity to do better and grow better.

Christine Laperriere:
That is such a good quote, especially given that I was thinking while you were talking. I thought, "Oh man, you must have heard that though, and went home that night." How did you feel that night when you got that piece of feedback?

Barry Danilowitz:
Well, it was a little bit of a double edged sword. I thought it's done because I think that presenting is one of the things I like to do. As part of a job, I like mentoring people and I like presenting. And so it hurt, but I played back the presentation in my mind, and I looked at the PowerPoint, and I thought, "You know what? There's definitely an opportunity for me to be a little crisper in my messaging, and not get too interested in the chatter, and not be too enthusiastic about showing how clever I am because that's not why we're here. And I'm not that clever. The point of this exercise is for me to quickly and efficiently get information across, and you know what? I didn't."

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny that you say that, because I immediately started thinking of some candid feedback that I was given throughout my career, and how transformative it really was to have a leader give me not just the, "Oh great job," but actually say, "You know what? Here's your opportunity." Those last with you. Those messages, they do make you better.

Barry Danilowitz:
They do, and they're rare, and there's no perfect person and no perfect employee. And unless somebody provides you that feedback, how are you going to know?

Christine Laperriere:
And then any other leaders that come to mind as you're thinking through this?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. A more recent leader I have had did a really interesting thing. Now, of course, in COVID times it's a little bit different, but whenever we met for a one-on-one, he always made a bit of a show of turning off his cell phone and turning it over, and putting it aside. It was his way of saying, "I am present. I am listening to you right now."

Barry Danilowitz:
And it's so important for leaders to be present, to listen carefully to what people are saying and what they're not saying, and to demonstrate that you care and you're interested. And it was a simple gesture, and I know it was hard to do. He's a very busy guy. It was a small gesture, but a very powerful one to demonstrate that, again, that he was interested, and that he cared, and that he was present. And being present in a one-on-one with somebody who you are responsible for managing is such an important part of the leadership experience.

Barry Danilowitz:
Now, of course, in COVID times, there're other ways you can do it. You can sit with your hands crossed on the screen and then clearly, you're not typing or looking at your phone. There're ways around it, but I thought it was quite a powerful gesture.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that. I feel like there're leaders that I work with that you benefit from that thinking about how's the ritual that you're going to use, that's going to really demonstrate your fullest attention as being given to somebody.

Barry Danilowitz:
Yes, everybody, all humans have a basic needs to be heard and seen and respected, and everybody understands that their leaders are busy, but it's so important to give people the time to listen to what they're saying, to listen to what they're not saying, if you really want to bring out the best in them.

Barry Danilowitz:
And that means being present and turning off your phone, and not looking at it or whatever else is going on your screen is a great way to convey that message.

Christine Laperriere:
It really demonstrates your commitment to them in that moment. That's excellent. Do you have any other stories or things that you were thinking about that you feel like you want to add to this?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think the one other thing that, that leader that I mentioned recently does is I think as part of leaders, a little bit of your job is to listen to people complain. It's inevitable and I always say, "Look, I'm happy to listen to your complaint, that's part of my job. My job is to help you, and if you need to vent, I'm here for you." And he does that and he did that, but I think the other interesting thing I did is he always presents the other side of the story, and there are always two sides to every story.

Barry Danilowitz:
I think we know that in the back of our minds, but he makes a very conscious effort of saying, "Well, maybe think about what this person is actually trying to do." And I think it does two things. It balances the thought by providing a little more context, because I think we all get very heads down and involved in what we do in our work. And we forget about how the work that we do exists in a much larger context, but it also serves as a good reminder that the work that you're doing is actually important as in, okay, you may be frustrated with this person, but remember, you're doing this thing to help this person with this other thing. And they have this other responsibility to these other people.

Barry Danilowitz:
And especially in a large organization where sometimes you feel like a little cog in a very big wheel. It's important to remind people that the work that they do is important, the work that they do matters, the work that they do has an impact to the larger organization and lots of other people because I think, again, is we have a little bit of a tendency to be a little bit inwardly focused, and he's really great at setting the larger stage, setting the larger context.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and that would be a powerful engagement tool. That would be really powerful because again, once it brings you back to what your bigger purpose is and how you're impacting things at a broader level that you can't see or remember sometimes, it would kind of fire you back up again, right?

Barry Danilowitz:
Absolutely, and I think it's interesting in our employee engagement survey, one of the questions goes something like, "Do you understand the connection of your work to the larger value of the organization?" I'm getting the words wrong, but the sentiment is something like that. And I put a lot of work into having that conversation with my direct reports and their direct reports, and so on, because I think especially as Technologists, you sort of forget the value of the work that you do and how it impacts your business partners, and the customers, and the stockholders, and all of the other people in the organization. It's often not obvious to people, how the work that they do connects.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I pay very careful attention to that score because it's surprising how often... People will do a great job, but you ask them why the work that they do is important to the larger organization, they often don't actually understand. And when you take the time to explain it to them, it has a very enthusing and empowering effect on people because they really understand why the work that they do is important. And the work that everybody does is important, but it's really important to make sure that people understand that.

Christine Laperriere:
And they remember it when they are frustrated. So I have a question for you, when you think of having worked for probably varying ranges, from a best boss, all the way down to maybe not a best boss. When you think of the impact to the bottom line, the difference between working for a best boss versus not, what's the impact to the business?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think the impact comes in many forms. Sometimes it's obvious in terms of increased cost or lost productivity. And maybe I'm a little bit biased here. I find in technology, you often meet incredibly smart people, like incredibly smart people, but if they don't understand... Again, if they don't understand the value of the work that they do, their level of engagement, the amount of effort that they're going to put into solving a problem is not going to be at the level that you need it.

Barry Danilowitz:
And if you want to get those really big brains fired up around solving problems, making things more efficient, delivering products more quickly, finding ways to do things more cheaply, if they're not in engaged and enthused, you're just not going to see the productivity and you're not going to see the engagement.

Barry Danilowitz:
And the thing is, I can't remember the expression, something about one bad apple, one bad apple spoils the batch or something. If you have one person in your team who has a bad attitude, it can pervade and poison the entire team. And it may be a very good person who just maybe doesn't understand the importance of the work that they're doing, or don't understand why they're being asked to do work in a certain way. And then it brings down their productivity, but also the entire team's productivity, and there's a cascading effect.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I think if people... I always think of the four Es, are people engaged, empowered, enthused, and enabled? And unless people have all those four things going on, the hits to the productivity of their team and their organization, and anybody else who they deals with, can have a real impact on the bottom line.

Christine Laperriere:
So now, being that you've been named best boss ever by one of your employees, can I ask you, what do you do when you have a bad apple though? Sure, you can inspire and coach, but just help me understand, how do you deal with that problem?

Barry Danilowitz:
It's not easy and it takes a lot of time. I think first and foremost is recognizing our common in humanity, and I think people often forget about that. They get too wrapped up in their position and how high they are in the organization, or not high they are in the organization, and don't always take the time to really understand a person and get to know a person.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I always like to start with just a human connection. You know what? You've got to find common ground with the person, don't talk about work. The obvious one is, "How is your weekend?" But really dig into the, "How is your weekend?" Not, "It was good." "Really? What did you do? Oh, okay. You went hiking. Where did you go hiking? Tell me more about the hike?" And just start by trying to build trust, which you do by building a bond, some commonality, and trying to find a way to connect on a very, very human level.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I think once people trust you, you get a little bit of a sense of why it is that they are frustrated. And sometimes it's something personal that they are not obliged to share, but you may get a little bit of a sense that there's something going on at home that's making life difficult for them.

Barry Danilowitz:
And often, you can help. Maybe they're shy to say, "Look, I really need to take every Friday afternoon off to take care of my sick mother," or something that they're perhaps not comfortable sharing. Getting to have that conversation and finding a way to say, "You know what? It's okay. I'm going to give you the time off because you are valued and valuable, and I want to bring out the best in you."

Barry Danilowitz:
The other thing is you may actually find out that they don't like another team member. And again, that's not something people are readily going to admit to, but if you develop that trust relationship and say, "Look, I'm not going to tell, but you're clearly unhappy. What's going on? And I care. I care to know why it is that you're unhappy."

Barry Danilowitz:
Or the other interesting one is sometimes they just don't buy the project. They don't understand why they're doing what they're being asked to do, and all too often, we ask people to do things without taking the time to explain to them why it's important. And sometimes you can have a real transformative conversation with somebody to say, "Look, I know this might seem like an overly complicated project, or maybe you don't understand the product, but here's why this is important to our business partner."

Barry Danilowitz:
And there can be a real light going on, and let's face it, when you give somebody a project assignment, we don't always spend perhaps enough time as we should explaining the wheres and the whys, and the why fors, but sometimes it can really make a difference to people. So it's worth exploring, "Do you understand why you're being asked to do what you're you're doing?"

Barry Danilowitz:
And then the other one is sometimes, and this is always so sad, you come across people who are just in the wrong job. All right. They've been bumped around or they got assigned this, or somebody left and they were asked to do that. And so, they've continued doing it for the last three or four months, or years, and they're just in the wrong job. And it's the responsibility of the leader to find out what it is that they're more interested in, and get them doing something that is actually interesting to them, and that comes to the, are they engaged and enthused?

Barry Danilowitz:
If people aren't engaged and enthused, they're not going to do a good job, and nor would I expect them to.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that is excellent. And that point about a wrong job, I think of my own detour into marketing, which I'm not meant to be in marketing. I've found out, but I didn't work with anybody in that moment who was able to go, "You were extremely successful in these three roles, and then you ended up in a role that wasn't..." It wasn't about success so much as it was, "You weren't happy anymore. You didn't have the enthusiasm." It was one of the four years that you mentioned, but it changed, something shifted because that was not the same.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, I think that point about the wrong job, I see that unfortunately in bigger organizations where people get promoted and they move and they move. And then all of a sudden, they end up in a position where they're just like, "This isn't my happy place. I was so successful, and now I ended up here."

Christine Laperriere:
Sometimes they just leave the organization because they feel at this point that their leader is not... they're not looking for that next job for them though. They're not looking for what would be more exciting for them.

Barry Danilowitz:
Which is so unfortunate, because in many cases, they're really good people with a lot to offer. People say, "You should find your jam or find your bliss," and you should, but your leader has a responsibility to make sure that you are engaged and enthused, and sometimes asking a couple of probing questions to get to that point. And you can't always solve it right away, but at least, "Okay, let's acknowledge that this is not the best fit for you. There are many other wonderful things that you can do for the organization. I can't make a change right now, but let's work towards it together." And just that alone can have a difference for people.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, yeah. And a great leader can observe what that person is strong at. So when you are in the wrong job, you're not feeling very strong, but a great leader can say, "I do see your capability here, your capability there." And so they can even help provide the advocacy for what you're great at.

Barry Danilowitz:
Yeah, exactly. But it has to be a conversation and somebody has to care enough to have the conversation.

Christine Laperriere:
And I think that's the essence of some of the things I keep hearing, and the way that you're explaining those best bosses, is that they cared enough. They kept coming back to, "I care about you enough that I'm willing to have the hard conversation. I'm willing to talk about the tough feedback, or I'm willing to talk your way through a wrong job, but I care enough about you, that I'm going to help you get through that next step."

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that's exactly right.

Christine Laperriere:
So I have one question for you as well. When you think of a not great boss, what's the difference in approach that creates that, or at least in your experience?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think two things come to mind. One is it's important for leaders to remember that they set the tone. And when I think of a boss who wasn't great, super smart guy, I definitely learned a lot, probably how to be more Machiavellian than not, maybe not a great skill. But the thing that I recall is a very sour attitude that pervaded the entire team, and it's important to remember to set the tone from the top.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it doesn't matter where you are in the organization. If you have people reporting to you, you have a responsibility to set a positive, productive tone, and everybody in the team had that attitude. And I've noticed as I encounter teams where there's a little bit of a negative attitude, nine times out of 10, whoever leads that team has a negative attitude, because people hire in their own image, but people also take their cue about how to behave from their boss.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I think when I think about what was bad about that situation was a very negative attitude that included making disparaging comments about others. And I thought, "Well, if he's making disparaging comments about others, what kind of comments is he making about me or the rest of the team?"

Barry Danilowitz:
It creates an unease, and perhaps a little bit of distrust, and words are powerful and words matter. And as leaders, you have a responsibility to set the right tone.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that makes so much sense to me. And those, like you said, the remarks you make about other people, sometimes leaders think that, that's a way of bonding, but ironically, it's actually extremely the opposite. It usually just creates like a massive amount of distrust. When they walk out of the room, it's like, "Now what's being said about me?"

Christine Laperriere:
I obviously work with a lot of leaders who are on their way or aspiring to be best bosses ever. So I just have any tips, wisdom, what would you really encourage people to think about or focus on as they're aspiring to be fantastic?

Barry Danilowitz:
I have a sticky in front of me on the four E's I mentioned. Is everybody engaged? Do they understand the value of what they're doing? Do they understand the value of what they're doing to the larger organization? So are they engaged? Are they empowered? Do they know that I trust them? Do they know that they have the right to make decisions? Do they know that I have them on the team because I think they're awesome? Does everybody understand that? Are they enthused? Do they care about the work that they're doing? Are they in the right job? Are they working well with the rest of the team?

Barry Danilowitz:
Finally, enabled, which is a very simple one, but do they have a computer that works? The number of times people say, "Oh, my laptop keeps crashing." Get a new one, but people are shy or they don't want to ask, or they think it's a problem. And I think simple things like that makes a really big difference.

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that have the courage to provide the honest feedback. It's so hard, but you'll just be astonished at how much people appreciate somebody taking the time to give them honest feedback, and it needs to be delivered in the right way and sensitively. But even if it's going to sting, just remember that it's better to give somebody a bad day than a bad career.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it's remarkable how often people will say, "Gosh, nobody's ever given me that kind of feedback before." Remember your impact. Remember that words matter and words are powerful, but also remember the great quote from Maya Angelou, "People may not remember what you say, but they will certainly remember how you made them feel." And that I think goes to the point of setting a positive tone. Even in a difficult situation, you can set a positive tone, but remember that as a leader, your team is looking to you and will take their cue from you, how to treat others and how they perceive their value is going to be very much reflection of how you talk to them.

Barry Danilowitz:
So take the time to get to know people. There are so many wonderfully interesting, super, super smart people out there, that if you just take the time to get to know them a little bit better, first of all, you'll learn something, but also, it's a way to get the best out of people. I always say most of the people that work for me will forget more than I'll ever know, but at least I can find a way to get them to deliver the value that they have to the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
When you think of getting to know people, I can just feel how that's a strength of yours, do you have any kind of tactical tips too? Just when you think of some people are more introverted and it's not as intuitive, or maybe they're working with a team that's a little more closed off, maybe from a previous leader. Help me think of how do you get there?

Barry Danilowitz:
It's a hard one because you're right. A lot of people are shy and a lot of people aren't used to leaders engaging on that level. I think I'll go back to what I said earlier, remember your common humanity. We may be at different levels in the organization and we do what we do at different kinds of organizations, but the end of the day, we're all human beings and we all have the same needs and desires, wishes, hopes, dreams, and fears, and just starting, going in with that recognition and asking questions, again, "Wow was your weekend?" "Good." "Why? What did you do this weekend?"

Barry Danilowitz:
Or, "Do you have any vacation plans? Or have you read any good books lately?" "No, I haven't written. I don't read." "Okay. What do you do?" "I like to watch TV." "What's your favorite TV...?" There are a 1,000,000 questions that you can ask, and the question isn't the important thing, right? It's what you learn about people's interests. What they like, what they don't like. There's always another question you can ask.

Barry Danilowitz:
I'm not a huge sports fan, and so I'm always challenged when people say, "Oh, I went to a ball game." "Okay. Who played? Where did they play? How are they doing in the league?" The fact that you're asking the questions, you'll get through the basic questions, but very quickly, you'll get to a very human conversation where you're going to find something in common, and you start there, and it only gets better from there.

Barry Danilowitz:
And some people, right away, they'll click and they'll realize that you really are just interested in getting to know them. And some people, you have to do it a few times, but it is so worth it, and it always pays off in the end.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is a great reminder for everybody out there listening, and in the world of COVID and now us working on Zoom, I know we have to be even more intentional sometimes about what you're talking about, where you have to make the time because we get onto our Zoom calls and it's like, we know the agenda of the meeting, tick, tock, let's go.

Christine Laperriere:
People are having to learn how to slow down and take five minutes of even what feels like an important meeting, to rapport build in order to build that connection.

Barry Danilowitz:
Absolutely. Absolutely. Again, we can't forget our common humanity and it's a starting place for all great relationships and communication.

Christine Laperriere:
Barry, I really enjoyed this interview. It has been fantastic. Thank you so much for all the tips.

Barry Danilowitz:
Oh, thank you. It's been great. It's great talking to you. Your passion around this topic is very inspiring.

Episode: 21
Title: Breaking the rules
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Rob Hartnett

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelapperiere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. Today. I have Rob Hartnett with me and I am thrilled that he took the opportunity to come on my show. And just before I get started, I'm going to tell you a little bit about how I know Rob. So Rob and I both were independent sales consultants when we worked for Miller Heiman. We were doing sales transformation work all over the world, actually. And one of the things that was so neat is we went to one of our annual sales conferences and Rob was the top performer that year. And he was celebrated as having the best performance and the best accomplishments.

Christine Laperriere:
And one of the things that I loved seeing is just kind of the natural, people-centric, high energy, motivating excitement you brought that year to the event. Instead of it being all about you, you really made it all about everyone and you really celebrated everybody in the organization that year. So I was part of your fan club then, I'm still your fan club now. And since you've gone on to do some amazing things, some independent things, you've written a book, It's All Possible, you've led the It's All Possible podcast, which I'm going to be a guest on soon. Rob, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Rob Hartnett:
Absolute delight, Christine. Absolute delight.

Christine Laperriere:
And anything you want to just share with us about how people can find if they love what you have to say today.

Rob Hartnett:
For sure. So you just mentioned the podcast which I do, the It's All Possible podcast on Apple and Spotify and on the C-Suite Network. You can also find me at my business, which is Proteus Leadership. So I'm one of the team at proteusleadership.com based in Melbourne, Australia. So that's the best way to find me. I'm on all socials. I'm not hard to find so just @robhartnett is the easiest way to do it.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm going to dive in with the question of the day, who is your best boss ever, and why? Tell us all about him.

Rob Hartnett:
I really struggled with the question. I'm simple. I'm from Australia. No, I'm kidding. I really struggle with it because I've had so many great leaders. I really have. And I have had so many great leaders and I really struggled with so many. But I did pick one. But is it okay if I mention a few and then I'll get to the one?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Rob Hartnett:
I find there's so many great leaders because I look for the best in everybody and I find you can learn from everybody. And I've learned so much from so many through my career at different stages at the right times. Clearly one that you and I worked with, he wasn't our direct boss, but to me, he was a boss. And that was Sam Reese, the CEO of Miller Heiman, and the other CEO at Vistage. And Sam and I still keep in touch. He's still unbelievable. He was on my podcast last year. So Sam to me was a great leader. I also work for a guy called Steve Vamos, who was the head of country for Apple when I was at Apple in Australia. And Steve is now the CEO of Xero with the great accounting software business. At HP, I had so many. Lew Platt who was the global president and chairman and everything. And I did have some interactions with Lew and I really enjoyed Lew's abilities to communicate to 145,000 employees. It was something that I rarely see even today.

Rob Hartnett:
And two other Australian-based leaders, John Bieske and Bruce Thompson who were the Australian-based leaders at HP. Andrew Carter and Paul Royce in my computing days when I was an IT reseller. They ran a very hard, tough, competitive business, but I learned so much from them. Tim Nicole Jones, who led me at the ad agency Mojo. You didn't have this in here, but I thought I'd put it in. I won a world yachting championship in 1994 and sailing with the great American Ken Reid. And Ken's a six time world champion, president of north sales. He's just an amazing lead. He's a personal friend. Ken, certainly he taught me a lot and I still use his leadership techniques when I'm talking to people today. That's kind of a list. I hope that was okay.

Christine Laperriere:
I have to tell you something really side note. So ever since I started doing the show, I love talking to people about their best boss ever. And what I will say is that it's always unfortunate how many people can only recall stories from their worst boss, but it's very hard for them to scale back and think about where their best bosses might have been. And so I'm listening to that company list, first of all. So those are some great organizations and it actually brings me a lot of hope just to hear that you actually have such a long list of great leaders.

Rob Hartnett:
And some of those leaders like for example, Sam, now CEO of Vistage, Steve Vamos, who is head of country at Apple is now CEO globally of Xero. He was a board member of Telstra and many others and head of Microsoft out here. And so what I find is that the good leaders, if you follow them, you'll see they've got a trajectory. It's not that they don't make mistakes. Sam was incredibly candid with me on my podcast, he said some things I didn't think Sam would say. It was really exciting because he's authentic. So I think you got to look for it though, Christine. I think it's really easy to find the faults in people. We all make mistakes. None of us are perfect. I know you are, but I'm not. You are perfect. We all make mistakes, so I think I like to just look for the best. But I did pick one. Do you want me to talk about the one I picked?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Tell us a little bit more about them.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. So the guy I picked for this one, and I said there was so many. But a guy by the name of Kim Hamilton. Kim Hamilton was my boss at HP. He brought me into HP and was my boss there when I was running emerging products. So I came from Apple into HP. The reason I put on Kim is that he was a kind of a low key leader. And what I mean by that was he really empowered people and he built non-dependent empowered teams, which I think is the real game for leaders today. If you're a leader and you are complaining, everyone's coming to you and winking to you and you've got problems you're solving and you're really working all these hours, that's on you because you've built a team of people who are dependent on you. And Kim did, was coming from Toshiba into HP, which was very interesting because HP had a lot of people they had just basically promoted internally because it was such a great company.

Rob Hartnett:
And Kim came in from Toshiba and he realized that they needed someone different to run emerging products. This is the newer products that were coming to market. You'll laugh when I say this, but one of my emerging products I ran was color printing. We're going back mid-90s.

Christine Laperriere:
You're dating yourself now. Yes.

Rob Hartnett:
I'm dating myself. But there was also a whole bunch of other products I had. And they wanted someone different. And so he fought for me. And I came from Apple. In Apple, we were evangelists for innovators. We're always the underdog. So he needed that kind of spirit. And so Kim fought for me and I remember the interviews I had at HP. And the first interview I went there and I just wanted to be there. I just wanted to join HP so bad. And they kind were a bit edgy with me. And [inaudible 00:06:30] was my greatest reference who I thought it would be my golden reference. Basically told them, "He won't last there because you guys are too slow for him." I'm like, "Thank you. That not exactly what I want you to say." But to his point. And so I remember Kim really fighting for me. And Kim saying, "Look, can you come back? I've got one more interview with John Bieske." who was the head of Australia at the time.

Rob Hartnett:
And I came back in and I sat there with John and John and Kim were there and John was running it. And John just said, "I'm just not sure Rob, I'm just not sure you'd be able to fit into the culture here. I don't think you'd fit the culture. I think you're really nice. I think you have a great record but I just don't think HP's the place for you." And I was so devastated. And then Kim kind of jumped in and he let me tell my story. And at the end of it before I was going, I said to John, "John, I really appreciate your view and the whole thing, but I'm coming here one day." And John turned around to Kim and he said, "Fetch your attitude Hartnett, you can come now." That was so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great.

Rob Hartnett:
It was Kim fighting for me. And then when I had to do a lot of things, I had to break a lot of rules at HP or establish things like we've always done it this way here, Kim would back me. And I think it's so important as a leader, he would back me. He would go, "Yep. That's fine now, I'm backing Rob." And Christine, you'll love this little story. When I went to HP, HP used has to have fleets of cars, all GM cars. So the car park at HP and Melbourne was full of GM cars, all these General Motors cars because we all bought them on the lease for the salary plan. I was driving a Porsche 911. That was my car.

Christine Laperriere:
Breaking the rules.

Rob Hartnett:
Because at Apple, that was almost the standard car, like four or five of us had Porsches. So I've come with my 911 and it was this hot car. It was so loud, it used to set off car alarms and the GM cars. And then someone went and complained. A leader behind my back came and complained to Kim and said, "Hey, who's this guy you've hired? How much money are you paying him? He's driving a fricking Porsche 911." And you know what Kim said? Kim said to this guy, this leader, a peer of Kim's. He said, "Yeah. It's good. We're all getting them."

Christine Laperriere:
Nice.

Rob Hartnett:
He joined my team. So at every point, even with a sense of humor, he had your back. And he empowered me. He empowered my team. He allowed me to bring on people who allowed me to cut through red tape and really transform, and with John's support. But Kim was just an amazing leader, backed me in so many ways. And when I went on to my next role to head up the personal computer business in HP, Kim was my biggest supporter.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's such a good example, that point about being able to cut through red tape and break rules. I'm working with a client today who was just talking about being an entrepreneur and we were kind of comparing notes. And he said, "I worked for Chrysler and I didn't feel supported in being an entrepreneur. I actually am much more supported as an external resource to businesses who ask me for all of that difficult, out of the box thinking because when I'm in the doors of the company, they don't appreciate it." They're like, "We wish you'd go away now."

Rob Hartnett:
And you're you're right. And it depends on the company. And certainly when I came from Apple, innovation was such a part of what we did and creative thinking and out of the box thinking was such a great place to be. So coming to HP, that was not what they normally did, but we did it. And I remember once I did a competition. So I had to get these particular devices really selling fast. And so what I did was I put together this competition. And the competition was based around sales of course, based around sales and volume and sell through. But I was going to reward the top sellers. Now typically, the sellers I was talking about for this product were in retail so they were between the ages about sort of 19 and 23.

Rob Hartnett:
I said, "I'm going to fly you to Melbourne." which many of them hadn't even been to. "I'm going to put you up at a five-star hotel. I'm going to take you to dinner. And we're going to go down the river by boat to see AC/DC in concert and you've got great tickets." Now, when I launched this, it didn't take off. I thought this was the most amazing package. It didn't take off. It was like a three-month campaign. The first month it was dead. I rang around a few of the dealers who work with HP and I said, "Are you getting behind this?" And they go, "Is it real? This is so un-HP. We have never done it. It's bullshit."

Christine Laperriere:
There you go. There's two out of the-

Rob Hartnett:
"Welcome to the party, my friend." And once I got that one over the line, oh my God, it was game on. But they just didn't do that kind of stuff. And even though John and Kim had backed me, the reaction from the channel was like, "Oh no, I'd say it's boring. We might go and see Mozart, we might go to the opera. AC/DC, for like 18 and 20 year olds?" They would've had such a great time.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic. I love that story. That is a great story. Any others from some of the bosses that you've worked for? So you had such an incredible list. I love the examples that you're telling though. These are great.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. I'll talk about Lew Platt. He's passed away now, but Lew was an amazing leader. As I said to you, one of the things that's amazing about Lew was he had staff of 145,000. And remember this is the days before Teams and Slack and all these kind of tools. But I knew. I was in Blackburn in Melbourne, Australia, and I knew exactly what Lew was thinking. Why? Because every month Lew would make a call. He would do a call where he would address everybody. And everyone just put the phones down, put the email down, and we listened to Lew for 45 minutes of where he was taking the business. And at one point, I just got so connected with where he was going and I'd read Forbes magazine and I'd read all these different magazines, also about HP and about Lew and all the big companies.

Rob Hartnett:
And I was a huge provider with Intel because I sold a lot of Intel PCs and I was head of PCs at the time. And I remember being at a Gartner conference and there was a whole lot of rumors around. What had happened, Lew had been at a Gartner conference, I think in Italy, and was on his flight back to the US. And he'd said something. And he was a very off the cuff, authentic leader. And they'd misinterpret it and made this kind of really big headline. And I saw it and I went, "Oh my God, there's a Gartner conference happening in Australia. They might say something about HP." So I said to my colleagues, "I'm going to email Lew and let him know that this has been misinterpreted so when he lands in the US, he'll understand it." And I just got laughed at, honestly, Christine.

Rob Hartnett:
People said, "You want to email Lew Platt? Good on you." You know what Australians can be like, pretty sarcastic. "Yeah. Get on, mate. You may have a go at that one. Yeah. Call Lew." So I literally emailed Lew and said, Lew, I read this. I met a guy at a conference in Brisbane. He wanted me to say anything else because I'm going to be on stage. I was actually on a panel. If it comes up, I just want to let you know this how the press has interpreted it." That was it. I left it. I didn't know. Next morning, 8:00 AM. "Hi, Rob. Lew here. Thanks so much for letting me know. I made it kind of a boo-boo in Italy. I didn't mean to say what I said. They misinterpreted it by the time I was on the flight. Thank you for picking it up and working the time zones for me. Here's the paragraph to use if it comes into question. Thank you so much. Lew Platt.

Rob Hartnett:
I literally printed that out and just walked around there the office for like an hour with a badge. But you know what? The thing about that, Christine, was me reaching out to Lew on that and him coming back authentically. And it was him, not his EA. But it made such a difference because about 12 months later, I realized, not only me, but my team and I realized that we needed to build a factory in Australia to build HP PCs. And guess who's approval we needed?

Christine Laperriere:
Lew's.

Rob Hartnett:
We needed Lew's. And Lew came out and opened it for us. And when he came to Australia and he met me, he knew. And it was 12 months ago. He knew we'd had that connection. And it made such a difference, I think, to getting it approved for the first time. And secondly, him coming out with his wife to open up the new factory in Australia. And so I think if you reach out to leaders... I was generally doing it from a place of care and empathy because I've had myself misquoted in press. You probably have had something similar too. But I could see the position that it could cause. And of course, HP is a public company. It's a big deal for a lot of people. And it was simply a misinterpretation. So I love what he did in that area.

Rob Hartnett:
John Bieske, who was a leader in Australia for a long, long time of all the personal computer business and so much business. He was there for many, many years. What I love about John, as I said to you, when I left HP, John and I left about the same time, although he'd been there some 25 years or something. When I was leaving HP, John saw me and he said, "Rob, the day you came and you first joined us, I said to myself, and I said to Kim, your boss, 'Don't worry. He'll come along but we'll change him. We'll get him to fit.' You know what? You changed us."

Christine Laperriere:
I love hearing that. That's powerful.

Rob Hartnett:
And when you have a leader, he doesn't have to say that. And John would write Christmas cards to everyone of his staff every year personally and hand them out. It must have been like 350, but he would do them. That was what John did. He knew everybody. He knew everybody's name. So people like that, Bruce Thompson, who was his leader, was very similar in many ways as well. They empowered people. They backed people. They trusted people. So they were to me, very authentic leaders, very approachable leaders. But also importantly, they were leaders who did two things that I teach people every week to do.

Rob Hartnett:
I teach new emerging leaders every week to do. They catch the good stuff and they call out the bad stuff and they do it early. They catch the good stuff early. They encourage you. They thank you. They recognize improvement. They do it. They don't walk past it. They don't forget about it. And the other thing they do is they'll call out bad behavior if they see it. And that doesn't mean the person's bad. It just means it's not aligned to what we're doing. It's not what we do around here. It's affecting the rest of your team. Whether that's me or anybody else, they would call it out and say, "No, you can't say that." or "You can't do that." or whatever it happens to be. You'll find the best leaders in the world will do that. They'll catch the good stuff. They'll call out the bad stuff and they know when they're doing it.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And so I find it interesting that both of us made the leap from sales transformation to leadership transformation. And so even though this question's not necessary early on script, I'm curious for you why that transition for you? I know why I transitioned.

Rob Hartnett:
Well, for me, I'd say it was simple, but it's not. It took a lot of time to work it out. And it was really through my work at Miller Heiman Group and when I was involved in the large transformations and mid-size transformations and small transformations. So whether they were small, large, global, so we worked on some big ones, you and I worked on some very large transformations. And people would come to me for the next one and go, "Rob, what's the secret source to making sure it works, it sticks, it's adaptable, it keeps on going. What is the secret source?" And I really got it down to three things, Christine and I still believe in those three things. The three things are leadership, accountability and discipline. And if any one of those three is missing, it will fall over or it will be short-lived.

Rob Hartnett:
Once I looked at that and I came back to going, you know what, but it's the leader who really drives the accountability and the discipline and is the leadership and management coming together. Leadership gets you going and management keeps you going. So when I looked at that, it starts with leadership. So to me, when I looked at what I was doing in the sales space, I thought there's more I can do here. And I have a passion for leadership. I love leadership. I love seeing it. I love seeing leaders lead. I see leaders grow, and I love it. And you're probably the same, but I've had a number of people who work for me still write to me and go, "Thank you for impacting me. Thank you for where I am now."

Rob Hartnett:
And they're in great positions and I love it. I love seeing LinkedIn profile and they're going to some huge role and you had something to do with that hopefully somewhere along the line. That's why I wanted to get into leadership because I could impact. And I think I was starting with John Maxwell and John Maxwell said this. He said, "The more leaders you can impact is the more people you'll impact." And that's where it was the catalyst for me. How do I get scale in this? The more leaders I can impact, the more people I can impact that we have more transformational leaders who lead with kindness and with empathy and understanding, and that's okay. And you realize you don't have to be this authority of my way or the highway, highly directed, don't know how to spell diversity type person, then we don't need that.

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny that you say that. We're so aligned in that. I used to see huge transformation projects. And just like you said, it was really reliant on the leader, but it was also reliant on how much people wanted to follow that leader because lots of leaders can come in and say, "Okay, everybody, scoot over. We have the big change." or "We have the next big assignment." But if people weren't engaged and bought in, it was just a long, miserable, frustrating process. So as an outsider, I had very little to do, ironically, with which ones were successful. It was usually if I could align with a fantastic leader who had, just like you said, some of these qualities, I just find those changes would go so well and I just got to be there and cheer it on.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. And it's so much easier for you and so much easier for the team to have those transformational leaders who are willing to do that. And luckily, I've been able to work with a number of those really good leaders and they would be fantastic catalysts to me too, because when we came to doing big change, I'd say, "Would you be happy to talk to this particular client who's looking to do this similar thing?" I can't tell you how many. I remember one, a major bank. And I spoke to this guy who's very successful in financial services. And they said, "Sounds like a lot of hard work. He was actually telling us about all the hard stuff we've got to do."

Rob Hartnett:
And I'm like, "Well, it's kind of why I got him to talk to you." "Yeah. But he was really saying there's a lot of stuff to do and can take a while and we're not so sure that we really want to do this." And I said, "Well, good, because you're not going to waste my time or anybody else's. So you need to understand going from A to B is not as simple, is not a straight line. And I could set you up for success, but you've got to want to put in the effort."

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You don't want to be living through those types of transformations and having your name attached to them. They're brutal.

Rob Hartnett:
Yes. You know it's just going to go south really fast.

Christine Laperriere:
So one of the questions that I love to ask, and I think I'm really curious about your answer on this. What do you think the impact is to the bottom line of working for a best boss ever?

Rob Hartnett:
In my experience, it's been massive. And again, I think not only bottom line, I think there's bottom line, but also for me, what I've seen working for a best boss ever has been an increase in things like customer set, increase in employee retention, increase in innovation, employee satisfaction themselves, culture. If you do a culture pulse, it's always good and getting better. But absolutely. If I look at one, just to give an example of this and I can't work the numbers out, but one of the other best boss ever I worked for was a guy called Anthony McMan. And Anthony and I were the ones who pulled the PC business together. But Anthony was my boss, but Anthony was so, so sharp. He spent many, many years as a very senior leader at SAP after HP.

Rob Hartnett:
But Anthony pulled together a team and knew the strengths of all of us. He knew my strength was in the inspirational or empowerment, getting everyone on board, getting the team together, getting our channel members to follow us, to build these programs. Anthony was about tasks and projects and pulling the team together. He knew where his strengths were. He was great as strategic leader. He was great at stakeholder management. And he just pulled a fantastic team together. And that allowed us to do what we do now. Here's what we did. We took HP PCs. This is to give an idea on metrics, from number 17 in the country in Australia to number one in under 18 months. Now you work the metrics on volume of shipping of product. Now you talk about bottom line. We dramatically changed the bottom line. We got recognized right around the world for what we did.

Rob Hartnett:
I won a HP high achiever award for it, which was kind of embarrassing, because it was so many people involved. But you know what we also did? We grew our channel members, so the channel members who sold our product, who hung with us for so long when we were 15 and 16 and we took them to number one. The volume they did, the families that we made wealthy, the kids we put through private schools, that's bottom line for me. That's what we did. We did a good bottom line at HP. We affected so many more people.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. Great story. That is amazing. If you had to sum it up, what advice would you say to any of the leaders that are listening to the show that are trying to become a best boss ever? What would be your pieces of wisdom for them?

Rob Hartnett:
It's funny I got asked this question by a leader this week so it was great prep although I didn't know you were going to ask it. I think the number one thing in this day and age, because we are coming through a pandemic, we're coming out the other end. I'm in Melbourne. If you don't know, we've been the most locked down city in the world past bonus areas about three weeks ago. We're world champions, Christine. We're very happy about... No, we're not.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. Winning the COVID award.

Rob Hartnett:
Winning the COVID award. I'm putting this in context. So the number one thing in any case, but I think more so now, is create a culture of psychological safety. If you haven't got psychological safety, you will not have any innovation. Andy Stanley says a great quote. And he says, "Leaders who aren't prepared to listen will be surrounded by people with nothing to say." If you have psychological safety, you'll have innovation. You'll have diversity. You'll have great ideas. You'll have people coming to you. You'll have people who are empowered and non-dependent right. So I think that's for me, because psychological safety is so important. And that means reaching out to your people. That means your people need your visibility, not your great vision right now. So connect with your people, making sure they feel comfortable. Are the ideas coming? If they're not coming and everyone's going quiet, what's going on.

Rob Hartnett:
So that's the first one. So psychological safety for me. Have that kind of culture of innovation and ideas. It doesn't matter how big your group is or how small your group is. A really great leader told me a good story he did when he was driving up startups, he was a serial entrepreneur. And one of the things they used to do was weekly failure meetings. So every Friday, you had to bring along something that you failed at that week, but you learnt from. And no one could come without it. You couldn't come along and laugh at me, Christine. You can't say, "Rob, you're an idiot." but you didn't do anything. So everyone came to the meeting and you had to come with what did you do this week?

Rob Hartnett:
And it could be, "I sent a direct mail out. It just didn't work. I tried something on social media and it didn't work. We did a TikTok video and it did work." You had to come along with something you tried that was different, but didn't work. And it's the fastest way to test. Do we have a culture of innovation? Do we feel psychologically safe? Now another colleague of mine... Funny enough, another guy on a podcast earlier told me a great story. When he tried this whole idea, he came in to talk about not value meetings, just where were we up to of all our projects. Tell us everything. He went around the room and I said, "How did that go?" And he said, "Dismal. No one volunteered anything." And then he said, "So I closed the meeting down in 15 minutes. And I went around and in my discovery and said, "Why wouldn't you prepare to share?"

Rob Hartnett:
And they said, "Well, we only share our outcomes at the end and we're halfway through and it's not going so well. And we don't want to tell anybody that." And he realized straight away these people are not psychologically safe. This environment, I have to change that up. So as a leader, he brought that on himself and he said, "No, I want to go under the hood. I want to know what the problems are." And again, first thing modeled the way. It's the number one thing from [inaudible 00:24:58] and the leadership challenges model the way. First thing he did was go, "Hey, this is where I failed. Guys, this is the project I'm working on, it's not going well. I thought I'd be going a lot better. I'm missing target." So one, model away. Secondly, psychological safety. And really work on this whole thing of non-dependent, empowered, effective people. Great leaders create more leaders.

Rob Hartnett:
If you actually think about that, if you think about all the best boss ever you probably heard on your program or spoken to, they will have created more leaders. How do you more leaders? And the way you do that is who's replacing you? So you're a leader, who's replacing you? Is it anyone in your team or are you going to go, "God, no, why would any of these people take my job? Well, then I'd have a serious think about how you answered that because you are going to be stuck in that job forever. So who's your next replacement? And when you are recruiting your next team member, would there be someone you'd be happy to hand the reins over to?

Christine Laperriere:
Those are some fantastic words of wisdom. So all I can say is thank you so much for being on the show.

Rob Hartnett:
Hey, it's been fantastic, Christine. It's so good to connect with you again, really liked it.

Title: Lead yourself first
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Kim Fletcher

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at ChristineLaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere. Today, I've invited Kim Fletcher to come on the show and talk to us about her best boss. And a little bit about Kim, real quick. I've had the opportunity to work with her when she was a leader at KPMG and now as she's a leader at World Vision. One of the things I like about Kim is she's a very values based leader. I really appreciate that about the way that she thinks about the world and she thinks about the bigger picture. And then she leads her team to success. So I'm very thankful I've had the opportunity to work with you quite a few times now, Kim. And I'm so glad you're on the show. Thanks for joining me.

Kim Fletcher:
Oh, Christine. Thank you for having me. It's a delight to have worked with you for probably about 10 years now.

Christine Laperriere:
Can't believe we're getting that young. So Kim, just as we're getting started, your role at World Vision today is?

Kim Fletcher:
I'm Vice President of Philanthropy and Partnerships. It's basically a marketing role, but focused in on fundraising.

Christine Laperriere:
Beautiful. So when I asked you to be on the show, it sounded like someone came to mind. So who is your best boss ever?

Kim Fletcher:
Oh, thank you, Christine. I think you said once a best boss is someone, whoever forever impacts you for the better. And that made me think of my first boss. She led a manufacturing business, she was also the VP of sales and I was on her marketing team, my very first job. Looking back, I would characterize her as a servant leader. Though, back then, I hadn't heard that way of describing a corporate leader, so it was new for me. But true to being a servant leader, she really set the vision, she said our direction, our goals. And she saw it as her responsibility to make sure that we were all super clear on how these vision, directions and goals related to our roles. But that was the extent of her hierarchy.

Kim Fletcher:
After that, she really turned the traditional hierarchy pyramid upside down. She led from the ground up, serving us as her team. We felt included and listened to, all ideas were welcome. And whenever we needed help, she was really there to unblock our barriers. And one of the things that impressed me as young in my career was she visibly set time in her calendar to be available for coaching us and to support us. She was very results orientated, but that meant she still put people ahead of results, no matter what. And as a result, we really became this high morale team. We had high performance metrics and I learned from her something that I've taken with me forever. And that is, leadership is something leaders do alongside people and they don't do it from a distance.

Kim Fletcher:
And one story that came to mind was that she was designing a new product. And she wanted everyone from the plant production team to the marketing and sales team to provide ideas on the product features and the launch. It was her vision that when we launched this, customers would say, "Yes, this new product helps me where others products don't." To be authentic to what customer pain points our customers were having. She loaded everyone up on two big coach buses and we drove to the state, took about three or four hours. And then she divided us into small groups where we had permission to walk the entire customer operations. And we had one question to ask, and that was, how can we help you?

Kim Fletcher:
Well, Christine, we launched more than just a new product from this trip. We re-imagined everything from our shipping container labels to our quality control reports, to even how we put language and images and instructions in our sales collateral. And that to me, was an amazing insight in terms of what it is to be a servant leader. To really go out and serve your customers, but really serve your staff, as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So that's so interesting. So everybody went on this, so two full bus fulls of people. So who's going with it? Is it the whole sales team, marketing team, everybody?

Kim Fletcher:
Even people who were on the lines, making the product. Because one of the things she believed was that if we had a deeper insight of what our customers are doing with our products, even the production line folks would make the products slightly different. They would come away with insights on how we could change the features to better serve our customers.

Kim Fletcher:
And that's how we found out, for instance, at the warehouse of the customers, that how we were sending our products, our shipping labels just weren't helpful of them to know what was the freshest product or if there was a different variation. And that really was insight that made them go back as a production team, they would never have been involved in that conversation. And the customer shipping team said, what an amazing help that small change was in addition to the new product. That alone was worth the whole trip for us coming. And we would never have been on that if she hadn't packed us up and taken us.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. You hear the metaphor all the time, getting everyone on the bus. And this is so literal.

Kim Fletcher:
So very literal. And it was a wonderful way for us to bond as a team. Three or four hours on a bus with your peers that you may not see in different plants is an opportunity to share your own stories and your life, and to really get to know people as people.

Christine Laperriere:
This is excellent. So what other stories come to mind when you think of that leader? And I love this servant leadership principle. So, what else did you see her do?

Kim Fletcher:
Well, my best boss was a former elite athlete. In fact, she was at the Olympic level. So she wasn't her very nature, personally driven, and she wanted to win as a team, it was in her DNA. And she had a very coach-like style and she would ... and I know you'll appreciate this. She had a drip, drip approach to giving advice. Particularly to younger people in her team, such as myself. And she would always just infuse it in the conversations and so you never felt like you were being lectured to, or told or coached. It was just a part of constant ongoing learning.

Kim Fletcher:
She's given advice that has stuck with me for my whole career. Three in particular. The first was, lead yourself first. She would say, "You can't always control the outcomes in your life, but you are always part of the influencing processes that decide that outcome." And so if you're leading yourself first, you can control how you react to those outcomes. And people want to be led by people who are leading themselves well. And she modeled that for us. And so I've already kind of picked that up. The second she said is, "Be confident in what you know. And be curious by you don't know." And to this day, I still ask a lot of questions. I read every morning, I invest in my own, in my team's professional development so that we can infuse those new learnings into all we do.

Kim Fletcher:
The third thing she said, which was very practical, was, "High performers hire other high performers." Well, I got to say it being 24, at first, I was just thrilled she thought I was a high performer and got some positive feedback. And then I kind of really dug down and heard the additional responsibilities she was saying to me, because I was, at that time, hiring a co-op student. That I needed to really hire people that maybe I would work for one day. And if I kept that always top of mind, then I would want people to join the organization. And my team specifically, that could be mentored, who could grow and flourish. And maybe one day I could work for them and I'd be proud to do that. Those three pieces of advice have been ones that you look back at, what is a good boss? It's someone who's peppered you with all of these pearls of wisdom that you can take forward yourself. And it's helped shaped my career in many of my conversations with my staff.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and the thing is too, is that the leaders who pepper the wisdom in, the only reason it sticks is because you saw them live it. We've had lots of leaders pepper wisdom at us before, but I think the reason that I'm hearing that this made an impact on you is because she also lived these principles and then you could see them in action.

Kim Fletcher:
Oh, absolutely. And then one exercise she had us do. I don't know, you've probably read the book, Stephen Covey's, Good to Great, it's pretty much a classic. At that time we had to read it, we had to do that exercise of writing a eulogy. And I don't know if you've ever did that, but at 24, that was really not top of my mind. But it really caused me to think like, "What did I want the people who mattered most to me to think about me after I was gone?" And that's where we got into the conversation of purpose. Like what was my purpose in life? What did I want my life to represent?

Kim Fletcher:
You pick up quotes in your life. And the one that kind of came through me through this process was, "To the world, you maybe one person. But to one person, you can be the world." And that really became my mantra to this day. In fact, at one point my kids had it inscribed on the back of a new iPhone when you could do that a few years ago as a Christmas present. Just to remind me that I need to always be mindful. You can do big things with many people, but really you often can just do amazing things with one person if you focus and you don't pass them by.

Christine Laperriere:
That is a fantastic one. And it's so interesting when you mentioned that, I actually remember doing my eulogy. I took a Franklin Covey course, one of my first courses in my first internship. And it was exactly that, they started with it and it never has left my mind. I've thought about that, I mean, I must have been 21 years old and I remember that so distinctly.

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah, it's a great exercise. And one that anyone can do today because it really forces you down to like, what is your key leadership essence? And what are you as a person within the context of the current humanity?

Christine Laperriere:
What's going to be your impact in the world? What is the thing you're going to leave when you're not here anymore?

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah, that's awesome. And the other thing that I took away when you asked me about best boss was really, Proctor and Gamble, I worked for them for a few years. And there was a lot of great bosses, but we talk about best boss. Sometimes that can be institutionalized. Proctor and Gamble had a training program and one of the things that they taught their leaders was to focus in on key learnings. And it's funny, my husband was a vendor of Proctor and Gamble and as I was getting ready for this, he said the same thing. He said, "I remember Proctor and Gamble having key learnings." And if you made a mistake, you can't change the past again, it's kind of theme in my best bosses. But you can look forward and what could you do better and differently in the future?

Kim Fletcher:
So one of the characteristics of a best boss that my husband and I both saw, particularly in Proctor and Gamble, as an example. Is the people who don't dwell on the past mistakes, who just dust it off and say, "Okay, what are you going to do going for forward?" But key learnings can also be to like, "What worked really well?" Because sometimes you don't quite know, it's magical, the price, the customer, the environment. Well, it's how can you replicate that again to have scalable and repeatable success? So the other thing I would just add was this whole key learning. And it was just interesting to go from my best boss to a best boss practice. And how those two can be inter-fused.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that. I particularly like that because sometimes in coaching, when you do slow down and ask what worked there or what didn't work? A lot of people feel like it's luck. They point to the context of the situation, they don't point to what's repeatable.

Kim Fletcher:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Christine Laperriere:
And so I'm always hunting for what's repeatable. What can you take from that situation that is repeatable in a future situation? So key learnings, that's a good education for me today. That's my key learning.

Kim Fletcher:
If you learn one new thing a day, I always think it's just been a great day.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. That's why I love doing the show. So this is so good. Tell me a little bit about, what's the impact of working for a best boss? So I always find people struggle with, what is the return on investment sometimes in a great leader? And I'm really trying to see if I can unpack that in this conversation. So could you help me understand, what is the impact in your mind? Whether it's to the metrics, into the business or to the people. What's the impact of working for a best boss ever?

Kim Fletcher:
One of the things my best boss taught me was that when you look out across the Canadian corporate landscape or whatever sector that you're working in. And you can see the people that you have invested in and they, themselves are now contributing. That is really a measure of success. It may not be something that wins you award. But it's something that when you go home at night, that you can say, "I had a small part in that person's career to better them, to help them be successful."

Kim Fletcher:
So one of the things we're doing with best bosses is that they are replicating themselves in the marketplace. And so we have future leaders. The other thing I find with the best boss is they build high performing teams. People want to work for them. So you increase retention, you have higher morale. So people work better, smarter. And they also will work in a more unified way. And that generally develops higher metrics and results at the end because you're all pulling information. You want to win as a team, you want to cross the finish line as a team. If you train and you run, quite often running coaches will have you run and the fastest person who crosses the line, they make them loop back to the slowest person as the line. And you keep looping back. A, because they get more exercise. But it also means at the end, all of the runners cross the finish line together. And that's what I think a best boss does. Is we do have individual successes, but ultimately the team and the organization finishes together. And that's what we really celebrate.

Christine Laperriere:
What a cool concept. I love it. That's great. So with that, tell me a little bit ... I'm thinking about what counter leadership experiences have you had? So maybe not necessarily a worst boss, but what are some of the things that you've seen that you know don't work as well as what you saw your best boss do?

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah. I think one of the least favorite traits of mine and probably of many people's is when a leader's talk and walk don't align. They say one thing, that their own actions don't reflect what they say. And that can come in the form of micromanagement, feeling a lack of trust, feeling that you're out there, but you're maybe not supported. And I think that's where you can see people feel just not sure they're going to give their best. And I don't think it's intentional. It's just that there's not sort of that openness to give it your all. Because there may or may not be the safety net, there may not be the joy or the laughter in that.

Kim Fletcher:
It's funny. I had a boss who I knew of, and he brought me onto his team. And he knew of me, but we hadn't really met in a personal way. And we were sitting down over our initial meetings and he said, "Yeah, I really like to empower my staff." And part of my like light went on and go, "Oh, is this where you just tell me I'm empowered, but I'm not really empowered? Are you really empowering me?" And he was awesome. He knew I liked a challenge.

Kim Fletcher:
And so he flipped over at napkin, we were at lunch. And he wrote two numbers on the back. And he slid it across the table and he said, "Listen, go do those two things." He said, "I am here to support you and ask any questions you want of me. If I don't hear from you, I assume that you're doing great things." He said, "Get those two numbers done. That's what the business needs to have happened. And there'd be great rewards. Don't get those two." He says, "Just slip me back your resignation." And I kind of went, "Oh wow. That's like real empowerment." He kind of laughed and he sort of said, "You kind of get what I mean." He wasn't quite so serious on the resignation.

Kim Fletcher:
But it was really just, I trust you to go do what your level and your experiences and your capabilities, just go get this done. And I have to tell you, it was so much fun. I did go to him for advice. I did go to him to help me out in certain situations to remove barriers. But I really embraced what he told me and that was, "I want you to be empowered." And that as an individual and a leader, I look back and say, "Boy, you really walked your talk. You didn't have to do that, but you wanted to do that and you trusted me to do it." And that was pretty exciting.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and when I hear that, I hear true intrapreneurship. Which we talk about, we have all these people that are leaving the corporate world and going out and starting their own small practices. And it's because they want the autonomy. They have a sense of "entrepreneurship" but I'm hearing a lot of people don't know how to foster intrapreneurship, which is having a lot of autonomy inside of an organization. So I just heard that and went to me, that's intrapreneurship.

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah, very much. I think that there's a balance between having guardrails and then feeling someone's being sort of trapped. Guardrails are helpful to say, "Let's get together every quarter and review your metrics and see how you're doing. And then let me know if I can support you along the way." That can feel like a challenging situation, or it can feel like a show and tell.

Kim Fletcher:
And when you get to those meetings, it's really about, "Am I asking for help? And do I get help?" And that really is that what you're talking about, is feeling that sense of intrapreneurship. Is that in between those quarterly meetings, I'm empowered to make choices, I'm empowered to get help, or I'm empowered to flourish in my own uniqueness, bring my skillsets to bear. And then on the quarter, I get together just to make sure that I'm aligned or if I need more support, that it's already there for me. And I think as more organizations move to that type of agility, we'll start to see more people thrive in that entrepreneurship.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. And then, I mean, just circling back to what you mentioned as well about the not best boss, that lack of ability to walk your talk. And it just made me think back to your best bosses, lead yourself first. So if you have those mantras and you have those leadership principles that you want everyone else to behave and abide by, you lead that first. You demonstrate those capabilities first and then you let everybody see how it's done versus just talking it.

Kim Fletcher:
Yeah. And if you lead with purpose, then people know where you're going. It's very clear, your values, in that decisions that you make and how you engage with people. Because it's true to who you are as a person.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. And so, I guess, if you had to teach or advise some future leaders, I know I've got a lot that listen to this show. They're out there and they're working hard. They're coming out of the pandemic, so we've been working home for a year and a half and people are trying to figure out how to manage remote teams. They're trying to figure out how to manage people who might even be thinking about leaving the organization because we do have so much turnover happening right now. What would be your words of wisdom for those folks who are listening right now?

Kim Fletcher:
If I go back to one of the pieces of advice earlier, I would lean on this. Be confident in what you know, and be curious by what you don't know. You know, as leaders, that you are really strong in certain areas. You've had great experiences and great capabilities. And where you don't know something, be authentic in saying, "I don't know much about virtual working from home. I don't know how to manage someone's individual stress with young children or aging parents. But I'm here to ask some questions, how can I help you? How can I get you help?" And then as you ask those questions, you will learn and it'll move to the category of, be confident in what you know. And if you keep with that piece of advice, I find you can weather just about any business or personal up or down.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. Thank you, Kim. Do you have anything else you want to share just before we wrap?

Kim Fletcher:
I would just like to thank you, Christine. I mean, I've learned from you as well, and it's great to see something that I learned decades ago and you working with myself and my teams in terms of drip, drip. And I think it's important that when we are leading others, we can do these intensive, let's get together and learn something sessions. But it's really, as we walk along those paths together that we learn the most. And so I would just continue for myself and for you and for your listeners to really be teaching and learning all along with your staff. Because that's really where you build those relationships and that's where I think people feel they can bring their whole self to work because you get to know who they are.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Thank you so much, Kim. Thanks for coming on the show.

Title: Christine speaks about being a parentpreneur
Host: Jenelu Payne
Guest: Christine Laperriere

Jenelu Payne:
Hey everyone. Welcome back to the Generational Wealth Summit. And today we have Miss Christine Laperriere and she is the president of Leader In Motion, an organization focused on developing high-potential leadership talent with special expertise supporting women in leadership. She authored a number one Amazon best seller title called Too Busy to Be Happy: A Guide to Using Emotional Real Estate to Grow Your Work-Life-Wisdom. Parentrepreneurs, please welcome the one and only Christine Laperriere.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. That was an awesome intro.

Jenelu Payne:
I really love the topic for today and the topic is the best wealth practices for parents, business and family. And I know that you are the perfect person for this topic, and I am just so excited to have you with us.

Christine Laperriere:
Looking forward to it.

Jenelu Payne:
So many entrepreneurs feel like if they ever stop to take a break, they will lose money. Where do you think this belief comes from?

Christine Laperriere:
There are so many layers to why I think this happens, but the first one that I think, I call it two-dimensional thinking about time. So we think of time equaling money, and we're kind of taught that from an early age, because we take hourly jobs where time equals money. In all fairness, many of us, as entrepreneurs, immediately think to ourselves, "Well, if we want to make double or triple what we just made in our hourly job, we're going to have to work double or triple the hours." And we sign up for it because we get into businesses we're passionate about, and we love that opportunity to create. So it's a little bit of wiring and DNA mixed with a little bit of what I'll call failed logic on the physics of how we create money.

Jenelu Payne:
Now, what is the tangible result of this way of thinking?

Christine Laperriere:
Obviously, there can be some great results, because we know some entrepreneurs who have created just amazing things and changed the world. And so there's obviously some good to it. But on the flip side, I think, as a apparent entrepreneur, and even prior to that burnout, is the thing that so many of us face. It's interesting when I think about it, my brother is a musician and was always scared to become an entrepreneur musician, for fear of falling out of love with something that he was so in love with.

Jenelu Payne:
Wow.

Christine Laperriere:
So I think about it and I go, burnout's definitely the number one challenge, but the fear of falling out of love was something that drove us to want to be entrepreneurs in the first place. I think that's scary.

Jenelu Payne:
You're right. It's definitely scary. It really is. And you know what? A lot of times, us, as parents, we seem to get burned out so easily because we've got a lot of things coming at us at one time. We have a business and that's our baby, as well as our babies. But all of this really burns us out. Why should we take time away from our businesses?

Christine Laperriere:
I'm going to start by rephrasing that question. I love this question, but as soon as you say to an entrepreneur, "Should we take time away?" You got to think of us. We're a little bit like addicts with using our time to create a business. What I actually am a advocate of, and I talk about this in Too Busy To Be Happy, is this concept of understanding what your emotional real estate is. So it's the energy, the fixed amount of budgeted energy, that we all have to manage everything that's coming bad us in life. So, things with kids, things with unknowns, things with spouses, conflict, change, just trying to build healthy habits, uses a lot of emotional real estate. Dealing with my three and a half year old son who has decided he's boycotting sleep this week, that uses up a lot of emotional real estate and then trying to manage a business and even fear of the unknown uses a lot of emotional real estate.

Christine Laperriere:
So what I really would say is I pay attention to activities that give back more emotional real estate than they take. And so what I would advocate for is instead of thinking of it as taking time away from the business, I would talk about it as investing time in doing activities that give back more energy than they take. Just like I was saying to you as we start started the show, 20 minutes on the treadmill today, just to give myself a chance to catch my breath and get a little bit of movement. That activity gave more energy back than it took. And that's where I feel like it's not about taking time away from my business, it's actually about investing in activities that give me energy back, that allow me to use that as a budget against my business.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that approach. Now, when you work from home though, as most of us do, some of us, parents, it can get hard. Now, do you have any tips for that?

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I will say working from home, it's a very unique challenge. When I started my business in 2008, a couple of things that I did that really helped, so I had a dedicated office space, everything work related stayed in that space, even though it wasn't a [inaudible 00:05:32] room, it was kind of my little den, leveraged the power of habit, because now we're using our unconscious mind to get things done. So, habit is powerful. So I used to wake up every day and make my coffee, walk my dog, all that good stuff, and by nine o'clock, I was always in my office and I was always seated at my desk, getting ready to work. And what I found is then, at the end of the day, I would then get up, move away and go somewhere else in the house.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, I am a big advocate for don't work in your living room, even if it is just a desk, and that desk is your anchor for where you work. Just being very mindful because the brain is a funny thing. So, if you sit down with the same exact desk every day with the intention of work, your brain was start to do that and perpetuate that for you. And so anything you can do to build some habit. I found noise-canceling headphones to be absolute savior, still going back and using the same office space and really teaching the kids to stay away from that desk, kind of teaching them what that meant, helping your family start to recognize what those routines look like and what those rituals look like. So that it makes them easier for them to know what the ground rules are.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that you said that you have to create habits because this is so important for us, as parents, entrepreneurs, any of us. It's so important for us. And I remember the saying "Repetition is the mother of skills". So if you continue to just do this routine while you're at home, then eventually things will become natural. Christine, with your expertise, what would be the number one best wealth practice advice you would give to parents who are entrepreneurs and why?

Christine Laperriere:
It's an interesting one. The first that I think of is to always have six months to a year of salary in your bank account, as soon as you can achieve it. Again, I understand the difference between a startup and a long term business, they are two different things. So if you just started your business yesterday, don't be disappointed, it's coming. But to think very consciously, when I began my business, I thought very strategically about paying myself a salary. Fortunately, I was around a lot of other entrepreneurs and I got a chance to learn some of these tips from them, but I paid myself a salary that was a little bit under what I was actually making and just kind of learnt to live on that salary, again, once I got my business off the ground. And what I found is that six months to a year of savings does this incredible thing where you make more clear and conscious decisions around your business, you fire the bad customers.

Christine Laperriere:
It's almost like if you think of driving a car, it's like, if you're constantly terrified that you're going to run out of gas, like you're swerving to the left, you're swerving to the right, you're driving like a maniac, but if you know you have a little something in the tank, there's no need to overreact. I started my business in 2008, so I think it was very good advice. But once I had a little bit of cash in the bank and I didn't ever treat that as spending money, that is my salary, that's kind of my extra run rate for my salary. So if I have a bad month or a customer doesn't pay or something happens, I'm going to be fine next week, it's going to be fine. So it allows me to handle those decisions without overreacting or even being emotional in those situations, because I know the sky's not going to fall.

Christine Laperriere:
And then perfect example of this was recreated because when the pandemic hit, I have a business where I'm on site a lot with large companies, and first thing that happens when crisis hits is large companies cut budget for all leadership development and investment in their people, unfortunately that a lot of them do. And second thing that happens is when all your work is on site, all of it gets canceled, so there's nothing for me to build. So it was a classic example of this. I had a year's worth of cash in the bank as part of my business strategy. I've done that for 13 years. I kind of just looked at my husband, I'm looking at my kids and I'm like, "Well, we're good for a year. We got a year to figure this out." And he's looking at me going, "Well, most pandemics last 18 months." and I'm going [inaudible 00:09:43]. But that said, I mean, it was just nice to not have that on top of everything else. And it would've been so easy to live the lifestyle that would've used up that whole budget. But the point is protect that. I'm always thinking about that, how many months of advance am I good for, when I do my budgeting and my financing.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that. That is the best advice.

Christine Laperriere:
Think about the benefits of decision making when you're not on under stress, when you're not scared about feeding your kids next week. You make better decisions. As a parent, when you think you're not going to be able to feed your kids, you act crazy, which is normal in nature, mother nature lets us do that. But it makes being a parent, you're going to be quick to throw in the towel, you're going to be quick to go for somebody, you're going to be quick to make stupid decisions, you know?

Jenelu Payne:
You're right. I can really agree to that because like you said, when you are at that level of stress, you really don't think properly. And also it's not giving you time to be free to create for your children, for your legacy. It's just really hard on top of that. So it's really and truly the best advice that you can give someone is to make sure that, "Hey, you are really secure." And that way you can have that peace of mind because us, as parents, we long for a peace of mind. What are some systems or strategies that we can put in place that will help entrepreneurs have a better work life and family life balance?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. I mean the one thing that I'm really thoughtful of and I really point the phrase "Work-life-wisdom". So I always say work life balance is the wrong long term because nothing is 50-50 and my days never look 50-50 to be honest. But what I do know, and I would encourage every parent to get really clear on, is what their work life wisdom looks like. So what is it that you specifically need, in your situation, given who you are and what makes you happy? What do you need to make it all work? So, for example, for me, I have two very young children and I'm in that particular phase right now. So they're not teenagers, they're not eating at friends' houses or anything. And I want to have dinner with my family every night. So, before the pandemic, my rule was I only wanted one night in which I would not eat with my family.

Christine Laperriere:
And that meant if I was going out of town for a speaking engagement or to teach, I wanted to take the last flight out that night and I would try to make sure that I was back within 24 to 48 hours. But I would try to have dinner with my kids four out of five nights a week. And that was just what my work life wisdom was. So if I was planning any kind of travel, like if I was planning to be somewhere, I'd even plan to be in the conference, I'd ask them to put me up in the afternoon versus the morning, because my work life wisdom tells me, as soon as I miss two meals with my kids in a week, I feel like a disconnected mom. I can live without feeding them breakfast or I can miss more breakfast, but something about that dinner time is really important to me.

Christine Laperriere:
For me, that's my work-life-wisdom. I might go back to work after the kids go to bed. But I also am really conscious of... I like to have a couple hours a week where George and I watch Netflix together at nine o'clock at night with no kids around. And for us, that's our time to just hang out as friends and just be partners and not have the pressure of our children around. And so I kind of have a couple of these things that are very important, sacred work life wisdom activities, and it might not look 50-50. So if I took the hours I dedicate to my business to the hours of these practices, they're not 50-50. There's probably 20 hours of real life happening here and there's easily 50 hours of business. But they're so important to me because when I look at myself in the mirror, that's how I get to feel like I'm a committed mom, committed partner, and that I'm living my best life and I'm living the life that I'm here for. I'm not chained to my business at the expense of everything.

Jenelu Payne:
Oh, yeah. That is so good. Everything that you said, it really resonate with me as well, as a parent and an entrepreneur. I also feel that it if you have that balance, you won't get so burned out. What do you do when you can't handle the life you've created and wish you had more time?

Christine Laperriere:
As you get further into being an entrepreneur, starting to ask 'who?', not 'how?', becomes a really important question. So I have easily six or seven different people who have very specific expertise that I pay to do their magic. And to me, that's what being an entrepreneur should be. It's like we get paid to do our magic. It's not a time thing, we're getting paid to do the thing that we are particularly talented in, but that's exactly it. So having people paid to do the things that use up a lot of emotional real estate, for me, is huge. Use the money that you do make to help balance out that energy. Don't be afraid to... Again, ask 'who', not 'how', especially as you get a little further in and you've got a little bit more financial resources.

Jenelu Payne:
Oh, yeah, definitely. I love that you said the 'who', not the 'how', because I think a lot of us as entrepreneurs, we always want to do everything for ourselves at first. Now, you are an Amazon bestselling author, with the book called Too Busy to Be Happy. Now, tell us more about this book and why should we get it?

Christine Laperriere:
Sure. I mean, one thing that I talk about in the book, you'll definitely hear me talk about being an entrepreneur and stress management. So I think that might be one of the biggest reasons right there, but the thing is it's a bit of a cautionary tale of burnout and what that looks like, because high performing, hard workers, we are at risk for burnout. And my own experience is just a perfect example of that. In 2007, I went through kind of a breakup and too many promotions and all of a sudden I'm managing teams in two different countries and I'm flying I'm back and forth and all this kind of thing, and didn't know how to shut things off and eventually found myself in a doctor's office. And after numerous tests, the doctor says, "Well, you just got to learn to manage your stress better. Oh, and or here's a prescription for Ativan."

Christine Laperriere:
And then it kind of got worse. And I really woke up one day staring at the ceiling, wondering if it would be good if I could just get sick so that I could have permission to leave my work. And so I tell that story because it's something that so easily happens. And it's interesting, the first time I told that story was 2012, I got asked to teach a class called Mastering Me for women of influence, I was so vulnerable telling this story. I was shaking. This is such an embarrassing thing to admit, right? But I had people come up to me at the end of that class and say, "I'm there. And I'm there right now. And I really understand that story." And then I started telling it more and more.

Christine Laperriere:
So I got asked to do more speaking gigs and even a very large room, I almost always have 10 to 12 people that walk up to me, not just to say, "Thanks for speaking," but who say, "That has happened to me. That exact thing has happened to me. And I thought I was the only person that had ever happened to." And so my argument number one is this, just learn to manage your stress better, nobody understands what that actually is. And so I started to put... I went on a mission to really understand, how do high performing really hardcore people learn how to [inaudible 00:17:44] manage our stress better. And I really did get some very useful tools in there about ways to break things down and categorize them. So you can really understand what's happening. And it's not just your usual stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
I hate to say this, I love Oprah, I'm a giant Oprah fan, but when I get an Oprah blog and it's like, "Meditate more. Go to yoga." You know what? I put meditate on my calendar and now I'm missing my meditation and I'm even more stressed. It's just one more failure, one more thing that I'm missing that day that I should have gotten done. And so I have found that I had to come up with a completely different way of thinking of stress management and how I get out in front of it, because just saying, "Take time to meditate," or "Take time to yoga," or "Take time do this," that wasn't enough for me, it didn't work enough. So I needed a larger, broader system to work. And that's really what I work on in the book.

Jenelu Payne:
I love this. And it is so good that we have someone like you, Christine, to make us aware of this and be okay with talking about it. Now, this is a question that I ask anyone that I interview. Now, what does building a wealthy legacy means to you?

Christine Laperriere:
I thought about that question and something snapped in me a little bit because I was kind of going down the path of money and wealth and here's one of the things struggle with a little bit, it's that I've read over and over again that generational wealth is often lost by the next generation, so one of the things that I'm actually more passionate about than creating generational wealth, I know you asked of wealth legacy, and this is kind of how I think about it, is I really want my kids and to be honest, one of my passion projects to do this for more kids than just my own, but I want to teach kids how to fish. Like, I want to teach them the mindset that actually builds wealth for them personally. And I think this is so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
Like, in a previous life, I was with somebody who had a daughter and I was trying to teach her why walking dogs in exchange for money was a really good thing. And she's like, "Well, I would walk the dogs for free. Because I love the dogs." And I'm like, "That's exactly the type of activity we want you to get paid for." Because that to me is a wealthy legacy, getting paid for the thing that you like doing, to begin with. And also teaching her how she can truly have whatever she wants, if she's willing to be creative about how she earns wealth, to make those things happen. So I really had a bit of a rich dad, poor dad, experience in my own life where my dad came out of Corporate America and he worked that salary job for 30 years and did all the right things. And that did create a very nice lifestyle. But then as I went into management consulting, I was around a lot of self-made millionaires. And so I watched their mindset and the way they raised their kids and they taught their kids how to start businesses, and they taught their kids how to get paid for things that they had passion for. And they taught their kids how to build scale. And I'm like, "To me, that's going to be my legacy."

Jenelu Payne:
Absolutely. Oh, my goodness. You know what, Christine? You're so on point, because this is the subject that I really love to talk about, as far as leaving a wealthy legacy. And to me, like you said, teaching children how to fish, teaching different strategies on how to build a business, things of that nature. I am so passionate about it because, hey, our children are our future. And if we teach this to them right now, then they'll be able to teach their kids so on and so forth. That's the biggest meaning of building a wealthy legacy.

Christine Laperriere:
I'll not be teaching them how to find somebody to work for and just hold on tight and never lose that job for 30 years. It won't be that lesson. It'll be, sure go work for somebody if you want to work for somebody, but you stay empowered, you do it because it feels good and it's the right use of your time. And if you go work for a terrible boss, pack up your stuff and go be so valuable that you can work anywhere else.

Jenelu Payne:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
That's the kind of lesson. I want you to be empowered. You're not going to be at the mercy of everything because honestly, I mean, who knows how much wealth I'll leave to my children. But if they know how to fish, they'll be wealthy forever.

Jenelu Payne:
Be wealthy forever and that's the key. Oh, my goodness. Christine, it was such a pleasure.

Christine Laperriere:
Love the topic. You know what? I love it. I think that I like the concept of parents, I like that it's inclusive of both men and women because lots of men are in the same boat as a lot of us women. And I think it's very cool, what you're doing.

Jenelu Payne:
Thank you so much. It was such an honor to interview you.Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast
Episode: 3
Title: Empowering to be you
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Kim Carlin

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
All right. Kim, thank you so much for being on the show. This is such a pleasure. And just before we get started, I'm going to just mention why I invited you to come onto the show. And it's really because I had the luxury of working with you years and years ago in the same consulting firm. And it was just so neat because people would say to me, as I was new to the organization, "Oh, it looks like you're going to be the next Kim." And so it's such a neat thing because I've just had the chance to work with you and I look up to you so much. It was such a compliment.

Christine Laperriere:
I remember early in my career it being such a compliment for people to say that they could picture me filling the shoes one day of Kim Carlin. So it just made sense to have you on the Best Boss Ever show and hear a bit about your perspective on different bosses that you've worked with in the consulting world, different bosses that you've worked for, just some of your perspectives on leadership given now that you're in a leadership capacity yourself.

Kim Carlin:
Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm excited. So maybe just to start, do you want to give a little bit of context around your career and how you've seen leadership unfold?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah, absolutely. So as you know I've had a lot long career in management consulting. I started my career in a small boutique firm right out of my MBA. So I was pretty new to the world of management at that time. I accelerated through the ranks over the course of the first five, eight years, moved my way up to managing partner in the firm and ultimately was responsible for global business development.

Kim Carlin:
So I reported into one of the founding partners, had a team of people working for me as well as had the luxury of working in over 200 businesses all over the world in virtually every different industry. So that has been a really great experience. And then most recently I transitioned out of my consulting career, moved over to the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, where I've been working there on executive coaching, teaching a leadership development curriculum to executive MBA students. And that's again, been a really fascinating experience working with that cohort of people, future emerging leaders.

Kim Carlin:
And then most recently I've taken a leadership position with CIBC. So I'm going to be supporting them with a transformation effort over the next five years. So that's a little bit of background to me. I have a undergraduate degree in sociology and MBA in strategy and a PhD where I focused exclusively on leadership development and in particular female executive leaders, which is important part of interest for me.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. An Important niche. So then given that, when we talk about that whole idea of best boss ever, I'm curious in your work experience, you probably had the experience of working for, let's say a best boss, but also I know you worked in that small boutique firm for a long time. So what was your perspective on some of the leadership that you observed there and the culture?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah, that's a terrific question. I think growing up in consulting is a little bit of a unique background from a leadership standpoint. So consulting by its very nature is extraordinarily competitive. And I think our firm wasn't different in that regard. We had a culture very heavily male dominated in the early days of the firm. I was the only woman in the firm, a lot of folks that had come from competitive sports environment. So it was this real, highly competitive jock masculine type of culture. I would almost say that the leadership style was punitive in nature.

Kim Carlin:
So there was a bit of a fear, results were everything. You could go from hero to zero really quickly. So I would actually, if I was to be extraordinarily candid, probably suggest that what I learned about leadership from within my organization was the type of leader I didn't want to be. So the fact that I felt that there were gaps in terms of how I was treated, in terms of the way that I was ultimately respected.

Kim Carlin:
And I think that was a big learning for me was to be different in my own leadership style, to be more true to myself, which would've been more interested in engagement, more interested in knowing my staff, more interested in letting them be creative, take risks, et cetera, than the way I was actually managed.

Kim Carlin:
So I think that's an interesting background in terms of my experience with my own personal boss. Certainly over my career in consulting I worked in lots of environments with clients that I would say were great representations of best bosses, people that really took a genuine interest in their staff really had true engagement from their staff.

Kim Carlin:
And even my experience at Rotman over the course of the last three years had a leader there that she was extraordinarily results focused as well, very strong personality type, but valued inclusivity, valued everyone having a voice at the table. Very much was about us being creative, taking risks, creating a culture where risk was rewarded and succeed or fail. It was really about learning. And I felt that that was quite different from, call it my 15 year history in consulting. It was actually quite refreshing. So I think that my own leadership style has really been developed from this unique facet of different kinds of leaders that I've had experience with over the course of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you give me some examples, when you think of that experience with your leader at Rotman, when you talk about risk taking, being rewarded, can you just share a little more detail about what does that look like?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Absolutely. So part of my responsibility there was developing programs and curriculum to support our executive MBA programs. And in fact, the program that I was working in was a brand new program for executives in the health and life science sector. So we were kind of inventing the program. The thinking was, is that most of these folks that were in the program were already pretty advanced in their career so they would already be pretty established leaders.

Kim Carlin:
So one of the things that we found out pretty quickly was that some of the deficiencies, even from these people that on the outside would look to be highly successful, highly accomplished, were the same as any leader that we're dealing with like lots of issues around confidence, lots of issues around personal brand, lots of issues around how to network and how to strategically align yourself within your organization.

Kim Carlin:
So my boss in particular there really encouraged me to develop this kind of unique programming set. It was different from the more traditional management structure, the more framework academic scholarly research. So I used a lot of the work that I had done from consulting, what I learned about effective leadership style, about relationship developing from my consulting background versus the more academic slant to really help build this programming, which was quite unique actually in the Rotman experience, very good outcomes, we had really great feedback from the students.

Kim Carlin:
I think that it was highly successful. And even in my absence I have a number of people reaching out to me to find out more about those programs and how they can continue with the momentum that I generated from that. So I would say that was something that deviated from the straight and narrow of a typical academic environment. And we took a slightly different slant and she was very encouraging of me trying this new type of learning environment, which was very successful.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of a specific example from your consulting days where the leadership felt excluding? I want to talk a little bit about inclusion versus exclusion, how does that actually show up in leadership behavior? So we're busy these days, everything's about diversity and inclusion. And I just find that it shows up in certain leadership quality the feeling of being excluded or included. I want to hear what are your examples that you can think of, the difference for you about feeling included versus excluded?

Kim Carlin:
I think that some of the worst examples of exclusion were the public chastising and the public... The boss that I had was not stop short of publicly chastising you in front of a group, right? So the fear of that, if you are sitting around a boardroom table with a group of people, you hoped you weren't the one that was picked on, but that public chastising was one that certainly was live and well, it was unrelenting.

Kim Carlin:
So there was at times when he wouldn't let things go in terms of these public outcries of times when you perhaps made a mistake. In my own leadership practice now when I'm talking to leaders and talking to my own staff, it's really important for you to actually try something and fail. And if you fail, assuming it's not catastrophic, the most and important experience is what you learn from that.

Kim Carlin:
So what I feel from those public events being chastised is it meant that we were a very risk adverse culture. And it was, if the idea wasn't invented by the founding partners or the most senior members of the team, it wasn't well received. So as a result of that I think we became very myopic in our development. So we didn't have the level of creativity that you'd see in organizations the same level.

Kim Carlin:
So now that I've actually been outside of that environment, when I see the innovation, creativity and how other organizations have moved along the continuum of change and I look back and see how relatively stagnant we were from a methodology performance and outcome standpoint. I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that people were fearful. I guess I can't say other people, but people like me were fearful of truly changing status quo because of this fear of being publicly ridiculed in many ways.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, one of the things I keep noticing when I'm talking to people about the best boss ever is you learn a lot about the conversation ends up becoming a scale of what are the worst things that, not worst boss ever but maybe the worst practices ever versus the best boss ever practices. And so you end up learning a lot about the polarizing of those too.

Christine Laperriere:
So again, if you're fearful about putting innovative creative solutions on the table and we hear that as part of the cultural norm, the opposite of that again is going to be, here you are in an environment where somebody is really challenging and inviting that to the table and they're saying, "I want those creative, I ideas. I want you to take a risk. I want you to fail. I'm going to applaud your failures when you do." And for you, you're really seeing the difference between those two.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. 100%. And as you know Christine, consulting is a competitive environment. It's often an eat what you kill type environment. So rather than working in a collaborative fashion, what was encouraged in our environment was to be very highly competitive with each other. So as a result of that, we didn't have the cohesion of teamwork.

Kim Carlin:
So the public ridicule, the highly competitive environment, the real cutthroat environment, what that did to us was, make us not working I believe as strongly as a synergistic team, as we could have, which I believe now again, with hindsight being 2020, just the has better business outcomes, better superior record and better engagement.

Kim Carlin:
I stayed in this environment. Many people do stay in this environment, but I think we start to become more like those leaders and less like our true selves, which is problematic. And probably if I really dig deep, but I wasn't the kind of person I wanted to be when I was there. And I'm glad that I've had the ability to be able to recognize that in myself and pivot a little bit.

Christine Laperriere:
And then I have one last question for you, maybe a very personal question. You're in a same sex marriage or same sex relationship, and I just want to know, you obviously have interacted with so many different people in the business world. And I just know from our conversation offsite about the fact that in certain environments people would know that about you and in other environments you would hold back a little bit about your personal life. What is it about great leaders in general that would make you feel safe to share your full authentic self versus others? I'm just curious. Can you tell us a little bit about that?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Also a great question and one that I reflect on a lot. Obviously over the course of my career, it's been two decades so just society has changed and acceptance around same sex relationships has changed. So there's more openness to it today than there probably was when I started my career. I think that in general the people that... Again, it's the same people that encourage this inclusivity, that all voices at the table are the leaders that you can truly be your authentic self with.

Kim Carlin:
So if you're hiding an aspect of yourself of obviously gender or obviously race or disability, perhaps are more visible than your sexual orientation, but if you're not able to bring your whole self to the table, then you're limited in your ability, I believe to be creative, innovative and to be engaged. Now the interesting dichotomy to some of the things that I said around this highly competitive culture would make you think that that was one at which I would've been somewhat stifled in my sexual orientation, I would actually say it was quite the opposite.

Kim Carlin:
I was always encouraged to be true to who I was within the parameters of our business. But as I mentioned earlier in my career a large portion of my role was in a selling capacity, which meant that I was traveling around the world selling consulting services. And in a sales relationship, whether right or wrong, you are at the mercy of a client's decision on if they like you or not. People buy from individuals they like. And I was very careful and very guarded to be dishonest with who I was.

Kim Carlin:
I often played the gender game, talked about my partner. I actually would say husband versus a partner, certainly wasn't true to myself. But a big part at is really in the recognition that different environments you don't know what their feelings are around sexual orientation. So I think that in places that we went that would be more progressive, that would have policies around that, say financial service firms or maybe large healthcare institutions where there was prescribed policies around being open and diverse, but in many environments I wasn't being true to who I was.

Kim Carlin:
And I think it's a bit of the nature of the type of work that I did. Not saying it's right or wrong. Never was endorsed by the organization I worked for but I was self-imposed. But I'll tell you Christine now, again, being on the other side of this, being in an environment that's very highly supportive of people being completely true to themselves whatever their background is, it's just liberating and feels a lot easier just to go to work and not have to worry and look over my shoulder or play the gender pronoun game, which is just not fair to me or my partner.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, and I know just from having worked for that firm and having two leaders that were in same sex relationships. I always found it very refreshing because I felt the leadership... I just appreciated the diversity of leadership. I appreciated the fact you were the only female in the leadership team. And I guess that helped me feel like there was an opportunity for me in the future, but I also just appreciated the fact that not everybody was cut from the exact same cloth.

Christine Laperriere:
So like you said that was one of the good news part of that culture is that it did seem like they were inclusive on that front. For me, it gave the perception of the fact that you would be accepted regardless. So even if it was competitive and it had its own very specific cultural nature, just seeing some diversity in the actual people who were at the table to me always made me feel a little safer.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. I absolutely think so. And I know you and I are big proponents of having role models that we can look up to in organizations. I think that it's critically important. So I think that was always something that I felt of a strong, important burden on, not a burden in a negative way, but that it was important for me to represent myself appropriately as a female, as someone who is gay and certainly as an executive at the table.

Kim Carlin:
Either at my job now, or in other organizations that I've been part of, I think that it's important for me to represent myself appropriately because I do recognize that people will be looking up to me and looking to be... I don't want to say be like me, but certainly see a positive representation of someone from those types of communities.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And now you have the opportunity now to make other people see that it's possible and that they can be fully who they are without having to, like you said, edit their commentary or hold back a piece of who they are, or if you're at a dinner table with a bunch of clients not having to feel like you have to edit something about your personal life just to fit in, you have the opportunity set that stage where you... Like you said, you experienced your own editing along the way.

Kim Carlin:
That's right?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Kim Carlin:
That's right. There weren't a lot of role models for me 20 years ago. Lots of trailblazers were blazing paths in other industries, in our small firm that wasn't the case. But I'm proud to say that I was and certainly you were part of the trail blazing female group in that organization. And I think we've got a lot to be proud of.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I wonder too just when I reflect upon what you're talking about, when I think of inclusion and how competitive that environment was. I wonder if the intense competitiveness about making sure that you always won the deal was part of what made you insecure about or made you feel like you needed to edit some parts. Because like you said that piece of just you didn't want to risk the deal over you being authentic.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. I think that's absolutely it, right? And like I said no one ever told me to do that. I was never forced to do that but that intent competitiveness, the entire reward and compensation structure was predicated on you selling at all cost. So therefore you did everything, the good sales people did everything they could to put their best foot forward. And I made a judgment call that that's what it required for me. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt that perhaps there was lots of environments I didn't need to do that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Kim Carlin:
But frankly, I felt I did and I had a very successful track record. I don't think it had anything to do with my sexual orientation one way or the other, I hope it had to do with my skill. But it wasn't a risk that at least at that stage I was willing to take-

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Kim Carlin:
Now, yeah, different but that's-

Christine Laperriere:
Well, let's hope that eventually the day comes when putting your best foot forward is that you can completely share all of those things and be, that is your best foot forward. But I completely understand what you're saying because a lot has shifted in 20 years around the perceptions and beliefs around this. Thank you so much for sharing so vulnerably, like I said, I knew I was going to challenge you with some tough questions. So I love-

Kim Carlin:
I wouldn't expect anything you ask Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. I love the fact that you let me go there and ask those questions and I do think people are going to get some great value out of hearing your stories and how your journey has unfolded and how you've learned about what that best boss ever looks like for you now that you move forward.

Kim Carlin:
Thanks. Thanks. Been fun being here. Thanks.

Episode: 4
Title: Let's get you there safely
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Cam Haygarth

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christineaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the show, Cam. I'm so excited that you decided to be a guest for me. You and I have worked together for years now, actually, at different organizations. And one of the of reasons that I thought you would make a fantastic guest is that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you over the years. You are one of the most collaborative, just easy to get along with people that I've ever worked with. And I've always seen that in your leadership. So I really admire you and I couldn't help but be excited to invite you on the show. Welcome.

Cam Haygarth:
Thank you so much, Christine. Happy to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
And just really quick, as we get started, tell people your official title and role today.

Cam Haygarth:
Sure. Today I'm Vice President Marketing and Sales for SureShot Solutions. And if you want to know what SureShot solutions are, that's when you and go order a double-double, where the equipment that accurately dispenses whether it be the cream or the sugar, or the sweetener, or the milk. So that's what we do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Home of the double-double. So few people know that. SureShot's the one that makes that happen.

Christine Laperriere:
So then I'm going to dive right in and I'm going to ask you. I'm so curious, given how I've seen you lead, who comes to mind when I talk of who might be your best boss ever?

Cam Haygarth:
I've been fortunate to say I think I've had three best bosses ever, Christine. And I think I've been around long enough. I've been working for over 30 years now, hard to believe, but you really, really appreciate the good ones because they're, unfortunately, not as common as the rest, if you will. And so I've been fortunate enough to this point in my career have had three fantastic best bosses ever.

Christine Laperriere:
Great. And then, can you share some stories and some insights that you've learned from watching them?

Cam Haygarth:
Sure. The first gentleman, in this case, was early in my career. So I went to business school at Western, graduated, joined Coca-Cola bottler and in Southwestern Ontario in Kitchener. After about a year, I got moved to Sarnia, promoted to Sarnia. The VP for our region, gentleman named Don Mitchell, older gentleman, certainly older at the time. I was early twenties, he was probably in his fifties. Wait a minute. I'm in my fifties now. That's not good. That's not good. He was one of the hiring. He made the final decision on my hire. So I'm potentially a little biased, but just his vision, his communication skills. And with all three of my best bosses ever, just a sincere concern for you as a person, not only as somebody that works on his or her team, but as a person in your development, in your wellbeing.

Cam Haygarth:
And just a little story. An aside, he called me one, I think it was a Thursday evening, and he said, "Cam, I'm supposed to go to the NHL All Star game this weekend in Philadelphia." this is back when we did these type of things, "And I can't go, I have a family commitment. I'd like you to go with my tickets." So got to go to the airport, fly to Philadelphia, go to all these VIP events. Back then, it was a big deal. This was 1993 in Philadelphia. The reason I'm telling you this story, Christine, is, his son had a minor car accident a few weeks before. And I'm in Sarnia. People know Sarnia is down by not far from Detroit Windsor, and I've got to go to Toronto to the airport. And I had a company car, Coca-Cola bottler company car. And he said, "Cam, it's calling for snow tomorrow. I want you to rent a bigger, safer car to drive to the airport in Toronto, just so that you get there for sure. And you get there safe."

Cam Haygarth:
And so that is just one of many examples of just the type of person he was. And in all three cases, Christine, these people, you want to work hard for them, you want to make them proud of you. You want to do whatever you can, whatever it's physically possible to help them win because they care so much about you. And it's sincere. It's not the politician sincere. It's real.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. It's so interesting to hear that, Cam, because that is one of the qualities I see in you. I really feel like you have always demonstrated that from the first time that I met you. When, again, you didn't know anything about me and you just took a genuine interest in, "Who is this person in front of me, can I genuinely get to know them?" And then just your natural attention on the wellbeing of the person first and then doing business second, which to your point has always made me really want to make sure that you're a happy customer when I'm working with you, just because that sincerity comes across, right? Do you think that you got that trait from seeing that behavior and then trying to mirror that?

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah, I believe. I don't know if I got it, but I certainly was able to hone something there by mirroring and kind of watching his style learning. He was the type of guy who could give somebody crap without raising his voice, without swearing, without being disrespectful. Just a couple well-placed comments, words, and the message was clear. And I like to think that I took some things from him, that I've been able to use through the remainder of my career to this point.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. And what about the second boss?

Cam Haygarth:
Second boss was Vince Tim [inaudible 00:06:44]. I worked my way up through the bottling system at Coke, and then had the opportunity to jump over to the company side. So there's the company who have all the money and do the market. And then there's the bottler who does all the delivering, all the heavy work and has all the debt. And I moved to the company side and got promoted to Vice President of Food Service and Hospitality business unit. And my boss was the president Vince Tim [inaudible 00:07:13]. And much of the later years on the bottling side was working for command and control-type leaders. And when times were tough, when things weren't going well, they got louder and yelled more, and demanded more, and pushed more, and threatened more. And I came to work for this gentleman, Vince Tim [inaudible 00:07:39].

Cam Haygarth:
And we were in some tough times, but just seeing how he reacted in tough times and did not lash out, but actually brought people together. And his style, his ability to create a vision, build strategy, execute against it, and his communication skills were incredible. And so I just learned a lot, and that's another consistent theme through all three leaders is, it's not when times are good when you see and you learn, it's when times are tough that you know the good ones really shine through.

Christine Laperriere:
That makes a lot of sense to me. And I mean, I can think of, we're in the middle of a pandemic right now, so there's lots of businesses, organizations all over the place that we're seeing what leaders are made of right now. We're in those tough times for a lot of businesses. So I'm just curious when you're talking about his reaction and tough times, can you just give us maybe even a descriptor or an example of when you specifically remember watching his reaction and being surprised?

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. I think we would get on calls that our executive team would get on a call with our leadership in Atlanta every once a month, generally. And Atlanta at that time, the leadership style was different. It's changed over the years, but it was a little more of that command and control. And so if our numbers weren't where they wanted them to be, there'd be a lot of drilling down, a lot of challenging, a lot of those type of things, and particularly how we're dealing. We were leading the bottler from a franchise or perspective. Those calls could get pretty dark and pretty rough on the members of the executive team here in Canada.

Cam Haygarth:
But Vince could have easily, many times turned to us, to me, as an example of food service, "Why aren't your numbers better?" But he wouldn't... Very often he'd take it himself and he'd push back very often. And very respectfully, again, always respectfully, but he wouldn't just assume things were the way they were and that things had to be that way. He would respectfully push back and challenge back. And just the way he did that, Christine, was new to me at the time. I've since learned that there's a whole world out there with leaders like him, but at the time it was so new to me, so refreshing and so liberating in many ways in terms of the way I thought and the way I led, to be honest.

Christine Laperriere:
So he really had your back, is the impression I'm getting.

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly. And intellectually, you have to perform, you have to drive the results, all those good things, but it wasn't an "Either or", it was, "Okay. When things aren't great, we'll work our way through this and work together on it." So it wasn't just throwing somebody overboard right when things started turning south.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. I think that is one of those things that's, again, kind of easy to say and harder to do as far as the instinct to blame, the instinct to hunt for the fault in another person, that trait shows up again when times are tough and people are under pressure. Someone who can stay calm and collected and, again, rally for their people and rally for the integrity of the work that's getting done. I can see how he would end up on your top-three list.

Cam Haygarth:
For sure.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. Then I'm of course curious to know, I want to hear about the third.

Cam Haygarth:
Well, the third one, you know well, he's my current president, David Macaulay, and you of course introduced me to David and the SureShot Organization several years ago now. And I think aspects of both gentlemen and David, both the first two people I spoke of, the caring understanding side, and this might be part of that Eastern culture down, based in Nova Scotia. But just that, wanting to make sure you're okay, wanting to make sure things are going well in your life, not just work, work, work. And then dealing in tough times, as you mentioned COVID. And our business being in the equipment world, when things slow down, first thing people stop buying is things that they can delay if possible. And equipment very much falls into that category, especially our equipment, which seems to go on forever and ever, which is hard when you're in sales.

Cam Haygarth:
But we hit a real wall back in March and things ground to a halt. And tough times, and fortunately we have a very strong balance sheet, but David is trying to drive results for the shareholders and the stakeholders and, "What do you do?" and, "How do you deal with it?" And he always was calm, cool, collected, was quite open with the organization in terms of communicating where we were, what we were doing and just explaining that things were uncertain, but here's what we are doing. Here's what we can do.

Cam Haygarth:
And always trying to balance the three things, the wellbeing of the business, the wellbeing of our people and the wellbeing of our customers. And trying, not just in the short term, but in the long term. And we did have to do some very difficult things. We had to eventually restructure to a certain degree, but we're now coming out the other end. And I think we're in a great place. And it's because of the leadership communication style and just the ability to relate with our team, with our entire organization on a personal level, very powerful.

Christine Laperriere:
And, just again, it speaks volumes to when you put your people first and you make that investment, like you said, balancing the business between the customers and the people. I think that trifecta right there really does describe... It comes across somehow. I mean, I can even think of my own example of working with David, where I suffered a concussion. And I reached out to him and said, "I can't work for you right now." Obviously I was doing lots of sales strategy work. And I said, "Unfortunately, I have to take...", I think it was 12 weeks off, because I suffered a major concussion while I was working for him. And it was so interesting because the first thing that he said was, "If you need us to pay your invoice, don't worry about it. Just go ahead and bill us." And he was more... Genuinely, his first response was to try to make sure that I had enough money to survive versus his concern.

Christine Laperriere:
In the back of my head, I was thinking, "Oh, they're probably going to end their engagement with me. Three months is going to go by and they're going to hire somebody else." And just that feeling of dread a little bit. But his first concern was making sure that I had some financial stability while I had just suffered this accident. So I will never forget that. When somebody does that, you don't ever forget it. It leaves a mark. That response was so much more powerful than some of the other ones that I received.

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. He just has that. David drives for results and he is detailed-driven, he's focused, but he has that wonderful human touch and that ability to see beyond just the numbers and beyond just the business and understand... People development is such a huge part of our strategy as well. And trying to bring people along, see them progress. And in instances like yours, that's where you just see his big heart, just the way he approaches life in general and people in our organization.

Christine Laperriere:
I always... It's so interesting when you say that because I've really come to this conclusion because I do so much work in the leadership space and I'm always talking about the business case. And everybody struggles with soft skills because they struggle to see you the direct link to the bottom line. So this is part of my passion for this topic right now, is trying to understand really what is the impact of a best boss. And I think of that example with David and all I can say is that when anytime that he needed something, again, if I could figure out how to go the extra mile, I would go the extra mile just because it felt like it would be reciprocated when I needed it.

Cam Haygarth:
That's bang on, Christine. Exactly. All three of these individuals, you want to make them proud, you want to do whatever you can to help them succeed in business, in life. Anything I could do for them business or personal I would do just because of the way they've treated me and treated people in the organization. And you know how much work is part of our life. Those are the type of people like your mother, your father, you want to make them proud and you want to do whatever you can for them. So, definitely.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And then just for compare and contrast, have you ever had a not best boss ever, someone who would not make the list? And maybe you don't have to call them out necessarily by name, but mostly the characteristics or traits that stand out as being the most polarizing for you, or the ones where you just said, "I got to get out of here as fast as I can."

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. Senior level back on the bottler side. Command and control with disrespect, I would say, or with a lack of respect. And the impact that had on people in the organization, on the team. And it would create, just as good, strong values and attributes can transcend and can permeate the entire organization, so can disrespect some of those negative elements, they can, especially when it's coming from a senior level, it can permeate the organization.

Cam Haygarth:
And I saw that and I saw how it damaged good people who had to eventually exit, and then how it turned some people with good potential almost to the dark side in terms of where they gravitated, how they responded and reacted. And, fortunately, again, in my career, I haven't had too much of that, but there's been enough, very, very different, just two different ends of the spectrum, for sure, in my opinion.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I mean, I just love that you're bringing that point up, and I think it's a really great spot to pull it to close, which is, in my impression, what I find is that people mirror each other. That is what culture is. And so culture is always this. Again, it's hard to describe how do you invest in the culture of a business because it's not a tangible thing, does it actually impact the bottom line? It's really hard to prove a lot of the times because it's so subtle, but when you say that, I mean, I think of you explaining your best bosses ever, and how much of that shows up in the way that you lead and you interact with people, and then meanwhile to your exact point.

Christine Laperriere:
And I've seen it too, the disrespectful behavior. It's catchy because people start to say, "Well, that's got to be what I need to do to get noticed around here." And imagine when you start to have an organization that fills up with disrespectful people who are in that control-and-command style of leadership. I mean, you're not having the response that you and I just had where we said, "We'll do triple back flips because we want to make you proud." That goes away. You're like, "I will do the minimum amount to just stay off of your radar."

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Even if you're a top performer, it's hard to bring your A-game to someone who could be disrespectful.

Cam Haygarth:
And they say winning drives culture, but often you can't win right away. And sometimes you have to take when the times are tough or the situation is such that you're going to lose a few games before you start winning. And it's how you treat each other in those tough times that really helps pull you out and take you to a better place in the future.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Cam Haygarth:
And that's what, in my mind, builds that culture.

Christine Laperriere:
And you teach other people exactly how to respond to a tough time by the way you lead.

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Well, thank you, Cam. This was fantastic. And I know for a fact that there are people listening that can resonate with your story, for sure.

Cam Haygarth:
Thanks so much for the opportunity, Christine. Appreciate it.

Episode: 5
Title: Always on my side
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Tonya Campbell

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Hello, Tanya. And thank you so much for joining me on the show. I'm so glad to have you here. Now, I'm just going to start by saying why I invited you into the show. So I am getting this opportunity to work with you on the advancement of women. It's a large initiative, and I just love the insight and wisdom that you have from so many years of working in different parts of the organization and moving your career. And some of the stories that you tell and some of the insights that you have, I just find so fascinating, and so inspiring. So I had to have you on the Best Boss Ever Show. So thank you so much for joining me.

Tonya Campbell:
Oh, thanks for having me, Christine. It's a real pleasure to be here today.

Christine Laperriere:
And just so everybody knows, can you do a quick introduction?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. A quick introduction. So my name is Tanya Campbell. I am a regional vice-president for mobile financial planning team within Scotiabank. And I've been with the bank for, coming on to 25 years. So lots of experiences with bosses, I think in that 25 years, probably over a dozen roles. So that's over a dozen bosses and probably lots to share.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Well, that's why I just want to dive in. So, again, of those dozen bosses you would've seen and learned so much. So when you think back about some of the ones that stand out as your best boss ever, who comes to mind and why?

Tonya Campbell:
So I would say there's a few of them and, without calling out names, the ones that really stand out for me share very, very common characteristics amongst them. And it's easy enough to just say, they trusted me, they gave me autonomy, they gave me some flexibility to do my job the way I needed to do it. I think the real issue is, you have to talk about specifically what those things mean, but I would say that the ones that come top of mind did offer me trust, flexibility, autonomy, and the trust was probably the number one at the very, very top of it all.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you were to describe for so many of us, what does trust look like in motion? When you're working for a boss and you know, that is there. Tell us exactly what does that look like?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to describe, but I would use the words or I would use the analogy they have my back, and you only really know what you have my back means when you experience it. And for me, I think the best way to describe specific example would be there was a time when I was running a project, very high stakes projects, my perspective anyways across the bank. And you always know, especially over time as you develop through your career, you know which ones are high stakes, you know when there's people who are talking or meeting about certain topics behind the scenes.

Tonya Campbell:
And when you have somebody who has your back, you know that when things aren't always going well, because let's face it, not everything goes perfect a hundred percent of the time or, conversely, it could be going perfectly fine, but you will always have stakeholders who view things differently.

Tonya Campbell:
And for me, it was always knowing, or it was knowing that when those differences of opinions or perspectives were happening, that my leader was 100% always on my side. So if things were being said or done that were making them feel like maybe perhaps the stakeholders or the person that's sharing the opinion, if it didn't really seem like it was coming off in my favor, I knew that they would use words like, let me check into that.

Tonya Campbell:
And it was not ever about siding with what was going on or feeding into that. And the reason I knew that was because that boss would come back to me and say, "Hey, what's going on?" And they would give me the opportunity to share my perspective first and then in a very safe way go, "Here's what was said. And let's talk through that."

Tonya Campbell:
And so, it always felt like they gave me the benefit of the doubt first before feeding into any sort of negative dialogue or what have you. And that's just one example, I can think of. I'm drawing on that experience as we talk about without giving away the project. But that very specific example, I knew because there was multiple times where there was things that appearances from other people that it didn't look like it was going so well, but that boss always came to me. And honestly the person I report to right now, I have that exact same feeling. It doesn't matter what the initiative is. I know that that person trusts me and I got to tell you the other part, the other tangible thing that comes from feeling trust is that you feel braver.

Tonya Campbell:
You feel more okay to take risks, you feel more okay to take control, to make decisions because you're not fearing any of the ramifications. And I know there were times when in my current role where perhaps I had to make a judgment call and wasn't exactly sure if it was the right judgment call, but because I felt safe and I felt trust, I made the decision and I knew that the call even if it was a bad call, that the discussion with a leader would have been okay, let's walk through that. Why did you make that decision? And that could have been a learning experience rather than a beat up experience. So that's a couple of experiences I've had.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the way that you point out when you work for a leader that trusts you, you feel braver. So what do you think feeling braver actually does for your development?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. I mean, you take risks and I think risk taking is what makes you grow and it's okay. When you're an environment of trust and that trust breeds risk, then you know that there is outcome that is bad if you take the risk and it's successful. Yay, because winning breeds winning or whatever phrase you want to use. Success breeds success, winning breeds winning. But when you're in a safe environment and you have trust, if you fail, you know that it's going to be seen as something that you're learning from and how you're going to do better next time. And so, it's a win-win outcome, whether it's a win or whether it's a fail.

Tonya Campbell:
And you know that when you're in that environment, I think that you can also know that when you're not in that environment, because if you're feeling constrained, if you're feeling like you can't make up decision, if you're feeling like, "Oh my God, I don't want to do that, because I'm going to get in trouble," then you're going to know in that with a great boss because you're not empowered. So the exact opposite is also true.

Christine Laperriere:
And I just going to bring this up because this is one of my passion topics, but what does it do for your stress level too? When you look at the difference between working for someone who says, "Don't worry about it, I've got your back to take risks," versus when you're working for someone and you don't have that safety or that security.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. It's the difference between thriving and surviving. And honestly, when I think about the rules that I've been in, where I'm thriving, it's because I've got trust in that environment. And surviving has been in situations where like, I need to outlive this person or this group where there is no trust and surviving is, I'm going to do just what I need to do today to get to tomorrow and get to the next day until I'm finding myself somewhere else. So it is literally the difference between thriving and surviving.

Tonya Campbell:
Christine, I have peers and people who come to me for advice all the time on navigating their career, where they should go, what they should do, how have I navigated it. And some of the things that I share with them, obviously like there's networking and relationship currently is a big topic you and I have discussed at length lately.

Tonya Campbell:
But I always say to them, when you are doing that, when you're going through that process, be very careful because people can want to go like, I would love to work in this area, I'd love to work in technology or I would love to work in distribution leadership, or I would love to work in customer experience. And you could, you very well could. But you need to actually go and find out about the leadership and the environment there. And really what I'm getting at is the level of trust is not, you do need to ... Obviously you're almost like, people think about, "Oh, I'm going to go, and I'm going to network with this leader. Because I want them to think about me for the next job."

Tonya Campbell:
I'm like, well, you might want to go there and think about whether you want them to be the leader for you at the next job. It is a two way street. And that reason I tell them is because you can love the work itself, what you're going to do. But if you don't love the boss, the person that you're reporting to and the people around you, which are often a function of the trust in that environment, then it doesn't work. You can let in, just as much as you can love the person and the colleagues and the environment around you. But if you hate the work, that's not going to work.

Tonya Campbell:
You need to find that balance of those two and that it really truly does come from, it starts with the boss, right? Because that is what creates that environment of trust. And so, I think there's some really cliche things about good bosses, which they provide trust. They empower, they give autonomy and all those good things. It's cliche for a reason, it's because it's true. Like when you get those things, you feel like you're in an environment where you can thrive and not survive.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. So one question I have for you while we're just closing this. So now that you're in a leadership position and you have people that are coming to you, when you think of autonomy, for example. So there's a high risk project and you could go ahead and say, "Hey, I'm going to let you run with it. I've got your back." But you know that there's personal consequence to you if they fail or they don't get it right. Or you might have to do it over, or you might have a lot of it could come down to you, people asking you, "Why didn't you manage this person, well?" How do you deal with that now that the roles are reversed.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. So then I guess that becomes the question of, well, how, like how do you become a good boss? How do you provide autonomy and authority? And it really boils down to communication because ultimately if I provide authority to somebody, but I haven't given them proper instruction, that's on me. I should be in trouble. If I'm the throat to choke and it fails, I should. But giving people authority and autonomy to do their job comes with, they have to have the right instruction. They have to know what the goal is. And so that has to come from me. So that is what is required of a good boss, is to start with providing the vision, the instruction, what you can, and can't do. Like you have to give them the guideposts of what they can work within.

Tonya Campbell:
And once they have that, then you let them go. That's how I look at it. And again, when I think back to those people who did that for me, who set the good example for me. They taught me what's my playground, what are the guardrails in which I can play in. And then I knew, okay, it's outside that. Well, I better seek guidance and authority because it's outside of those bounds. And so, yeah, it really boiled down to that, and communicating as often as possible.

Tonya Campbell:
So providing an open door policy so that if they're unsure, they can safely come and ask those questions and not feel like they're going to be admonished for it. So it's seeking to understand. So now that I'm not in the boss's shoes and I have a team under me, having their back is doing exactly what I just shared with you, which is when I hear something, I go, "Thanks very much for that information." And then I go to my direct report and I go, "Hey, what's going on?" Seek to understand first. We all know there's three sides to every story, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Tonya Campbell:
It's really listening before you speak, it's listening and asking a lot of questions to get a good, deep understanding, listening to hear the answer, and not listening so you can respond. So I try to do and model all those things because they were the things that were done for me and worked for me and allowed me to thrive in my career.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. And then I have to ask the question. We all know that we learn the most, sometimes from the worst boss we've ever had. And you don't have to name any names, but just when you think of those lessons, what did you learn from the people who weren't the best leaders or your favorite leaders?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, Christine, we did have a little bit of a preamble on this topic, and I think back to that, and the truth is, you can't have the good without the bad. How do you know what's good unless you also know what's bad and the bad also for those of you, those people who want to be good can take what happened in that situation and make themselves better, which makes you more good. So those experiences for me, when I think about those times, and obviously not naming any names, they were really, really hard experiences to have. And I've shared with you that analogy of the thriving versus surviving. So yeah, I did have a couple of times in my journey over the 25 years where I was surviving and not thriving.

Tonya Campbell:
And it was hard in that moment to think about it and, "Oh, what can I take away from this?" So no judgment, if you're in that moment or in that right now, and you can't take the good out of it, but I assure you when you get out on the other side, if you look back and you go, "What was it that was so painful?" For me, it was taking it and looking at it and saying, "I made make a commitment. I will never do that. I will never be that kind of a person, because I'm going to etch this in my memory, how awful that made me feel. And therefore I will not do that to somebody else."

Tonya Campbell:
And again, you talk about cliches, but the behaviors in those scenarios were almost the exact opposite of all of the things I just shared with you, which was, I didn't feel like I had trust. I felt like I didn't have autonomy. I had somebody who was over me constantly. Where's this? Where's that? Second request, third request, when maybe they didn't give you the instruction, which is what I just shared with you, which is key, right? I'm like, well, I didn't give it to you because you didn't tell me you needed it, right?

Tonya Campbell:
And so, it's lack of access, lack of clarity and the instruction it's blame. Blame is a big thing for me in that environment where there's a bad boss, I've got air quotes, this is an audio. But if you could see me I'm air quoting, the bad boss. There's often an environment of blame. And so you're constantly feeling like you've got this shield over protecting you from the blame, the finger being pointed at you.

Tonya Campbell:
So that's the opposite. But yeah, the beauty, if you can look at it afterwards is you can take that experience. If you're committed to being a good boss, you want to be a good boss in the future. You take that experience and you commit to not doing those things. And if you have no aspiration to be a good boss, because maybe you can go, let's be honest, not everybody aspires to leadership, but what you can learn from it is, what I went back to take us back to where we were earlier, which is knowing what to look out for when you are looking at changing positions in the future. Or it's, how do you sniff that out? How do you know when you're reverse interviewing for a boss? How do you know that that's the type they are? And my advice to people would be to ask about leadership style and more importantly, interview the people on the team, ask them how things are, right?

Christine Laperriere:
I'm smiling while you're telling this story. Because one of my famous moments in my career, I went to work for someone and prior to taking the job, I interviewed three different people that had worked for him. And every single one said, "Don't go work for him." And I said, "I get along with everyone." And then I proceeded to march off and go work for him and learned 18 months later that I don't get along with everyone. And I guess to your exact point, you go do your homework, but also to not be so naive that you do get ... Some of us walk in thinking, "Oh, but I'll be able to handle that. Well, I'll be able to handle that." But when you talk to three or four people and they all, don't feel like that person is the most empowering, just be prepared.

Tonya Campbell:
Yes. One red flag means talk to another person, two red flags. It's probably two red flags, and three is, definitely don't go there. But I would say, when do people not see the red flags? It's when they're desperate to get out of their situation that they're in right now. So that's if you're desperate because you're in the survival mode, you are more apt to make a mistake. And I would say that is when you need to be the most cautious and do the most due diligence. And on the flip side, I forgot all these juxtapositions, all these oppositions to each other.

Tonya Campbell:
The truth I think is also when you're in the thriving mode that I discuss or have shared with you. I think it's easier to find the thriving again, because it's like a snowball effect. Once you're in there, you just never really gravitate back towards them. So I think the truth could also be said about the bad boss situation, but I've seen people who've been able to navigate their way out and navigate their way back in by mistake out of desperation.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Any last tips for any leaders that are listening right now and they want to take something away, really tangible that they should implement next week?

Tonya Campbell:
No, I think that, for me, it's understanding your own style of leadership, and I think I've done some homework on leadership, I've read books and stuff. And if I were to describe my style and the styles that have really worked for me and for many people around me is, it's a servant style leadership. And I think if you're a leader, who's trying to figure that out and understand what they want to be. If you want to be the one that provides trust, who provides lots of instruction and gives people autonomy. If that sounds like the type of boss you want to be, then you have to understand what servant and style leadership is.

Tonya Campbell:
And that is that you work for those people, not that they work for you. And if you adopt that mindset, like I'm here to serve you. I'm here to make your job easier. I'm here to empower you. It means you're serving them. And so that's my view. It's not necessarily everybody's view and certainly other leadership styles work, but it's been my experience that when you look at it from that perspective, you see your employees differently, you see them as wanting to ... You truly, you genuinely want to understand. It's like I'm not doing this because the book said I should do it. I'm doing it because I serve these people.

Tonya Campbell:
And it really does for me, like when I understood that about myself, that that's what brings me joy in the work that I do. It completely changed everything for me. And it was a long time thing. It's not like I woke up one day and said, "Oh, this is what I am." It's just the old time I learned that. And so the advice I would give to people is, figure it out. Like what, what type of leader do you want to be? And if you haven't done the reflection, like what you and I have talked about today, Christine, which is, who were the best bosses? Who were the worst bosses. If you have, that's the very next step it would be, if you've not done that. Do it, and then figure out which pieces of the puzzle you're going to bring forward in your life and make a conscious effort to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.

Tonya Campbell:
My advice in a nutshell.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. Thank you so much, Tanya. I know people are going to get a lot of value out of this, so thank you so much for coming on the show today.

Tonya Campbell:
Absolute pleasure. Thanks so much, Christine.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast
Episode: 6
Title: Recognizing greatness in others
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Sarah McVanel

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
So today I'm here with Sarah and I am going to let her introduce herself. But let me just tell you why I picked Sarah. So I really find Sarah's background amazing. She had a career in healthcare, life handed her a bit of a surprise, and all of a sudden she had to make a leap and transition into something that she could be her own best boss ever. What I thought was so cool, is she...

Sarah McVanel:
Yeah, exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
And you picked a topic of... I'll let everybody hear it from you, but you picked a topic that I think is so crucial to actually helping leaders become a Best Boss Ever as your passion and the focus of your business. So it just seemed like Sarah had to be on the show. So Sarah, thank you so much, and welcome.

Sarah McVanel:
Thanks for having me, Christine. I'm so glad you here.

Christine Laperriere:
Just tell Everybody really quick the name of your business, and just a little bit about yourself.

Sarah McVanel:
So my business is Greatness Magnified, and I'm Canada's recognition expert because what we consistently found in any team consultation, even if it was from an abundant place, the easiest way to gain collaboration, and build trust and momentum was through recognition. We tried all kinds of other things that would help too out of our deep toolkit in organizational development, and the one thing that always worked. And to your point around Best Boss Ever, why does it work for teams?

Sarah McVanel:
Because that's what makes people give their discretionary effort and make them want to do their best. And so not surprisingly, it's also what makes leaders great bosses. That's what I get a chance to do. I get to work with great bosses, great organizations through the exponential power of recognition.

Christine Laperriere:
That is amazing. And I know for me personally, recognition always was a big amplifier for sure during my corporate days. So start by telling us a little bit. When I asked you the question, who's your best boss ever, tell me who came to mind and why?

Sarah McVanel:
Well, I'm lucky that I had to really sift through a number of people. Aren't we all lucky to have many options. The one that really stands out in my mind is Louis Taylor Green, the current head of the Human Resource Professional Association of Ontario. And what made her my top choice was that when I had to share with her some pretty tricky notes.

Sarah McVanel:
So here she had lost her director of organizational development, so now she's got all of me and my colleagues, individual contributors reporting to her, she's a senior executive, she doesn't have time to meet one on one with us. But every week she made the time because she wanted to support us wholeheartedly to continue to do the great work we were doing. And also, because the organization so needed us in this massive of time of transformation.

Sarah McVanel:
And in one of those meetings, I had to tell her a local organization, another healthcare hospital, has asked me to come and start up the organizational development department, and I kept saying no, and they kept asking me. And I went for an interview and I've got the job, and it just seems like such a great opportunity. And I expected her to be so angry with me. This was a terrible time to leave.

Sarah McVanel:
And what she did was she pushed all of her papers aside, the list of things that we needed to talk about and the files that her and I had both brought to the table. And she said, "Okay, if you give me four weeks, the next four conversations we're going to have is about you and your next phase of your career." She just said, "I'll trust that you're going to hand over the projects. We don't need to talk about it anymore." And that's what she did.

Sarah McVanel:
She mentored me in having the Best Boss transition. That's what I'm calling it now. So for example, she helped me discern how to create a value proposition process. So when I started the organization, I initiated the first blush of people's experience of organizational development, was one of collaboration and support versus them resisting it, or me having to prove myself. She said, "Just believe that you're already there, and partnering with them and to serve them. So what would that look like?

Sarah McVanel:
And we co-created much with her guidance, the most amazing new way to not just start a department, but to start any job. And I have to tell you, I have led and mentored so many people in that process, all the down to Louise's supporting guidance.

Christine Laperriere:
So she's basically mentored you into a job with a different organization?

Sarah McVanel:
When it completely blindsided her. I had been in that organization for one year. It was too soon to leave, it was a bad time to leave. She was probably so busy. She had small children at home still, and she just realized my job is to support this person across from me.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. I find that amazing because one of the themes that's showing up as I'm sitting down and interviewing people about their best boss, is this commitment to the person in front of them, above and beyond their commitment to the business. I bet a lot of CEOs would be very scared to hear that. "Oh, by the way, these bosses, the reasons they're the best bosses is because they're committed to the person over the business." Actually the business.

Christine Laperriere:
But it's so fascinating because again, the impression that leaves on you and the way that you would reflect on that experience, that'd be a game changer.

Sarah McVanel:
Well, imagine how many people I now have the privilege as a professional speaker to tell about her. So a great example of that, because I speak for a lot of human resources groups and there's chapters across Ontario, we've got 22,000 HR professionals in Ontario alone, and it's obviously a designated profession. So to have that term, you need to get your CCEs. So as I'm going from chapter to chapter, especially when Louise was... It was announced that she was coming into this role, I said, "You are going to love what she's going to do. I know she's not in the role yet, but let me tell you."

Sarah McVanel:
And I not only would tell the board that, I would stand in front of the people there, whether it was 30 people or 300 people in the room, "Everybody, you wait until she starts. She is..." And I would use my version of the story of the Best Boss Ever. And then they all got excited because here's the head of the most important association of your career who has already demonstrated she is for the 'people'. So now she doesn't have to just be for the one person in that meeting, she just gets to be the person for 22,000 people in Ontario. They got pretty pumped.

Christine Laperriere:
Another thing that I have noticed in some of the trends of some of these discussions is again, the followership or the way that these things come back later in your career. I'm sure she wasn't thinking about what the return on investment was going to be as she gave you those four hours and she mentored you in that new role, but that again has been an amplifier for her because if she's done that for a number of people who have worked with her, what are they saying behind her back?

Christine Laperriere:
Free branding you've done for her just because you couldn't help it. That's genuinely how you feel. So it took no effort to say, "Oh, let me tell you about what an amazing leader she is." So I think that is an incredible story, and I think it's just such a good example of the selflessness that shows up in some of those best bosses that we hear about.

Sarah McVanel:
And you can't fake that. It didn't even take longer than half a second for her to push those papers aside. To your point around it amplifies and it becomes this reciprocal process, because she didn't think twice to support me. And again, that it wasn't from a self serving place. It wasn't, "Okay, well, how do I make myself look good? Or now I can put this on my resume that I mentor an X number of people." It's who she is.

Sarah McVanel:
And I think that's probably why she has taken this role as the head of our association, because she probably could make a lot more money working in the very senior roles that she's been in for the majority of her career. So Best Bosses Ever in my experience, as I say, I'm lucky to have many, they do things because it's the right thing to do. And by doing the right thing to do, people respect you, they talk about you, they want to do well by you. I'm sure because I've at times been the best boss ever. I've also been the worst boss ever.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, me too.

Sarah McVanel:
The whole effect of... But I model myself. I try to model... Including now when I have folks who work in my private business. You try to aspire to be like them. They are your muse of who you... Because you have actually a model. A frame of reference to use. And so your Best Bosses Ever, they stay alive. We remember, as you know from your neuroscience work, it's the neurolinguistic processing, all of that great juicy, yummy stuff that you do [inaudible 00:10:04] hard wire, really strong emotions. Best Bosses Ever, just like the worst bosses ever, they imprint themselves on our consciousness.

Sarah McVanel:
We pull them up, or the feelings that they had, that they created in us in micro moments, in longer term relationships, because it's such an emotionally laden experience. So anyone who's listening here, I would say what kind of emotional imprint are you making with the people who report to you, and frankly, that report with you. Because you never know. They could be your boss, you could be their boss one day.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. Things change quickly. I know that for sure. And you're right. I think that's actually one of the benefits that I'm really trying to drive with the work that I do with so many leaders, is that when you've worked for a Best Boss Ever, it's catchy. It's like we can't help ourselves, but mirror what we see in those Best Bosses Ever. And so I kind of feel like in my work, the bar is low often. We're just trying to make sure leaders aren't disruptive and that they don't have a lot of turnover, and we're just trying to basically help them meet the minimum bar of not being a worst boss.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's why I really came up with the name for the show, Best Boss Ever. Is how do we set the bar back up here again? Because I think the impact of those Best Bosses Ever is a giant multiplier. This isn't just about people feeling like they can come to work every day and they know what to get done. This is about people feeling like they would go the extra mile. They would walk on broken glass for that leader because that's how much they feel passionately. So that's your point about imprinting emotion. Is that they feel like I would do whatever it takes. [crosstalk 00:11:52].

Sarah McVanel:
For my whole career, that that person is... It's not a moment in time anymore. This person is part of your career legacy. And that's where recognition, it's such an easy thing to feel passionate about, and for me to have dedicated my speaking career, and sometimes working with some of those Best Bosses Ever to rebuild programs that authentically align to their leadership, their organization's desire to not just get through.

Sarah McVanel:
And as you and I both know that unfortunate statistic, that only 30% of north Americans are truly satisfied at work. So that's telling me in the context of our conversation, how many people are aspiring to be the Best Boss Ever. And perhaps more importantly, how many organizations are aspiring to enable people to be the Best Boss Ever. Because it's not bosses generally unless there's some really significant, bigger issue at play.

Sarah McVanel:
People want to do well. They want to get up and go to work, whether it's virtual and it's with your elastic pants on, or in your Armani suit at work, whatever that looks like. Bosses want to get up and do great work. They want to get their work done and feel a sense of accomplishment. They want to facilitate others to do meaningful work. They want to know notice greatness.

Sarah McVanel:
Unfortunately, a lot of great bosses work in not so great systems with too much work to do, and we owe it to great bosses to enable them to be that way. And when nothing else enables that to happen, what I tell those great bosses who want to do great work but they're greatly overwhelmed, forever recognize that there's greatness. Notice the small, seemingly invisible or microscopic examples of what's working well, things to acknowledge. That will give you the hope and the fuel, and the food for continuing in systems that are often not set up for people to lead and become the Best Boss Ever.

Christine Laperriere:
You're making me think of one of my experiences when I led a large team. I had one guy on my team, he was brand new, he was as green as green could be, but he would get up in the morning and be at the plant at 5:00 in the morning, and really was saying to the client, "We're here, we're serious. We're not just going to show up when it's convenient. We're going to show up when you're in business and you're doing the operation.

Christine Laperriere:
And so him being there at 5:00 in the morning and representing us was so important. He had had these incredibly long days, and I remember he was off to LA to go visit some family on a Thursday, and I said, "Hey, you know what? Why don't you catch the early flight and go? You've been working around the clock. Get there early enough that you can go have dinner with some sunshine." It's California. It was in the middle of the winter. And oh my goodness, did I take a giant lashing from my boss.?

Christine Laperriere:
So when my boss showed up that day, he said, "Where is this gentleman?" And I said I let him leave early, because he's been in at 5:00 and he's been doing great... He's new, so there's still a lot of things that he is trying to get up to speed on, but he's really been bringing his best self on tough hours. On hours that I can't even keep up with." And oh my goodness, did I ever get beat up over that one? And it really sent a message to me.

Christine Laperriere:
But when you made the comment about enabling people to be Best Boss Ever material, it just dawned on me, I haven't thought about that element of it and how I think for me, that was one of the most frustrating parts of being a leader, was that I felt like I was in an organization where they were more worried about me being too kind than... They were almost worried that somehow I was going to be so soft that all the results were going to fly out the window.

Christine Laperriere:
Meanwhile, my argument was exactly the opposite, where I was like, "Why don't you just let me do it my way, and let's prove it?" Because all I know is I was nominated for manager of the year, by the people who worked for me. "So let me prove it, and let me show you whether or not it works." But people were so scared that the results were going to drop on my team because I was doing things as thank yous. Non monetary things.

Sarah McVanel:
Love it. That's number one way people want it.

Sarah McVanel:
Well, right. Because they didn't hand me a bag of money to give out as gifts, and so I was always trying to come up with clever ways, and a lot of the times it might be a special occasion or some way that somebody could spend that extra evening with their family so that they could come back on Monday and feel like, "Hey, my boss gave me a little extra here this week, I'm going to give a little extra this week," and to create that trade. Anyway, I just think that is such an excellent point about enabling leaders to be a Best Boss Ever, and how important that is to the equation of actually being one.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you for sharing that story, and I'm so glad that you're the type of individual type of human that's willing to risk being raked over the coals by your boss to do the right thing. And I know I've even had that experience with peers in my last senior leadership role. If we had an issue at senior team on Tuesday that we didn't know how to fix, because frankly, most of the time you don't. If it was that easy to fix, it probably wouldn't make it to senior team and it wouldn't be something we have to revisit the next week.

Christine Laperriere:
So every Friday I had the whole day blocked, and I'd spend part or all of it shadowing somebody at the front line who knew more about this situation because they were living it every day. So we had beds backed up in the ER, or we had an infection outbreak on one unit but not the parallel unit, or we're having an increase in number of complaints of a particular area. I'd go and I would spend time in whatever they wore, tennis shoes and scrubs, or my normal clothes if that's what needed it.

Christine Laperriere:
And people would tell me stuff. People didn't initially feel like I was there to help and understand and serve. They initially were suspicious. So what does that say about us as leaders? I don't just mean in that organization, because I think that that would happen across many organizations if not almost all, is people would be suspicious. "Why is the boss showing up?" But what I found is, I could get over that suspicion pretty quickly and word gets around.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, she's poking her nose in on Fridays. It's just because she's learning something and she's curious and she wants to help. Here's the other thing though. Christine, I don't know if you've heard this, my peers didn't like it. I could get over the not liking it initially from the staff, because if banning only the holdouts for the people would be negative anyway. It was my peers who didn't want me to 'make them look bad.' And I'd say, "Well go and shadow them." And we're all busy.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm not trying to minimize, they're doing the best they can. They're leading the way they felt they needed to lead. However, if you want to be the Best Boss Ever, it often takes courage to be different, and to say, "I don't think we're leading in the best way. I don't think that this is helping. I don't know if our customers are happy with us."

Christine Laperriere:
So you have to be sometimes willing to be the worst colleague ever. Report ever the worst advocate ever, or the best advocate ever to be seen as the worst collaborator ever. Because it's not a nice, tight, discrete parts. It's not like, "Oh, if I become the best boss ever, that equates to the best..." Fill in the blank.

Christine Laperriere:
No, it's controversial. And that's why I actually love this topic because it isn't black and white. Just like you said, being a best boss can get you in trouble in different parts. Like you said, when you're really hunting for truth, sometimes that can cause trouble in other camps. So sometimes it's really how are you able to navigate so many different variables at the same time? So anything come to mind when you think of your worst boss ever?

Sarah McVanel:
Oh yes, absolutely. Ironically, it's the person that I reverted to and my husband reports to. We met in the restaurant industry, and he was managing a restaurant by the worst human ever; not just boss. This person would rival insert who you think is the worst human ever, he's beside that person. She just happens to be less famous. So you think your worst human ever, she's up wherever they go after you leave this earth, she's hanging out with them and having a really awful dinner.

Sarah McVanel:
And so Mark and I talk about her still at the dinner table, and we use this as an education with our kids about you do not need to be treated badly or work in an unsafe environment. So here's the worst, worst boss ever. So she initially hires people based on their looks, first of all, so discriminatory. So I guess I got enough of a pass that I made it through the door.

Christine Laperriere:
That's how you met your handsome husband, right?

Sarah McVanel:
That's how I met my handsome husband. Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
I was just going to say not so bad after all.

Sarah McVanel:
Okay. So maybe I shouldn't use her as an example. You never knew. She was one of those folks you never knew what you're going to get. Occasionally she would be sweet as sticky syrup and you were like, "Oh gosh, what happened?" And you tippy toe around. More often if she came by, it was like a thunder cloud. And she was this tiny, probably half my size. If the wind blew, she'd blow over. Just this tiny, tiny lady.

Sarah McVanel:
But her volatile emotions and presence was enough to scare even the customers. And why? So nobody complained. She could control everybody underneath her thumb, and she worked all the time. She was a very unhappy person, and we all knew that that's why she was the way she was. But she made people climb up. If the gutters were blocked, she'd say go climb up that raggedy ladder, and you could fall off. If the cooler was not working properly in the fridge and the food got mold on it, she'd say scrape it off and serve it anyway.

Sarah McVanel:
Firstly always was dirty because she had to buy the cheapest parsley ever, and we had to 'conserve water' so it didn't get washed properly. And I would have to... [crosstalk 00:22:59]. Yes. I would have to go and feed it to the people. She didn't always get the linen properly washed. I was just gross. It was gross, and so was so cruel. She would [crosstalk 00:23:13] feel like the smallest person ever. And if a customer complained, because we worked in [inaudible 00:23:19] lake, so you often wouldn't see these people back and this was pre Yelp days, she didn't care if she dressed you down.

Sarah McVanel:
If you complain, Christine, she'd say, "You know what? You're the little tiny woman and I don't need to deal with this. I run this big, successful restaurant. I don't care what you think." She'd actually insult you to your face in front of your [crosstalk 00:23:39].

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Sarah McVanel:
And people would have their jaws sitting on the sticky table.

Christine Laperriere:
After eating their dirty parsley.

Sarah McVanel:
Their dirty parsley, they're moldy buns. It was terrible.

Christine Laperriere:
That is unbelievable, and creates, I bet, a very rich conversation around dinner. I don't know if I'd lose my appetite talking about that too much. [crosstalk 00:24:08]. That's right. That's exactly right. It could be much worse, kids, if you don't like this.

Sarah McVanel:
It could be much worse. There's nothing moldy here. Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
But it's just interesting. So I have two questions about that, and the first is, people don't treat people like that unless there's... We already know hurt people hurt people is the way it works. Any guesstimate as to where some of that toxicity really, at the end of the day, came from?

Sarah McVanel:
Well, I probably have greater insight because my husband did work as her right hand, and he never put up with her nonsense, which is, I think, the only reason why he was able to do that. So he had a bigger window. Her husband, unfortunately he had an addiction to alcohol and he was a player, and would constantly cheat on her and she put up with that. Twitched his or her own, if that's fine for you, that's fine... [crosstalk 00:25:01].

Christine Laperriere:
Awful marriage at home.

Sarah McVanel:
Unfortunately, I think in her case though, she just felt she had to find another outlet. He made her feel terrible, and he ignored her and he was often away, so she then... It was actually correlated. The more he would behave in a certain way, she would behave in a certain way. The other thing was she had three children and all of them hated her. So that also was an indication that there's something not great with relationships and the way you are with people.

Sarah McVanel:
So the chicken or the egg, is that their behavior or their detesting of their mom creates her to be not nice to us, or did something have to happen to create all three children being... And they don't talk. They didn't go to her funeral, they never were by the bedside when she had a stroke.

Christine Laperriere:
That's awful. I think that there was a very unhappy family dynamic by the time I joined the organization, and that's unfortunately sometimes the case, I don't know how often.

Sarah McVanel:
Well, again, it just speaks to some of the things when you start thinking about what enables a best boss ever. When we look at what's happening at home, it definitely pours through into how we lead, and lots of leaders will tell you when they are unhappy, how hard it is. This definitely sounds like a much more amplified case, but it's just interesting because many of us, and I know myself included, when things aren't great at home, that frustration still shows up everywhere else too.

Sarah McVanel:
I've had a great boss who shared with me some lessons learned from stories and situations, so maybe the part B to that, which I so appreciate your reflection, is who chooses to take those challenging experiences and use those as lessons to more junior folks to elevate them to learn like, "This is what I went through. Maybe you can learn from that." As opposed to it become you now get to be victimized by my sense of injustice or unhappiness in the world. We don't all come out of this world unscarred or with life being a fairytale. So how do you choose use your message your message?

Sarah McVanel:
Do you make it extra messy, or do you help other people to leverage or to work through challenging times?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Excellent. Well, this has been absolutely lovely talking to you today. I'm just smiling because I had a few Aha moments myself, so I've written them down and I'll be thinking about them as I reflect on our call. It was great to hear your story about Louise, and again, I really appreciate the work you're doing around recognition, and how you're helping leaders build that into their practice, because again, I think we'll have more Best Boss Ever candidates if we can find more people who are willing to build strong recognition skills. So thank you Sarah so much. [crosstalk 00:28:11].

Sarah McVanel:
The easiest way. Yeah, my pleasure. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you. Have a good one. Take care. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com, and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Title: Keep calm and carry on
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Steve Robert

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So Steve, welcome to the show. And just as we're getting started, I have to explain why I'm so excited to have you specifically on the show. So we've had the opportunity to work together for over 10 years. I was thinking about it just this morning going, "Wow, it's been that long." And we've also had the chance to work on big account strategies together, looking at how do we transform sales organizations. So we've really gotten a chance to get into the weeds of a lot of work over the last 10 years. And so it just seemed like, I know that we've already had this conversation about what those best bosses look like and how do we bring some of that spirit to the work world. So it just seemed like you'd be the perfect guest for this show. So thank you so much for coming out.

Steve Robert:
Thanks so much for having me Christine. And, yeah, we've been working together for a long time, so appreciate that. And really looking forward to doing this and having this conversation.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm just going to dive in because you know, I don't waste any time. So I can't wait to hear, tell me about your best boss ever.

Steve Robert:
Sure. Best boss ever was back, I'm going to say well over 10 years ago, when I worked with a food equipment manufacturer. This person just really did a phenomenal job in kind of shaping the future of my career path. And he did it in many different ways, but I would say the biggest thing for me was his ability to listen and engage. And those things for me were really powerful because he would be able to listen to a situation that I had encountered which at the time I felt was catastrophic, if you will. And really just getting emotional into the moment. And he was just so phenomenal at boiling things down, calming it down, distilling what the issues were and trying to work with me to find a solution. And that was incredibly powerful.

Steve Robert:
He did it with me, but he also did it with the other folks that reported directly into him. And I think that really helped to shape the future. From my perspective, it really opened my eyes as to what being a real leader is. And I've never forgotten it because I've also experienced the other side where you have a boss that doesn't listen so well. I definitely draw on the positives from my best boss ever.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. I think that's such a good example, where you're talking about you're getting emotional, you're getting fired up. And one thing I know in my own experience I get, especially earlier in my career, very emotional, very fired up about different topics and different issues, which is really just a sign of high employee engagement. But with the wrong boss, they deflate that, right. They almost crush your employee engagement because you care so much. But this one sounds like he was able to do quite the opposite. Like he was still able to leverage that engagement, but just redirect the energy.

Steve Robert:
Yes, very much so. And I think the one thing that he made me aware of is self-awareness. Having emotional intelligence to kind of look at a situation holistically versus just in that particular moment. And the biggest thing for me is if you hit the challenge or hit a wall, it doesn't mean that you stop there. You just got to find a way around or over the wall to get to that end game. I think those are the of positive draws. On the other side, you're right. If you don't have your best boss ever, and you're confronted with situations, gosh, you hate to feel badly about making a mistake because at the end of the day I think making a mistake is an opportunity to learn and draw from that. It's experience.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Steve Robert:
And we all have experience which means we've all experienced failure.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely. Can you tell me a little bit about, give me just the nature of what that conversation looks like when your best boss ever is talking to you and you're really riled up about an issue. Just give me a little bit more detail. What is that conversation really look like?

Steve Robert:
Sure. I mean, I can think of a very good example where we had an account where it just meant a lot to us from a revenue perspective, things were not going well and it wasn't a result of our engagement, but as a result of some failures in terms of the equipment that we were providing this particular customer with. And I'll tell you, if you're leading sales and you're faced with this consequence of your biggest account threatening to leave, I was hot. And it was very simple, he just stayed so calm and said, "Okay, let's whiteboard this situation." And he took this very calm approach and current situation and drew out the path to the best possible outcome.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. That's awesome. Okay. So whiteboard, I'm making a note here because I love a whiteboard.

Steve Robert:
I do too. It's my friend. It's my friend.

Christine Laperriere:
I know. I've had quite many jokes about my obsessions with whiteboards. But that's brilliant. So he stayed very calm while you were extremely riled up and upset about the potential of losing this account. And then it sounds like the whiteboard gave him an opportunity to start to draw out what was in your head, what your concerns were, right?

Steve Robert:
It was exactly like that. But more importantly, it was for me to also gain some clarity from the whiteboard exercise. I was beginning to see that it wasn't as catastrophic as I thought, there was a way to fix it. Obviously no one wants to hear that your largest customer's upset and they're threatening to potentially leave you as a customer, no one wants that. But that whiteboard exercise, while it was important for him to draw out the facts, it was really therapeutic for me to see that there was a very clear path to overcome this. In the moment I didn't see it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Steve Robert:
And that's one of the great things that I learned from him. And I've really taken that to the next level as my career has moved on.

Christine Laperriere:
That is excellent. And that is such a good story, because again, I always say, it's how do we put it into motion? It's not just we need trust or we need good listening skills. Like, this is exactly how he listened. This is the tactical nature of how he listened. But also how he, I think he protected your engagement in the situation, which I think is important. Because just to say, "Hey Steve, just calm down, this isn't a big deal." He could have easily just said, "This isn't that big a deal. You're just riled up right now. Just calm down." But instead he didn't, he honored where you were at. And then he said, "Okay, let's work together so I can show you some clarity to where we're going"

Steve Robert:
That's exactly what he did. And as I said earlier, he did it for everyone he interacted with. And that's the powerful piece because he created a really dynamic and engaged team that was working in lockstep with one another. So there weren't any silos. And that was really important because as a leadership team, you're able to filter down or advocate team synergy. And team doesn't mean just your department. It means the entire company. It was incredibly important, a great lesson, because I've seen the alternative where it's not so great.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You know, I think you bring up a really interesting point about the consistency of treating everyone the same way. Because it could have been easy for him to go "Oh, well here I have this very dynamic, very ambitious salesperson. I'm going to spend time nurturing them, but the rest of my team, maybe they're not worth the time." I've seen that a lot. Right?

Steve Robert:
Sure, sure. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Where we choose to be the best boss ever for our favorites and then save that energy from the rest and I'm hearing that that was not the case.

Steve Robert:
Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I mean, when you really kind of stop and think about this best boss ever concept, I can't even put a price tag on that as I evaluate. As I got prepared for this thinking about best boss ever versus alternatives, and there's just a clear difference in working for that best boss ever. I've learned from those experiences. And the big thing that I drew on this is the self-awareness piece and really striving to continuously learn from each experience because we're going to continually grow and run into new experiences. And it's being able to stop and reevaluate and really be self aware of how you dealt with the situation, how it could have been dealt with differently.

Christine Laperriere:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excellent. So do you have any stories, it doesn't have to be related to this one, but one where you worked for a leader and it was, we can gossip a little bit about maybe arguably, maybe a worse boss or maybe, in your world, not a favorite. Like a specific story or something that comes to mind when I think of those.

Steve Robert:
Yeah, for sure. I can definitely think of one and I think it's all the opposite of everything I talked about. It's disengaged. It's doing exactly, as you said, not really listening to the situations like it's not that bag go figure it out, that type of approach. Because you don't really need help at this level, you're our leader, you don't need help. And that type of mindset can really kind of diminish, I would say, team synergy, team productivity that alignment within the organization. And for me, it is just such a clear difference. Really makes it challenging to really kind of get your team focused on driving those results. When, gosh, you're not really working together at the top to cultivate this spirit of overcoming challenges.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. So when you see the silos in motion and you can't bring them down because the leaders aren't talking to each other. Right?

Steve Robert:
Very, very difficult. Very frustrating. And I think you hit on a very key point, it does create disengagement. As I thought about this last night, getting ready for this morning, I was like, "Wow." I remember feeling tired and unproductive and drained from that experience because I did care. And I did want to do really, really well for my team, for myself, for the organization. And I really kind of refer to that experience as a boss that was a diminisher if you will, a diminisher of what you're trying to accomplish.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. As soon as you say that, I think of leaders that I worked for, especially early in my career and I was so passionate and so committed to making that business the best business it could be. And it was just so interesting how many leaders were just like, "Oh, calm down, don't work so hard. You're taking this almost a little too seriously."

Steve Robert:
Yeah. And there's nothing worse than that when you really care. That's a terrible, terrible feeling when you really care and you hear that message. It's tough. It's tough.

Christine Laperriere:
So, okay. So just to summarize, if you were to offer a piece of advice for anybody that's listening right now, and they are truly committed to trying to be a best boss, what would you tell them? Like give them really tactical tips on what you would tell them to do next.

Steve Robert:
Yeah. First thing is, reflect. So what were your experiences? So let's really reflect on who your best boss was or is versus the alternatives that we just covered and really draw on that. And I think the second one is really be self aware of how you engage in situations. Because I think that's really important is being able to walk away from different situations and evaluate how you handled it. Did you do the best that you could? Especially if you're getting feedback that basically draws out opportunities for improvement, think about those things and really, really focus on them. That self-awareness piece, you can't put a price tag on that. And the third thing I'd say is solicit the feedback. I think it's really important that you encourage the feedback to come from team members, so same level, but also the people that report into you. That's really important to give them the confidence to want to speak up to you. Because that in itself is priceless. If you can create an environment where people feel comfortable to give you the straight good feedback, you will be by far a much better leader for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. I think even given that too, I have to add in here, I really love your story about your best boss, who took a very calm approach when you were upset, but also did not deflect your emotion. Like I think there's something really emotionally intelligent about that response to an employee who's highly engaged, but is truly concerned at a very deep level and comes into the room and says "The sky is falling. The sky is falling." And without undermining your experience, he was able to stay rooted, walk you through the experience, teach you something really important about the experience, but never disengaging you or telling you that you shouldn't think or feel the way you did.

Steve Robert:
I totally agree. And just sitting here talking about this brings a smile to my face, because I work so hard trying to get to that place where I can be as calm and collected as he is and still is today. And again, that self-awareness journey is critically important. We got to learn from each situation. But it is unbelievable just thinking about how great he is at engaging with people and helping to overcome issues and the way he does it. His disposition just being so genuinely calm and really wanting to help you fix something. It's fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. What a great show. Thank you very much for those nuggets of wisdom. I'm smiling because I'm thinking already about where I can apply some of the things that you just talked about today. So I really enjoyed this chat, Steve, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Steve Robert:
Thanks Christine. It's always a pleasure.

Christine Laperriere:
All right. Have a good one. Take care.

Steve Robert:
Okay, you too.

Title: The value of "I don't know"
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Eric Wasser

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
Eric, thank you so much for coming on the show. I am going to start by sharing why I invited you on the show and I have had the opportunity to work with you at our days at Miller Heiman. Wow. Back 2008, I think, might have been the start of that for me anyway. So it was lovely because I just remember one of the things that I saw in you was just an incredible passion for people, passion for leadership and passion for sales. You just ooze that anytime that I've been around you and just a real commitment to paying attention and engaging with the people around you. So I feel like you would be a great person to interview on the Best Boss Ever show, so thank you.

Eric Wasser:
Well, thanks for having me and I could mirror all that back to you as to how excited I was to accept the invitation. So awesome to be able to talk to you and I really enjoyed the time that we did share, professionally speaking.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. So I'm going to dive in as I'm so curious on your thoughts. So tell us what would be an example of your best boss ever, if you can think back on that?

Eric Wasser:
I can. As I should have, I prepared a bit so that I'd know exactly at least who, and from a profile standpoint, I wanted to talk about. And I'm actually going to name this person by name because I think that they deserve it and would like to have their name recognized in this way. I had a couple of opportunities to work for this person. His name is Jason Reed. Worked for him. He was a senior leader for a company called Office Depot, which many people have heard of in their commercial division. And then later crossover with him as he held a leadership position at Miller Heiman Group, where we shared some time as well.

Eric Wasser:
And there were a lot of reasons that I selected him. In your descriptions of these, you say, you're going to hear stories and you're going to hear how these leaders made people feel. And so, as broad as that is, he made me feel great. He made me feel smart, made me feel valued and then something we can certainly unpack in more detail and important for me, he made me feel safe. And there's just a lot of thought leadership right now about how safety breeds innovation and you have to have a culture of creativity and idea sharing. And I thought he just did an outstanding job with that.

Christine Laperriere:
That is excellent. And I'm smiling because I know Jason Reed. So yet again, I love when these interviews extend into leaders that I've actually worked with. So I think this is excellent. I can't wait to hear more. So you talked about, he made you feel smart, he made you feel valued and he made you feel safe. I'd love you to explain in more detail, especially each one of those traits. What specifically did he do?

Eric Wasser:
I think these hallmark characteristics, I know are ones you've likely heard from other participants in the podcast, right, but I'm going to hone in on the notion of safety because for me, it was especially important. I came to realize in my professional career that I suffered something that many do called imposter syndrome. It doesn't mean that you're not capable. It certainly doesn't mean that you're not able to execute. It just means that occasionally you might feel like you're not delivering the value that you were intended to. And I just thought that Jason did such an outstanding job of being able to shepherd me through those moments where I felt fraudulent, even if I wasn't, and really unlock the potential for me to really capitalize on where I was good. And I could tell you it started from the very first time I met him in the interview process.

Eric Wasser:
So I went to the interview, flew into Florida to talk to him and a couple of other folks and like is often the case we had a couple of hours scheduled, but I remember he and his partners were posing incredibly difficult questions. Ones to which I had no real great answer and I remember regularly answering it first by saying, I'm not sure, or I don't know, or I'll have to think about that. And at the conclusion of that first hour, I was thinking, geez, I didn't hit the mark here. I just wasn't able to give good concrete answers. And I'll never forget him inviting in one of his senior leaders toward the end of that hour and saying, listen, I want you to meet this guy, Eric. He had the best answers to some of our questions because they all started with, I don't know, or I'll have to think about that.

Eric Wasser:
And he said, we're wrestling with very difficult challenges here and we're looking to divine and design approaches that other organizations haven't tackled or taken. So we're really looking for somebody who wants to get involved in that way, rather than somebody that thinks they have all the answers. So he had me hooked right from the beginning, if that makes sense?

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that is fantastic. That is such a good example. I thought what you were going to say, I'm going to admit out loud, that I thought what you were going to say is that he coached you on not starting your answers that way and so I'm smiling over here because the brilliance of being able to appreciate when people start by admitting that they don't know and then talking out loud about what they think. We don't acknowledge what a good trait that actually is.

Eric Wasser:
I agree. And I think it really leads to some of his characteristics and I would characterize him as an egoless leader and that comes up a lot. And so for me to give that some definition, at least from my perspective could be important. It's not that Jason didn't have an ego. He was a highly, highly confident person and you might remember that. And he had a nice big ego, but not when it came to trying to tackle problems or pretending he had the answers to everything. And so his level of vulnerability in recognizing that if he didn't have the answers, he wanted thought partners to help him figure those answers out, was second to none in my career. And I think that's kind of a great way to think about how he unlocked that potential for safety and this feeling that your opinions and your thoughts and how you wanted to approach things would be valued.

Eric Wasser:
And so right from that interview, I felt that, but there were moments where he wasn't shy about giving me direct coaching as well. So you mentioned that. I'd share one that's kind of in keeping with this conversation. So as part of imposter syndrome, he would regularly say I could show up from time to time with these very, very strong and probably correct opinions, but I would all shucks my way through it. Those were his words, right, and I remember him sitting down and saying, stop. No, all shucks. And it became a regular affirmation, if you will, for us over the years that we work together that occasionally, figuratively, as I was going out the door and he would say, hey, no, all shucks, right? Just a reminder to go in there and have the confidence that I should. And I think the reason it was important is I spent a good bit of time as a first line leader, but when I went to work for Jason it was my first exposure to becoming a second line leader in the path to senior leadership.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great and it's funny that you're talking about imposter syndrome because I obviously have a heavy focus on women's leadership. We talk about imposter syndrome a lot, but I love to hear male perspective because my argument has always been that imposter syndrome. It hits a lot of us. It is. It's an interesting phenomenon, if you want to call it that?

Eric Wasser:
And I think the reason that leadership plays such a role in helping what are often very talented people, not that I'm talking about myself, but very talented people who might suffer it is most people could feel very fierce about their belief and self, but a core level. And most people professionally, especially if they've ascended first line to second line, certainly know how to project confidence on the far outside, but you spend most of your time between those two extremes, right? And so if you work with a boss long enough, invariably you have to expose that middle ground. And if you're working with bosses with whom you think you're always supposed to have the answers or have things for figured out, or you get chastised for not having the answers, that makes it hard for you to be vulnerable, to fail, to share bold and big ideas.

Eric Wasser:
And I think that's what Jason did a really good job of unlocking. I'll remember and I'll just give you one anecdote. One of the things that he did regularly with us as a team, he had five or seven direct reports and he was senior vice president role at the time, would be to bring us in to Florida, and I know that's not taking places regularly today, but it would be a virtual meeting today, and express to us exactly what he was wrestling with from his perspective back to the business.

Eric Wasser:
And he would say, I've taken it this far. And he'd give us his perspective. And then he would leave the room for hours and say, I'd like you guys to wrestle with this and try to solve for these things and when I come back, let's talk about how we blend the thoughts that I've had with the thoughts you have and what our plan to bring that back to the business will be. And that just became a regular staple of the way he ran his team meetings when we got together live was to offload almost the real challenge of the business to us and let us wrestle with it. That was phenomenal.

Christine Laperriere:
That's so smart. It sounds like a lot of these practices, again, really tap into the innovation capability of the team in the collective genius, instead of it just being kind of one person's genius.

Eric Wasser:
And I know that your roles in this notion of best boss transcend sales, I've spent the majority of my career in sales, but one thing for sure today, it definitely takes teaming and collaboration to do it successfully. And so for him to be a pioneer in that direction, I think was really important. One of the things you and I talked about in advance, as we thought about this podcast was how did these ideas and these practices influence me? Well, I made that a staple in how I've run my teams ever since. I don't come with all the answers. If I came all the answers and all I was looking for was validation, I don't need a team. Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
So being willing and able to be vulnerable yourself as a leader, bring the challenges that you're trying to solve for to a team and getting people to collaborate around it is an imperative today.

Christine Laperriere:
And I'm curious, as you know I'm in the space of working with leaders and I always bump up against this argument of what's the return on investment. I had a client at the end of last year who wanted me to give out a detailed return on investment of the investment in his leaders being best bosses. And so my question to you, because I'm still trying to figure out how to quantify it, how would you put a measure to Jason's impact to the business in the way that he led?

Eric Wasser:
It's a great question and certainly I don't have a mathematical answer, but I can tell you this, you don't want to bring new people on and train them. Plenty of thought leadership surrounding that people don't leave jobs, they leave the bosses, right? And I can unequivocally tell you that the team that I worked with that surrounded Jason were fiercely loyal to him and prevented a lot of turnover in a very uncertain set of circumstances. When you're trying to tackle something new, you need continuity, you need fortitude and you need teams to come together over longer periods of time than six months or a year to really solve for big profound issues and his ability to keep people intact was also second to none. So I'm not sure exactly how you quantify that unless you look at it account by account or business by business, but being able to keep people is an extremely important part of leadership and being a boss.

Christine Laperriere:
And it's funny that you say that because retention, I've argued retention before, and some people will say, oh, well, we have great retention so what does that matter? But engagement is so hard to, like you said, there's not a mathematical answer, but the ability to hold a team together who continues to fight during a long, difficult challenge, there is numbers there somewhere. We just don't have the alternate reality of what happens when a team continues to fall apart over and over and over again, right?

Eric Wasser:
It speaks to loyalty and I like the way you're framing that in a fierceness and passion toward whatever you're trying to deliver back to the business, right? Everybody coming together for those things and sometimes it takes leaders making tough decisions themselves on what they get behind and what narratives they give back to the business. One of the things I remember well about Jason is how much he would defend us as a team, the things we were working on and our own perspectives and he was particularly good at managing up.

Eric Wasser:
He was fearless about managing up. He would do it sometimes at his own detriment. I'm not going to give the circumstances that surround the story or exactly what company I was working for at the time. I did say I worked for him at two different occasions, but I remember one of my peers stumbling quite mightily on a personal front, making a series of personal mistakes that it influenced some things at business. Nothing that I would say made it incredibly impropitious, putting anyone at danger, but it was the kind of thing where a judgment call had to be made on whether or not this person should stay.

Eric Wasser:
And Jason was willing to take that message up on this person's behalf. Ultimately, the business made the decision that this person could not continue, but his willingness to do so spoke volumes about his willingness to support his people.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
You hear that a lot in all forms of leadership. He wasn't reckless, he wasn't trying to defend something that made no sense to defend, so I need to get that out there, but it was an opportunity where he could have easily just taken the easy route and said, corporate says, but he didn't and he was willing to do that. And he did that quite regularly, even with compensation.

Christine Laperriere:
And you talk about safety. Also, what mindset does that bring if you know that your leader is going to fight for you to the death, right? You know that they are going to go to bat for you in a way that is fierce, I think is the word you said. What does that do when you're working for someone like that to your mindset?

Eric Wasser:
I think safety is such an important word, which is why I sort of led with it, right, and a lot of thought leadership talks about you got to unlock innovation and creativity by creating it and what does it mean? And so it doesn't mean that I always felt that my job was safe. In a sales profession, you do have to deliver on results and metrics, right, but I was safe in that I could share ideas, even if they weren't good. I could have micro failures. I'm going to use your word from before. And that was okay because you can't succeed without a few failures and I never felt like I had to have all the answers. And if you can foster a culture like that, then I think you're a great boss. I think you'll get the most out of people and all you're ever trying to do is optimize the performance of your team, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, this is great. I am really enjoying this. So now, if you were to look at, you don't have to definitely name any names, but I always say working for leaders that weren't your best. You don't have to rank them or anything like that, but the ones that weren't your favorite, what is the thing that you observed or learned from them? Because we learn a lot from our not favorite bosses too.

Eric Wasser:
We do. And it's easy to paint the picture of the opposite, but I'm going to come back to what I tied to, to develop some passion for having this conversation. How does a boss make you feel? Right? And so I can think of one in particular, but several, but I can think of one in particular that just had an act for making me feel like my contribution wasn't that important and then I was dispensable. And I'm going to give you one particular story. I just find it interesting. I was making my first transition from first line to second line leadership. I was about 30 years old and I was doing some open water swimming at that point in my life and I had somehow contracted a little bug, a stomach bug, and it was pretty profound though, because I remember being at a client's office.

Eric Wasser:
I know this is a little weird. So sorry to the audience, but I was at a client's office and got a call from the public health department in the state of Texas. They had chased me down. This was pre everyone having a cell phone at their disposal. And I remember them tracking me down and saying, you've got this bug, it's contagious. You might want to think about getting some medication. You're not in urgent or dire circumstances, but we want to get it addressed. When the health department takes the time to track you down while you're mobile, and you're in a different part of the state, it begs of pretty important circumstances. So I called this particular boss at the time and I remember explaining to them the situation that I had just gotten the call. And I was due to go to one of our largest partners that next day to do a partner review.

Eric Wasser:
And I remember this boss saying, oh, well, you'll be able to take care of that when you get home. And the assumption that I was still going to go to this partner the next day. And I just felt like that was not in my service. And I'm a bit ashamed to say, I made a very poor decision at that time to call the partner and do something I would never ordinarily do and I'm just pointing out that it created unnatural behaviors by me because the way it made me feel. I asked this partner to express that I had come out there for the partner review, even though I had no intention of doing so because I needed to go home and get this addressed and get on the medication. I put the partner in an uncomfortable position, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
And I wish I could get that decision back. I later apologize to that partner for making such a poor decision, but I say these were the downstream byproducts of that kind of leadership that was more about results rather than the people and how they feel.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Eric Wasser:
So it wasn't that long after that, frankly, that I was interviewing with Jason and saying, I don't know.

Christine Laperriere:
What a great story though. And I appreciate you sharing it, even though it admits a bad decision on your part, but to your exact point. And I guess this is why I'm so passionate about this topic is that you can see how here we have this person who's got fantastic potential. You've proven it. So we know that at 30 you had it because you've proven it in your career, but the irony is that again, working for someone who didn't allow to feel like you could be authentic and prioritize yourself and what was important to you. Again, business first and at the expense of your personal health in this case, right?

Christine Laperriere:
It's just interesting how it does. As humans, we either push back or we try somehow to fold into the pretzel, right, which is kind of what you were doing. It's like you were somehow trying to figure out how to keep him happy, but still honor your health and you had to do it by being inauthentic somehow. Or asking someone else to be inauthentic for you. And it just goes to speak to what culture is. People don't understand what culture is and it's those little tiny decisions that all stack up because if you were doing that, every other person and that reported to that leader was doing something like that.

Eric Wasser:
No doubt. And I can assure you, they were.

Christine Laperriere:
That's exactly right.

Eric Wasser:
One of the words you used as part of this, and I know it's affectionately related to the podcast, is do a little gossiping, right? A lot of that took place around this particular leader in their predisposition around results over all things, right? And results are certainly important, but at the time to your point, and it's not about me, I was number two in the country at my job function and I decided to take that skillset and my ascension elsewhere because I wasn't able to be the authentic me, good word by you, and compare and contrast that to pretty quickly later being an environment where people were fighting on other people's behalf, even when they made a mistake, and I had made a mistake at that point. No one knew about it. It didn't become public that I had done that, but it just made me feel great about where I was and it made me want to do the right thing always on this person's behalf.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you have any words of wisdom that you want to pass along to anyone that's listening right now, give us, what do you think? There's lots of us out there that are trying to be better leaders. So what can we take from what you've learned?

Eric Wasser:
I think I'm not suggesting that it has to always be about people and you can't manage to performance, because there are opportunities to be direct and give input and feedback, but look for those moments to engage your teams around the work and not after you've figured out what you think the answers to the test are. If you can tie people personally to the work, make them feel invested and give them opportunities to have their voices heard, you'll create fierceness and loyalty. And that's how I felt and as a result, I've followed Jason to two different companies, stay in touch with him to this day and try to maintain contact on a professional basis. I know that's over simple.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's the irony as most of these things are, right? They always sound common sense, but when we're out there working every day with leaders, we know for a fact that they're not common. Excellent. Thank you, Eric. This was so much fun to talk to you. I really appreciate it.

Eric Wasser:
Thanks Christine. Love the opportunity. Thank you.

Podcast: Best Boss Ever Podcast
Episode: 9
Title: Caring for your employees
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Laura Joudrey

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome. I am so excited to have Laura Joudrey on the show today. And I just have to start by explaining why I invite each guest on the show. And I had a recent conversation with Laura, and as we were just getting to know each other, she was telling me a little bit about Extend Communications, where she works. And she really had my attention when she started talking about how she's been part of this organization and they've been really focused on creating a great culture. Then she went on to tell me that they also have incredibly low turnover, which is interesting because this business is based around a call center. So I've had some experience with call centers in the past and by nature, that role can be very demanding for individuals.

Christine Laperriere:
And typically it's a high turnover environment. So when she was mentioning this idea of there being great culture, that was very intentionally created and how low the turnover was. I was so curious to learn more that I asked her to come on the show and not only tell us a little bit about your best boss, but tell us a bit about how your organization has been able to accomplish these things. So thank you so much for being on the show, Laura.

Laura Joudrey:
Oh, thank you for inviting me. Again, yes, I'm Laura, and I work for Extend Communications. My title there is CFO and I've worked for 19 years and I love my job.

Christine Laperriere:
I always get excited when I hear someone say they love their job, that you just triggered too a memory because I think you said that when we were talking too, I know you said, "Oh, I, I have to know more." So I'll start by the first question which we always love to start with is to first tell me a little bit about your best boss ever and/or bosses.

Laura Joudrey:
I have had actually two best bosses. They both have really shaped not just my professional life, but my personal life as well. So the first was when I first started actually back in the workforce, full-time after having a family, and this boss was a controller of a large US corporation, which was a very competitive corporation. He gave me an opportunity that I probably wasn't qualified to do, but he had confidence in me. And I think from him, he really encouraged me down the path that my career took today. But more than that, he was so interested and about my success and how I was doing. The thing. I remember the very most about him and that I have always tried to practice in what I do in my career is he was so super busy.

Laura Joudrey:
And every time I wrapped on his door to have a question or I didn't understand something, he was swamp with papers, just piled everywhere on his desk and he would just put them aside and he'd go sit down, and I had his undivided attention every time. He made me feel like I was the most important person, that I was valued, and that what I had to say mattered, and that I deserve to be listened to. That is something that I've taken away with me in my personal life and in my professional life. And I've tried to do it with my kids. I've tried to do it with the people that I work with. Of course, my husband might say, that's not quite true, but he might be the only one that complains about it. But I always do, try to focus when somebody's talking to me. And that's what I took away from that best boss ever.

Laura Joudrey:
And he was great. He was a great person to work with. So my second boss, best boss ever is, of course, why I love my job today, and the owner of Extend Communications, Scott Lyons. There's a million reasons why he's the best boss ever to me and I think to everyone else that works there. First and foremost, I think that he motivates and inspires everyone around him to share a vision for his company that is all inclusive and that creates an incredible culture where, where everyone can enjoy coming to work. That's the goal, love your job, enjoy coming to work, have everything that you need to accomplish and be successful at your job, but even more than that, to be able to grow, and not just grow within the company, the company is growing and has been growing for years and years, and people have an opportunity to move and grow within the company.

Laura Joudrey:
But it goes beyond that, you can use Extend as a stopping ground. You have other aspirations, you have other goals, you have other things you want, other potential, other things you want to do in your life. And it's just his ability to keep you in a job, but to still pursue your dreams or your desires or whatever, and use us as a stopping ground. And even in that, you get the best that people have to offer because you're a part of their development and what they want. So that's basically the culture. The culture also depends very much on excellent communication. And I would say, first and foremost, also on trust, trusting the people that you work with, trusting that the whole aspect of the company.

Christine Laperriere:
So can I ask you some questions? This is great. I love hearing this. So when you think of Scott, if I was to follow him around for a day, tell me how he makes it, number one, known that it's okay to have a fun to like your job or, how does he inspire that enjoying your job so much? And then I'm also curious, how does he inspire trust?

Laura Joudrey:
He inspires you to like your job because he truly cares and is compassionate in how you do your job and what makes you successful in your job. And he's got open lines of communications and he talks to all the employees. An example would be when we all remotely, it was a huge undertaking. We already had remote staff already. So we'd been there and we knew what that looked like, but it's just a matter of moving 80 to 85 people all into a remote environment and making sure that they are able to continue to work and the business is still up and running. So that was a huge undertaking for the senior leadership team, for Scott, for the employees, for everyone. And after that was all done, Scott made it his mission to contact every single employee, contact every employee and say, how's it going?

Laura Joudrey:
How are you feeling? How's life treating you? How are you feeling emotionally? How's this affecting you? Is your family okay? Do you have the tools you need to work with? How's your job? Are you able to do what you want and do you have any problems? Tell me what your problems are. Is there anything I can do to help? And he contacted every single employee. And so that is an example of how he just leads by example, really, by showing that you care and that it's important.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. That's amazing. So I wondered how long it took him to call.

Laura Joudrey:
It took a while.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, that's got to be incredible amount. Now, was that 80 employees or he called everybody that was also working from home or just the 80 that...

Laura Joudrey:
We have a total staff of around 80 to 84 people and he contacted every person. He touched base with every person. And then as a senior leadership team, we met every single day. We kept in touch with our direct reports as well and we the communication was always there, but it was just that extra. And it does. It takes a lot of time and just sitting back and having the time to even just chat.

Christine Laperriere:
And I mean, we always get into this debate sometimes about, what is the impact to the bottom line? Companies are always asking if we should be putting dollars and cents into our people because what is the impact to the bottom line? If you could describe, what do you think the impact was? Even if it couldn't be measured financially, what do you think the impact of that type of practice does?

Laura Joudrey:
Well, I can tell, like just from the feedback that we got and the impact was wow. This person actually cares, not just about the job, not just about that I didn't miss a beat. I continued to answer because I was sent home at such and such a time and it wasn't even that. It was that he actually cared enough to make sure I was okay, and that everything was going fine for me. That in itself, everything... And I must also say that we have an intranet, like a forum post and he was constantly communicating with employees through the forum post, just to give how quickly things were changing and just to make sure everyone was updated. And those two things made people feel safe and they made them feel connected and they made them feel valued and cared about. And I think that that's invaluable in any way you look at it, not just the loyalty that you create but just the sense of wellbeing and the sense of family or whatever you want to call it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. That feeling that we're going to get through this together.

Laura Joudrey:
Exactly. It was always a together thing. And regardless of what obstacles may come in their path, some of it was crazy times, but we managed just fine and we managed because we had an amazing team behind us that was a coherent team that moved forward. And even with the blips that came through and whatever happened, we were moving forward as a team. And everybody was aware of what was going on. There was full transparency and you just had that feeling that things were going to be okay. Do you know what I mean?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, but if you think about it, if you're having a direct dialogue with the leader of the business, the highest leader of the business and you're able to feel comfortable, that that person sees you and cares about you and is thinking about you while they're trying to navigate this crisis, I would imagine from an employee engagement and rail standpoint, people show up for you. They want to follow you.

Laura Joudrey:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that. Any other things that you observe about Scott's leadership that are particularly different or unique?

Laura Joudrey:
I think his leadership is, and I guess, different... Just prio to working for Extend, I had worked for a lot of small businesses. And I do know, as you say, the bottom line is everything and that's what motivates people. I get the sense with Scott that that's not... Obviously the bottom line matters because you have to have a viable business in order to succeed and be profitable and employ people and do good things for them. But his motivation is to make a better life for everyone. And then that broadens out to the community as well. He's very involved in the community and we do a lot of community work. He personally does a lot of community work and along with the business, we do a lot of community work. He's just always looking for ways to increase the employee experience.

Laura Joudrey:
And in that way, it follows through to the customer experience because when you have a happy employee, who likes their job motivated to do a good job, that all goes down. So as our scores for our customers come in, they've been increasing and so is the employee side as well. And so it's all just this tiered effect that just works. But I think at the very base of the whole thing is a genuine since your desire to improve people's lives. And I really do.

Christine Laperriere:
I get a big smile when you say that because the entire reason, like the inspiration behind this show, Best Boss Ever is that I believe as leaders, we're not just responsible for the bottom line, number one. And I do believe that if I took every leader out there and somehow was able to inspire them to be a better boss, to those that they lead, we would actually improve the happiness and success ratio of everyone.

Laura Joudrey:
That's true. That's true.

Christine Laperriere:
Many of us who have worked for a bad boss know how miserable our lives can be when we're working for a bad boss. And even not a bad boss but even just how a mediocre boss, it's fine. We'll get there. But when you work for a best boss, you just see the energy and the enthusiasm of everyday people. And like you said, it improves the quality of their life.

Laura Joudrey:
It really does. It really does. And I know that even examples, like we have grown over the last few years. We grow partially by acquisition. And when we're in that spot, he'll take the senior leadership and he'll go, "Okay, this is what's on the plate. How do you feel about it? Do you think...?" It's always a dialogue. There's always a dialogue. There's always input. He takes input and suggestions from all areas and then base his decisions that everyone contribute.

Christine Laperriere:
So it sounds like he demonstrates a lot of inclusivity too.

Laura Joudrey:
Absolutely. Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Yeah. Well, I'm just curious too, when you talk about turnover being low, especially in an environment that's typically high turnover, I'm curious, has anybody ever done the math on even what that could be financially to the business? Because if you're training people constantly, you know what I mean? And you're constantly onboarding new faces, that's got to be quite a heavy, heavy load for the business.

Laura Joudrey:
And that's exactly it is. We do a turnover rate every year and we evaluate what the turnover was particularly with new hires. And I know years and years ago, when you're still growing and we had a higher turnover and we're training these people, the cost of training people and evaluating how many are lasting the three months, how many lasting six months or a year, and the cost involved of losing somebody within that space of time. So basically, for each employee, it's a good 15,000, at least in order to get them through their first three months. And that's the training and the time and their time. And then to lose them, it, it costs so much and that's what made the big difference with us.

Laura Joudrey:
It's also analyzing that and understanding the types of people that we want to hire. We were just not hiring the correct people. And when we really delved into that and getting our culture, the kind of culture, the kind of place we wanted to be, the kind of people and family atmosphere we wanted to have, and we started being more discriminating on in the sense of a cultural fit rather than other kinds of fit. And once we started doing that and then really supporting people through the training and that it was all those aspects of it as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So you're hiring more for cultural fit, which has become an improvement in the way that the whole organization functions. And then I'm also hearing, you said even stronger support in those early days when you're transferring them.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes, that's a huge part too is figuring out where the support is, figuring out why people were failing, why they weren't being successful and why they were getting frustrated or whatever the case may be. And then going from that and not even with new hires, but as you go down the road and you're putting on new clients, there's all kinds of differences between clients and the way that you would answer for them and just maintain training all the way through that when you're putting on these more difficult clients and that kind of thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is interesting because when I think back to so many different groups I've worked with, when people leave the organization, they have a tendency to blame it on the person who left.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
But what I'm hearing you say is that we actually sit down and try to figure out why that person wasn't successful. So taking accountability for the fact that maybe you didn't set them up for success in some way and that there's an opportunity there, that's some pretty big insight.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes. And that's exactly the way we look at it, that if we can't build a culture and in an environment that people are excited to come to work, are motivated to come to work, feel like they're valued and appreciated if somebody leaves, or for whatever reason, we want to know why actually we want to know way before they would ever leave to have a dialogue with them and figure it out because the real goal is to create an environment where everybody is happy to come to work, motivated to do what they do to the best of their ability, has an opportunity grow and just loves to come to work every day. We don't want people that don't want to come to work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. Yeah. And what a great way to create the cultural fabric of people who are engaged. And people forget... I always say this culture's so interesting because culture, you can't taste it or touch it, but people mirror each other. So if you have that requirement for highly engaged people, as in you're creating the environment to make sure that they feel that it's a place that they want to be highly engaged, again, that can carry a lot of weight. So just when you're seeing your team members engaged in the job and feeling good, you're so much more likely to emulate that than if everybody around you is slogging.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic. I am really enjoying this. Do you have any other insights that you'd like to share for everybody, especially as leaders are listening to this interview today and they're trying to think of how they can improve their own leadership capability??

Laura Joudrey:
I think for us, we have a great senior leadership team and we all share the same vision. We all share the same goal. And because we have that strategy and everything, I have to say from Scott, it's really a strategy that works from the top down as I think any good strategy does. I mean, you can't have it any other way where it's going to work and be effective. And I think it's something that is so rewarding. It's so, so very rewarding and fulfilling to be able to, I don't want to say, give back, but to be able to help and to make an environment where people feel that they can do a great job, the best job that they can, where they're always supported and supporting each other, and they're just working as a team, as one.

Laura Joudrey:
And it sounds difficult perhaps but I know that every single year, when you do your year end and your financials come out, we sit as a leadership team together and we go, "Oh, okay. Now what can we do this year? What can we add that's going to make it better for everyone? And it's just trying to get that aspect of everything so that we're constantly adding. And not just that, but we're getting feedback from everyone. So we're not arbitrarily adding things that perhaps people don't really even care about. We want to know what you want, what you need, what you feel is lacking, what would make it better or how we can change or any feedback you have whatsoever. That's going to make it a better place to work. And I think it's worked out well because I believe we have an exceptional place to work and a very happy workspace.

Christine Laperriere:
Now I just have to ask you one more question because you caught my attention. But when you were talking about, what do we need to add when you get that feedback from your group, I'm just curious, what things are you adding as a response to that team or what are the types of feedback that you get?

Laura Joudrey:
Usually what we are adding when we're talking about that is we're adding things that we can give back to the employees or things that we can add to the employees. By that, I would mean... So one we implemented a wellness fund. So we said, "Okay, every employee is going to get $300 a year, like some five a quarter. They can get their hair done. They can get their nails done. They can do whatever makes them go to the gym, buy that piece of equipment that they've been wanting to." So we added that one year. Another is we have a great professional development plan. So we support anyone who wants to grow. If they're doing it for professional development, that's going to enhance their job or move them up to another position, we pay for it 100%.

Laura Joudrey:
We also have a personal... So if you're a student going to university, we also have a funding for that. So you can get up to $1,000, we pay 50% of your tuition up to a thousand and books up to $1,000. If you wanted to take a pottery course, we would pay half of that, whatever you feel like, music, lesson, a music court, whatever.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Laura Joudrey:
We will support you in doing that. And other things that we've done is we've enhanced benefit programs. We've enhanced a performance bonus program. Every year, there's something that we try to add that will just enhance the culture, and health, and wellness. This year, we added a mental health program where people can access mental health providers get support. They can do an assessment. There's all kinds of mental health because that's been a huge thing as well with the remote work and the pandemic and every else. So those are the examples that-

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. Okay. So I have really enjoyed this interview. What I love hearing too, even those examples, those are real investments. I hear so many companies, they want to improve the workplace, but at no cost. So I get a lot of calls where people say, we're trying to make all these big improvements, but we don't want to spend a dime. So we're trying to do it off the side of our desk but I always say, it shows that there's not a prioritization of it. If we wouldn't put any investment to it but what I'm hearing here, I mean, every example you've stated, these are real investments. They're not just talk.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes, that's right. This was so much fun for me, especially because I have an absolute love and passion for hearing about what the best boss ever do. And I love to hear how companies are creating these really one of a kind workplace that people aspire to stay at and be happy. So thank you. This was very informative and I hope that this was great for our listeners as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank You, Laura.

Laura Joudrey:
Well, thank you very much for having me, Christine.
