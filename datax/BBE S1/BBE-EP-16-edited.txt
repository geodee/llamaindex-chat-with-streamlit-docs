Guest: Jaime Moody

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the boss that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So, welcome, Jamie. Thank you so much for being on the show.

Jaime Moody:
Oh, it's great to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm so thrilled that you are on this show. When I think of really great guests to bring on, I love to go back and reflect on leaders that I've known throughout my career, and we got a chance to know each other through CEO Global as you were CEO of Tree of Life, and what I really admired was how many people respected and admired you. So, out of that group of a hundred CEOs and leaders, you were definitely one of the most admired leaders in that group. And so, for me, when I ask the question who's your best boss ever, I feel like I go after the ones who are already admired by their peers in that way.

Jaime Moody:
It's nice of you to say. Thank you.

Christine Laperriere:
Do you want to do any other introduction just to get us started?

Jaime Moody:
Tree of Life has been my passion for these last 23 years, having been the president for about 18 of those years and now as vice chair, I'm just on the board and an advisor to the business, and having just hired a new president to take over and working with her. Her name is Lisa MacNeil and she is doing fabulous. Love having her on the team.

Christine Laperriere:
I love it. That is excellent. So, then just diving in, I want to know who is your best boss ever, and why?

Jaime Moody:
I really come up with a lot of folks over the years, quite frankly, but there's two that really stand out, and it's been my most recent experience of these folks that I work with and for very different reasons. One was when I first came into this company and I just had someone I worked with and I came in sort of as a second in command, if you will, CFO, and the person I work with at the time had hired me. He just had an all-around knowledge of the business and was just so knowledgeable in just every facet of the business, and I just like the fact that you could take any sort of issue to him and have a discussion about it, and he would weigh in and not tell you what to do, of course, but he would weigh in and give you some things to think about. He very much let me do what I did and stayed out of my way.

Jaime Moody:
That's been mostly true in my career as I worked for people sort of let me do what I do and pretty much stayed out of my way or else I wouldn't have stayed, right, because that is the old adage, right? You don't quit a company. You quit the boss. That's almost always true, but you really just quit people who don't let you do what you do. And so, I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of people who let me do what I do. It's been fun.

Christine Laperriere:
So, when you think of that first boss that you had though, who it sounds like he was a mentor probably in some ways or his style was very mentoring, what happens if you were on the wrong track or if you were headed down the wrong path. How did he help bring you back?

Jaime Moody:
Frankly, he was just very direct, right? He just said, "We're off course here and we just need to get it back on course." Ultimately, there wasn't a lot of that, to be honest, in this particular situation. It just seemed to be a business that fit well with me and I fit well there and we were just able to achieve some good things, but that's the point. That's what mentorship's about is helping you setting out guidelines. I've always been a strong believer in setting goals and have alignment against goals and then being very pragmatic about how we cascade those goals within the organization and making sure there's no room for error or misjudgment. So, there's a lot of communication that has to go out along that way, and so he was good at that. We knew what we needed to accomplish together and what we needed to accomplish individually. So, it made for a good, healthy environment.

Christine Laperriere:
Did you find that you also got autonomy on how you worked and when you worked and some of those things once you had really good alignment on the outcome?

Jaime Moody:
Almost always had that, and that's a great part too. I've almost always had. I guess it's a part of I get to work when I want. Well, I worked a lot, so I guess that's when I wanted to. When you fill the day with work, and I always remember those feelings, when you're driving home from the office and it might be eight o'clock at night and you reflect back on what you've accomplished in the day, you feel good about it. I always good about that. I felt like I got a lot done and I would go back in the next day energized. So, that was a good thing.

Christine Laperriere:
And then who was that second boss that crossed your mind?

Jaime Moody:
Well, and that is the boss that worked [inaudible 00:04:31. Now, this gentleman runs an organization that has many billions of dollars. He's based in the US. 5,000 employees, et cetera, something like that. What really struck me was when they come in and bought our business and they bought it many, many years ago now, I remember having the first conversation with him just before they closed on the transaction. He came up to Toronto and we got together. He and the CFO of the organization came up. We met for dinner and drinks first, and as would be my norm, I start talking about the business, my love, my passion, and he said, "Well," he said, "I know about the business or at least I know enough today about the business. What I don't know is who you are, and what I really want to know is get to know you as a person."

Jaime Moody:
And that has always stayed with me since that day, right? It is about let's know each other as individuals. Let's know each other as people first, and then honor and respect everything that we are as people. The business is a part of who we are and what we do, of course, but first it's about who we are as people. What a delightful conversation it was.

Christine Laperriere:
Such a great point. So, as he's gotten to know you as a person, how does that shape how he works with you?

Jaime Moody:
I would have him come up to our annual sales and marketing meetings, and we give him a half an hour to talk to folks that people always want to know how it's going in the mothership and how the US is doing, and at the end of his address, he would always turn to me and he would say, "And Jamie, keep writing those checks." Right? Not that we ever sent them a check, but the reality is we were doing good things to the organization and the business was successful, and that's the way he just wanted to close his discussion with a little humor, obvious appreciation for what we do as an organization.

Jaime Moody:
Frankly, in the end, for the most part, I was not reporting to him, I was reporting to the CFO because when they bought the business, they really bought the business of our US parent company, and Canada was not an afterthought, but a throw in, was not strategic to their intent. But six months after the deal, he had me come down and speak to the board of directors and talk to the board about who we are and what we are and what our future prospects are. At that point, we were no longer for sale. As he said to me, he said, "Now that we've fallen in love with your business and we understand it better, and maybe you should report to me." And I said, "No, no. I like reporting to the CFO. He's a great guy. We're both learning from each other. He wants to do deals. I want to do deals." And so, we stayed that way. Since then, this fellow and I have become very close friends. We've done many vacations together. When we're away in vacation, we almost never talk business, but we know each other as people for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. It's such a good example though. Sometimes when I'm working with leaders, like you said, they jump to the business conversation first. We always want to be really efficient and really purposeful about time. I find that by nature we always jump in and talk shop right away, and I think it's interesting that he slowed you down and he prioritized getting to know you, almost with the assumption that if he got to know you, he'd be able to do business with you better.

Jaime Moody:
Absolutely. Absolutely right. And so, I've really tried to learn from that. I'm not good at it all the time. I sometimes get it right, but I always in the end find out more about people. This is not just some person who just shows up at your office every day. These are people who spend most of their waking hours with you, and so that's why I've always looked at that and said, "Let's build a family culture in the organization so that it becomes a fun place to come to." I've always enjoyed when I hear laughing in the outside or in the office or wherever, and I will sometimes in my management, my walking around, wander in to a group that's having some fun and I will have a laugh with them and just look at them and say, "Okay, permission to have fun."

Christine Laperriere:
Permission to have fun. This is kind of a nice segue. I'm curious, tell me a little bit more about the culture you created because I think people listening are going, "Oh, family culture? We're allowed to have fun?" Tell me more about that.

Jaime Moody:
It's really about purpose. We set out some years ago, maybe 11, 12 years ago, to create our own culture if you will, create a culture that was purposeful to what we could be or should be as opposed to that which just simply exists. So, we wanted to be a little bit of our own design, and I really wanted to be a values-based, performance-based culture. I think we had that, but they weren't well enunciated, and we have a quarterly meeting though, where we talk to all of our new folks. I used to fly across the country to do this with all our places across the country, but now it's easier because we do it virtually. But every quarter, we would sit and talk to everybody who's joined the organization last quarter and I would explain where the values came from.

Jaime Moody:
So, our purpose at Tree of Life is helping Canada eat well and live well, and it's a purpose that allows us to say what we do in terms of bringing great foods to Canadians. People are engaged by the culture. They understand it but that's not enough. I wanted to be values-based as well. So, we did an exercise. It's from Jim Collins back when he was, 1996, he wrote an article in Harvard Business Review how to bring values and purpose into your culture, and in there he described something called the mission of Mars.

Jaime Moody:
And the mission of Mars is something where you bring your people together and say, "Okay, here's the deal. I want you to think about this. We're going to have some people from Tree of Life go to Mars, and I want you to select who's going to go. Now, understand that it's not about that they speak Martian or that Martians speak English. We're just going to get to know each other through our observation and look at how we interact, right, and that we're just going to learn from each other. So, who do you want to send on that trip?" Pretty simple concept, right? And I said, "Bring three names."

Jaime Moody:
So, at the end, our management team got together. We had a two-day off-site. I think there was over 51 names on the board, but there was five names on the board that came up again and again. The discussion then turned. Well, let's brainstorm. Let's do some word mapping around why you picked these people, right, why these people were picked and what it is about them.

Jaime Moody:
And so, out of that came our values and our values are courage, accountability, improvement, balance, and excellence. They've been with us a long time, but that's what came out. We were able to put descriptors around what those words were. One day, our CEO said to me, he said, "Jamie, why is it that your values in Canada are different from those in the US?" And I said, "Well, because ours are made in Canada and they're from us. They're people. Right? They reflect who we are." He said, "Oh," because he thought maybe that our values should be the same as theirs, and I said, "Yeah." But he respects the fact that Canada is a distinct culture from the US, and he asked me how we process we did. So, they did the same thing in the US. They took a mission to Mars.

Christine Laperriere:
Did they come up with any similar values or were they completely unique?

Jaime Moody:
No, they're very similar. Quite frankly, our parent company is faith founded. Their purpose is serving and honoring God in everything we do. It's really about the golden rule of how we treat people. That's the commonality, if you will, as I interpret it. They have similar values around being humble, respectful, integrity. We tithe 10% of our earnings to help the less fortunate. So, that's how we honor our values. But people really get engaged I think by the fact that we have values. They really do drive what we do every day as a business, and our purpose certainly does that. Having a boss who allows you to do that is a very good thing. Bringing people along for the ride, when you do that is very engaging.

Christine Laperriere:
It's so interesting, and then I'm curious. So, when you see somebody in the organization that is not aligned to those values, help me understand what is it like to work in a very values-based organization, especially if somebody doesn't quite fit that mold.

Jaime Moody:
You have to make them real. Strategy is simple. Execution is difficult, right? This is just our strategy. We wanted to be purpose-driven and we wanted to be values-based. So, the execution of that is something that just means you got to live in every day. So, if you've got people that are offside, you bring them to the game. I always take the opposite view of things. There's an old adage in business, HR philosophy from years and years ago that you should treat everybody the same. I've never believed that. I think you should treat everybody great. And great to you and great to me are likely going to be two different things, right? So, people interpret these things differently, but what we tried to do is we've created awards, call them the LOV Awards, living our values. Every month we talk about people who are living our values. Every month we would talk about is there a situation that's risen in the last period that you've heard we are not living our values, and those are fruitful discussions. They don't come up often, but when they do, they're great discussions.

Christine Laperriere:
When are things in conflict with those values most often? I'm just curious. When do you notice there's actually sometimes a conflict with the values?

Jaime Moody:
Not very often do you think that you find things that are in conflict with the values. I've never believed in mission statements. I think they're worthless. They're usually just words that say, "We're going to be the best." Well, that doesn't tell you how you're going to be the best. I've always loved these statements that FedEx has, for example, is 9:00 AM next day guaranteed. Right? Simple. Everybody understands what it is. Everybody's job is that. Right?

Jaime Moody:
Helping Canada eat well and live well is our purpose statement. I put a goal statement to that, and I call them Jamie's forever goals, likely because we'll never get there, but we should forever be pursuing them. And I always make a joke about that, they're forever goals because just for that reason, but they are that we want this to be the best place to work, and we want every customer and client experience to be a great experience. It just rolls out off the tongue, and that comes back to me all the time when I was running the business. But if we're going to make this the best place to work, then what about this? If we're going to make that a great client experience or a customer experience, what about this?

Christine Laperriere:
That resonates with me. Right off the bat, I'm thinking to myself how much that would shape the way you make decisions every day. Those tiny, little micro-decisions, you can always bounce it off of a forever goal.

Jaime Moody:
The hardest value that we have is called work-life balance. My definition of work-life balance is understandably different from someone else's, and as people deal with that, they say, "You're not living up to your balance statement. You're not living to that value." Right? And I said, "You're right." It's the hardest thing to deal with, as I say. It's different for everybody. But just think about it this way. If that wasn't one of our values, how bad do you think it would be? It makes us think about it. It's driven our benefit plans. It's driven some of the flexibility we have around our work schedule. It's driven the fact that we are a family. We get that, and if there's a sick child at home, please deal with it.

Christine Laperriere:
I've actually coined the phrase work-life wisdom because I call it, it's custom for each one of us. So, my wisdom is exiting at 5:30 so I can spend quality time with my three and five-year-old. But your wisdom may be different. You know what I mean? You might choose to have dinner at seven o'clock at night, or make sure that you get time with the cats. It can be a very different version of what your wisdom is that tells you what you need to stay resilient.

Jaime Moody:
That's exactly right and that's precisely the point. If you want people to be engaged in what you do every day, you have to treat them as humans. You have to give them some flexibility, right? You have to treat them in the way you'd like to be treated.

Christine Laperriere:
It is amazing how these all sound so simple, but in reality, for some reason, they're not. I'm talking to a leader today whose boss wants her in the office at 7:00 AM working on something that he believes is time sensitive, and it's just so interesting when I think of how many leaders have lost sight of that, that it sounds obvious, but it's not.

Jaime Moody:
Yeah, and the way I've always dealt with that is to think about there's always things you need to get done. You have to have a performance culture. One of the best ways to drive performance is by putting milestones and deadlines in place. The times when you are the most productive ever is the week before vacation, or when you have a deadline. Just sometimes I would put artificial deadlines in place. Yes, I want to get things done, and I would always ask a person, "When do you think you can have that done by?" I may be thinking three weeks is great. They are almost inevitably going to say something less than three weeks, and we end up something in between probably. So, allowing people to set their own deadlines, which is what my bosses have done for me, right, has been a great learning experience for me. It will get done. It will get done in that timeframe, and it will get done right.

Christine Laperriere:
So, tell me about your worst boss.

Jaime Moody:
I haven't had a lot of them, for one, but I guess I should call it the guy who fired me as my worst boss. I was working for a company that, well, it was one of those companies when you walk in, it was too good to be true. When I looked at the financial statements, all it was good, but when I actually got inside the doors, I saw that they were basically insolvent. The good news is we figured out a way to get us out of that situation, and I was a big part of why that got figured out, I would say. But one, day he came into my office and he fired me on the spot and he didn't tell me why, and I had really no idea why. I found out later that some people had positioned me as that I should be taking over the business, and it was his private business. I mean, it was never even in the scope of my mind that I would do that.

Jaime Moody:
So, in the end, it wasn't a great experience, but through the process, spent about two years there. We took a business that was basically insolvent and turned it around and got it fixed and put it in a good place. And if there's ever a way that for young people, as they're starting in their career and they're in a crisis situation learning how to sail a ship when the ship is on fire is a great experience. It's not fun while you're there, but it's a great learning experience, and it is the baptism on fire.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is an excellent piece of wisdom right there too. I think of different situations that I've been in where it's extremely challenging. To your point, they're the biggest education.

Jaime Moody:
Anybody can sell a ship in smooth seas as they often say.

Christine Laperriere:
So, knowing that this show gets a lot of listens from people who are entering into leadership, are currently in leadership and/or ones who are trying to be better leaders, just share with me kind of... I think you probably have hours of words of wisdom, but as many things as you can that they need to hear right now.

Jaime Moody:
Well, the best leaders I've worked for there has been a common bound and that's been that they love to learn, and they want you to learn. As you think about your career, as we talked a little bit earlier about being purposeful about your career, part of being purposeful is making sure that you're learning everything you can along the way, right? That's going to prepare you for your next role, whether it's in the current organization or whether it's outside the current organization, but as long as you're learning every piece, then you're in a good place.

Jaime Moody:
And look for a boss who is a lifelong learner, and that's how you're going to be able to lead people and have a successful career, by learning as much as you can along the way. Being part of the CEO Global network as you and I were, it's just a hot bed for learning. It's what we do, right? We help each other, and with problems that we have that are often a similar but different problem that we have each other, the perspectives you get from being able to talk to other people about it and the learning you get from that is just fantastic.

Jaime Moody:
So, that is the other thing for a young leader. Get a mentor. Get somebody you can speak to and maybe in the same organization, but perhaps not. I've done some mentoring of some people from other organizations, and I've learned a lot from them as well. I love mentoring a younger person because how much do I learn from a younger person, right? It's fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
Keeps your mindset valuable and flexible too, right?

Jaime Moody:
Precisely. The thoughts of a younger consumer are quite a bit different from where I'm thinking, not to mention the challenges we have around technology and how much fun we have with that. I quite enjoy technology and bound and determine not to be a dinosaur because I love this stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
But I bet that mentoring of youth, again, you have so much wisdom to share. They're keeping you young and thinking about different age groups and the way different brains operate. So, that's kind of a win-win for everybody.

Jaime Moody:
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, Jamie, thank you so much. Like I said, I'd love to pick your brain for hours. Maybe we'll have to have you on again. So, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Jaime Moody:
Been great, Christine. Very nice talking to you.
