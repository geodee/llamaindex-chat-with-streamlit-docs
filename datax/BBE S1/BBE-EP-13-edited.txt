Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Mike Lindstrom

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me ar christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. All right, well, welcome to the show. Today, we have Mike Lindstrom with us and I am very excited to have you on the show.

Mike Lindstrom:
I'm excited to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
And the reason that I brought Mike on the show, this is really actually quite special for me is that Mike was my first coach. So back in 2003, 2004, I got the opportunity to work with Mike as he coached me through really taking a deep dive into what I was doing, because I was a vehicle engineer at the time. And him really trying to help me understand who I was authentically and what kind of career I really wanted to lead. So I think it's pretty incredible. I thought he had the coolest job on the planet, at the time. So it is pretty incredible that today I'm a coach as well and kind of followed in your footsteps, but you were definitely part of the inspiration that led me down the path. So I am thrilled to have you on today, Mike.

Mike Lindstrom:
The best part is when student becomes colleague, at some point or vice versa, that's even better.

Christine Laperriere:
Why don't you share a little bit of your background?

Mike Lindstrom:
I mean, it's so funny because people anymore, they go on Google or YouTube or Wikipedia and they see all this stuff. "Oh he is a writer. He worked for Robbins', he's speaker and all that stuff." So I try to make it real simple. So I did go to law school, but I'm not a practicing attorney. So literally the month after I graduated from law school, the gentleman I'm going to probably talk about today. His name is Dan Lier was working for Tony Robbins, the motivational speaker, who I didn't know from anybody at the time hired me basically out of school to become a speaker and a coach working for Robbins for two years.

Mike Lindstrom:
We did speaking events on the road. And then in 2000, 2001, we started coaching company in La Jolla, California. It was called Robbin's Results Partnership. And we worked predominantly with entrepreneurs, salespeople making over a quarter million dollars, professional athletes and celebrities. So I helped Tony build the business and I told him it was time for me to spread my wings. I started my own coaching practice, not in direct conflict. He gave me his blessing and said, "Good luck and represent our brand well." And I never looked back, so here I am.

Christine Laperriere:
So, with that, then tell us more about this best boss ever? That's always the question.

Mike Lindstrom:
Yeah. So Dan Lier it's L-I-E-R, if you want to pull him up, Dan's in our industry, he's a speaker. He's actually the top speaker in Las Vegas. I mean, during COVID obviously was much difficult, right? And no assembly, no getting together live, so that hurt his business a little bit. But imagine you live right outside of Las Vegas, but you can do two or three keynotes a day, drive down to the Strip, work with some major corporation, get paid a ton of money, talk for an hour and go home, right? So he's got a pretty sweet gig, nowadays.

Mike Lindstrom:
But with Dan, I didn't know from anybody, he was a mutual friend that introduced us because my buddy had just joined the team at Robbins. He was from San Diego. He said, "You got to get in touch with this guy. Dan, I'm telling you, they're looking for more people. They want energetic people. People that are educated. They're going to really represent Tony's brand in the North American territory."

Mike Lindstrom:
Now, when I heard that word North American territory, I'm thinking, "Wow, this sounds like a travel job, right?" Sure enough, it was. We lived in five cities per year. So my first city was Atlanta, Georgia. Then in Philadelphia, San Francisco, LA, Chicago, New York, it was awesome. We'd live there for six to eight weeks. And we would basically promote the Robbins brand, but we'd also sell a one day event. It was called, The Competitive Edge at the time. Now it's Bunked. It's a different program.

Mike Lindstrom:
So Dan was literally the guy who hired me to join the traveling team. So, you imagine you have 12 people and this guy, Dan and his wife, Tammy at the time, traveling all over the country. So he was my boss day in, day out. We lived in the same community. We'd see each other on the weekends at the pool because we had corporate housing. We'd see each other at happy hours on Friday. So not just like a boss, you would go see at an office place. You're on the road living literally with this individual. So he literally took me under his wing. He's 10 years older than me exactly. So we just had so many things. He said, "You're me 10 years ago, man. I see myself in you. So I want to make sure you don't stumble the way I did." So, he took my success and failure very personally. I was lucky to have him as really my first real boss I would call him. And Tony was his boss. So I'm one degree removed from Tony Robbins himself.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell me a little bit about when let's say the team had a mess up or they were doing something? Again, you're living with the person too, so that's not easy, but give me an example of how would Dan respond?

Mike Lindstrom:
And that was the other part about having him literally with us on the road, he would go out to meetings with us. So we had a script we had to follow to a T. I mean, Tony was really big on framing, context is what we call it syntax, the order in which you present information. We had to record ourselves, send videos in. Back in the day it was tapes, right, to Tony. He would review them and then give you feedback. But Dan would go out to live meetings with you. And I'll never forget this. My first cycle. That's what we call the city cycle, was Atlanta. And I'm fresh out of law school. I was actually the most "educated" person on the team. I was a little cocky, single guy, just kind of thinking I had this swagger.

Mike Lindstrom:
I was actually competitive. In law school we would do a mock trial. So I was used to being in front of a judge, a jury, speaking, presenting came very naturally for me. So to have Dan come out and ride with you, your boss come out and sit in the meeting and I would never forget this. It was a real estate company and he recorded it and we were in the car and he asked me a question and now I know this famous question. He says, "Mike, let me ask you a question. He goes zero to 10. 10 is the best presentation you've ever done for us. Zero is the worst ever. What would you rate yourself?" And I'm thinking, "Okay, loaded question. How do I answer this? No such thing as a 10, because you can always improve, right?"

Mike Lindstrom:
And I said, "I'd say an eight, I'd say an eight." And he just goes, "Wow. Wow." Never forget that. He said, "Two wows." Which I didn't know what that meant at the time. He said, "I would've gave you like a two." So we got a problem because you think you're an eight and that's a two. So we got a lot of work to do. So this weekend, I better not see you out at the pool. I better not see you at happy hour in the neighborhood. I better not see you out with the team. I want you to nail that script. If I knock on your door at eight o'clock Saturday night, okay. I want to see those big post-it notes all around your condo. And hoping you have walked and pasted that whole thing, 100s of times to nail the script because you don't have it nailed."

Mike Lindstrom:
Now that was my biggest first lesson is, "Holy crap. I'm not prepared. There's always another level." I mean, there's so much coaching going on in this moment, right? I didn't leave my apartment all weekend. I studied that script. I literally pasted that. I had the post-it notes of every chunk as we called it. And I did my meeting on Monday, did much better obviously, but he came out and rode with me a month later and he told me he was proud of me, which I appreciate. Having your boss and coach tell you, he is proud of you. But he said, "You still got work to do, buddy. You're the newest guy on the team and you still don't have it. There's tonality shifts. There's body language. There's certain anchors that have to go into that script that you don't have nailed." So I was kind of the first lesson of the worst case scenario for my own self. But I never saw like the veterans majorly screw up. I just saw myself screw up and I know how hard he was on me because you had to over prepare.

Christine Laperriere:
I love this story. This is such a great story, especially given that I work with so many sales teams, right? And we go through this, going on the road and people thinking they nailed it. And meanwhile, from a third party observer it's not close. Now, why did that not demotivate you? A lot of people listening would be saying, "Oh God, that's not my best boss. That's my worst boss."

Mike Lindstrom:
Right. Well, in the interview for process, Dan knew my background. I was an athlete growing up. So I played baseball, basketball, football. He asked me those kind of questions in the interviewing process. "Tell me about your background? Were you a competitor? Were you an athlete in any way?" So he knew I had that athletic kind of mentality, football mentality being in the locker room. He was a two time national champion basketball player at Fort Hays State. So, I knew he was an athlete and he understood that coaching element. Beat them up a little bit. Let them think they're good, but not really. And then, pick them up and you build them up.

Mike Lindstrom:
So we kind of knew that about each other. So I noticed he didn't do that with my friend, Tiffany, next person to come in right after me. She was the next rookie. Tiffany came in and I remember he tried that approach with her the first month and it did not work. She came home to the apartment, crying in tears. "What did I do? Why did I leave my job to come out here and live with all you guys? I don't even know you guys." I said, "Look, I went through this, Tiffany. I'm going to help you out. I promise. We're going to keep you in and study your script." So, as you know, as a coach, you have to know how to tap into that person's motivation. Some people love the tough love and some people don't. I mean, we learned quickly that that didn't work for Tiffany, but that worked for Mike Lindstrom, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
So he changed his style for Tiffany, so she stayed on the team then?

Mike Lindstrom:
Yeah. She stayed on the team. In fact, she moved up to kind of like the next level team and really kicked butt. Dan was very adroit at kind of knowing what he was dealing with, with each individual, male, female, older, younger. Some of the guys on the team. If you remember, I was 25, 26 years old, right out of law school. We had had team members in their mid 30s closer to Dan's age. So he could kind of talk to them different. He was also a father. I wasn't, I was a single guy. So he would always kind of play the right angle. But he was very good at kind of knowing what he was dealing with.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And to me, that is definitely a quality of a best boss ever, who knows how to say, "Everybody on the team is important, but I am going to shift my style to build up everybody." But what I'm really hearing too, is that he took your performance or your capability and really did unleash it and built you up to a varsity player from a junior varsity, right? Or maybe a little leagues. You walked in the door and thought you were in the game but he was like, "No, no, no, you got a lot longer to go."

Mike Lindstrom:
Well, you know, what's funny? I mean, I'm not private about this. I'm very public about it, but I don't get asked these kind of questions about bosses and mentors. So this topic is near and dear to me. So I had a coach named Robert Alderman. Robert is a famous coach. He passed away, God bless, a couple years ago, lived about late, late 70s. He was literally Tony Robbin's coach, not mentor, Jim Rohn. Jim was his mentor, brought him up in the business. So he kind considered him as a mentor. He brought in Robert to coach him on understanding behavior, understanding the DISC, like a technical perspective.

Mike Lindstrom:
So once Robert and Tony became really close, Tony required Robert to coach all the leaders in the firm. So I got promoted to basically run that coaching company. Robert became my coach. So I had Dan Lier and Tony over here, within the company, my bosses. And then I had this coach outside of the organization that Tony said that, "You're going to learn a lot from this guy." And I remember the coaching being very different styles, but they were all saying the same thing. They're like, "Mike, your stint here at the Robbins Organization will be short because you're an entrepreneur, you're a high dominant person. You're a high influencer, low steady, low compliant. This is classic high D high I. You're going to learn and go. I mean, the fact that you've been here, as long as you have, we're surprised."

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Mike Lindstrom:
But that's important to know as a coach that you're dealing with someone and this is a story you and I had. When I saw your DISC profile and you're an engineer, it just didn't add up. I'm like, "Why is she doing this, when her profile tells me she should be doing this?" So, it's having that ability to adapt the styles based off that person's own style.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. That's fantastic. So we picked your brain on best boss. Now you've had a chance to work with lots of different leaders. I'm kind of curious, what are the trends you see in great leaders? Not just the vague piece, but give us the stories, give us the meat and give me the examples of those leaders where you really do see them break away from the rest?

Mike Lindstrom:
So you're right. I got caught up in after the Robbins days, I was a dotcom kid too. So I got lucky to find that whole wave same time, '99, 2000, 2001. So watching that startup mentality, believing in this brand, we're going to take it public. And everyone's drinking the Kool-Aid like I went through all of that. It was awesome. It was great success. Great failure. I mean, I made an amazing network of people. So I've been in and out of starterups over the years. Even in the cannabis industry, for example, someone would say, "Hey, you may or may not be involved with what the product is, but we need to build a company. Can we have you come in and help us because we like to replicate Fortune 500 companies in the industry, because it's never been done before?"

Mike Lindstrom:
To me, that's exciting because you're going to take a leader who started something. I don't care if it's a piece of technology or in the cannabis space, you're going to find a quality about the leader that they're trying to replicate. That's how you build a culture. The base word of culture is cult, common language, common belief, common direction. The problem is we think of Jim Jones in Ghana and 800 people drinking Kool-Aid that's what we think of when hear the word cult. Like Apple, Google, these companies are so cultish, Netflix, because they got everybody from the top down drinking the Kool-Aid. But they understand from at the top what they're stirring.

Mike Lindstrom:
There was a method and that's what I've learned over the years, watching great companies go from good to great. Jim Collins talks about in his book is that the great leaders are very methodical about what they're putting in the Kool-Aid. It's not accidental. They are being successful because they're driving home a certain thing during that meeting. They have core values that are literally published on the wall. Every single individual, like at Lululemon, they know purpose and why period. I don't care if you're answering the phones or you're an executive purpose and why is a big part of Lululemon's culture. So, that starts at the top, speed of leader, speed of pack.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is such a perfect example because I talk about that all the time. Like culture, I work with so many leaders and I'm always talking about how people mirror one another, they just do. We are humans and our brains are built to mirror one another. And you can watch us either subconsciously in a room when one person crosses their legs, you'll watch three more people cross their legs or one person yells at their employee and you watch three more people think that, that's what leadership is. They go to their next meeting and they yell at the next person. And so it is just phenomenal how you've explained culture and being intentional with it because I feel like I'm always trying to tell that story. I love the idea too, of the use of the word cult. You're right. It's got a negative pejorative to it. I guess it's not one that we use often, but it is what culture really is what it is, right?

Mike Lindstrom:
So Dave Liniger is the founder of Remax, the real estate company. And he's really progressive about training. And I've done training with those guys for a long, long time and Dave and I are friends. He lives in Colorado and he's got international franchise sales territories. So it was a couple years ago we had me come in as a keynote and a trainer. And we actually did some of the old school stuff. We did the board breaking and stuff that some people kind of see maybe as cheesy in the modern day. Tony Robbins still does a fire walk gimmicky or not, people are going to go do it.

Mike Lindstrom:
So I took a little couple just creative liberties. I said, "Do you guys know what a cult is?" Did the whole bit in front of the room. And I said, "You know, you guys are a cult?" Dave's in there, back in the room, laughing. They all stood up and clapped for themselves. They were so proud that they were being called a cult, the red, white, and blue balloon, whether it's recognized brands in the real estate industry in the whole wide world. They're proud of that. But you go talk to Dave Liniger and his wife that started that company in the early 70s when they flipped the real estate model on its head and said, "Why are we taking your commissions? You work so hard. Why don't we just take a fee, give you a 100% of your commission and let you be, build your own brand? Just go fly the balloon. We'll help you do it." Genius in 1972 or whatever it was. So to have him, tell you that he's very proud of that. It's because he knows the method. He knows what he is stirring.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that. I know some people are going to be smiling while they're thinking about that. Because you're right. We all know Remax. That's not a hard name to identify with. What an incredible brand. So any last kind of words of wisdom when you're thinking about all the people out are listening are in cultures where they're either high performers or they're on their way to leadership. And I'm really hoping that this show helps inform them about how they think about leading. I'd really like people to think, not just about being a good enough manager, but truly trying to be a best boss ever and really influence people's lives for the better. What are your words of wisdom for them?

Mike Lindstrom:
So the one thing that I've become more and more just congruent with probably the last five years, I mean COVID really helped me bring it home even further is when somebody hears the word brand, they think of a company, right? Apple, Google, Remax, et cetera. In sports, you have the logo on the front. That's the team, the logo that everyone recognizes, whether it's the Dallas Cowboys or New York Yankees, all these big brands in the world. But the name on the back of the Jersey, that's you as the individual. Being really mindful of your personal brand. Personal brand. You're not getting out from underneath the company brand and it's not selfish and it's not egotistical.

Mike Lindstrom:
You have to be mindful of your personal brand. How do people talk about you behind your back? If I interviewed three to five people in your company and said, "Hey, tell me about this individual. What's great about them and what's not great about them? Are you aware of that? Do you even know your own profile? Have you ever done the DISC profile or Drake or Dots?" And there's a million of them out there. You go learn all of that. Get coaching. I mean, that's why you do what we do. Watching that person really truly look introspectively and say, "I need to work on myself to be better within a bigger brand called the company." So I think that's something that gets lost.

Mike Lindstrom:
And I hate to say this and I won't name company names, but there are certain companies out there. They don't want that. They don't want you building your personal brand. They want you to be a worker bee. You show up at eight, get your one hour break at noon and you're off at five and we pay you the same money every two weeks. We don't want you to grow. We don't want to disrupt the apple cart. But that's a problem. Those companies will never have that big culture that you and I talked about.

Mike Lindstrom:
The Dave Linigers of the world, they would never go work for that company because they promote branding at the individual level. So if you want to really take a good, hard look in the mirror about the company that you want to work with, you want to look at, "Can I grow in this company? Do they invest in me? Are they going to give me grief that I'm going to go take three days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and need a day off without having to do PTO because I want to go to a seminar to be a better negotiator?" I mean, that's where you start to see, do they really believe in you? And I think that personal branding thing is so big and it gets lost for some reason in training.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that you're saying that. I'm grinning because I teach personal branding as a huge portion of a lot of the leadership programs that I work on. It forces you to reflect too. And it forces you to get authentic about what you're really trying to be as far as a leader. So if you go back to that idea of best boss ever, it makes sense that that person would be waking up knowing that they want to be a best boss ever. That was part of their personal brand. It was part of the intention that they were bringing.

Mike Lindstrom:
So I have one exercise. I'll give this to you. I don't remember if you and I did this, obviously I'm a journal guy. What's written is real. And I've been carrying this everywhere I go. And it's not a diary, people. It's a journal. It's a capture mechanism. It's a thought, it's a quote. It's a movie. So I don't sit there every night going, "Dear Mike. Oh, today was kind of a weird day." That's a diary. This is a journal. Journaling is something that you just have close to you when you have random thoughts. So here's a journal exercise. It's great prompt. Always date your pages. Date the page so you can always remember. And you ask this one question. I am at my best when..... And you fill up a whole journal page in bullet points.

Mike Lindstrom:
Now I know my journals have 28 lines. I've got six by nine. There's, 28 lines on this journal. That's at least 28 I have to answer every single line, 28 times. I am at my best when I wake up early. I am my best when I work out. I am at my best when I have private, authentic, real time with my kids every night before they go to bed. Whatever. I'm just rattling stuff off. But you got to create that best version of yourself because no one's going to do it for you. This manual, wasn't gifted to you in college or law school for me. I had to go find people like Dan Lier and Tony Robbins and Robert Alderman to force me to do these kind of things. So I looked in the mirror and said, "I am at my best When." And I know what that is. And I know when I'm not there. If I'm incongruent in any way, it's stressful. You know, when you're not at your best, you know this?

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.

Mike Lindstrom:
But, oh, I'm off to today. I've done it on stages. I've done it on coaching calls, but you have to have a blueprint of, "You at your best when," and really go in depth with that and be brutally honest with that.

Christine Laperriere:
Ah, what a fantastic prompt. I'm laughing because I actually use that as part of the personal branding exercises, such a simple way to tap into what your values are, what energizes you, what works for you. And I think that's a great call to action for people who are listening today.

Mike Lindstrom:
Love it.

Christine Laperriere:
Mike, this was fantastic. I really appreciate your time. Is there a simple way anybody, if they're listening right now, I'm sure they're going to be pretty fired up, how do they stalk you on social media?

Mike Lindstrom:
So I'm on all social. I mean, what I've been gravitating to more and more lately is LinkedIn. So I love connecting with people on LinkedIn. I've never turned down a request on LinkedIn. LinkedIn does a good job of policing its community. Facebook, I might not say that there's people I might accept or not. I'm kind of private about my personal stuff on Facebook, but in LinkedIn for sure. Mike Lindstrom, JD. That's my law degree. If you Google it, you can see the baldheaded guy. But my website is mikelindstrom.com There's a D in there. L-I-N-D-S-T-R-O-M. I'm in the process of redoing it by the way. So it may be up or down or not where I want it to be right now, but it's always going to be live. And all my social media links are on there. I have a YouTube channel that's attached to the website. So, that's easiest way. Just go to mikelindstrom.com or hit me on LinkedIn.

Christine Laperriere:
Lovely. Thank you so much. This was awesome. Thanks so much.

Mike Lindstrom:
You know what? I want to leave you with this. Because I have told your story on stages. I told you this before, and I mean this, I'm so proud of what you've done. Because going from being that worker bee, engineer type of job, right, which you can relate with, to go out there and want to change the impact of the world. How much money we make in the world is directly tied to the influence we have on how many people we influence. So if we only influence four people, well, you're going to get paid according to that. But if you go out and stand on stages and write books, you're influencing 100s of 1000s, millions of people, and that's not just financial wealth, that's the abundance of mindset and the sharing and you're doing that. I'm so proud of you and it's an honor to be on your podcasts and do this and have fun.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, thank you so much. And I love the fact that you are really the start of that journey. So it's so special to have you on. So thank you so much.

Mike Lindstrom:
Thank you. Appreciate you.

Christine Laperriere:
