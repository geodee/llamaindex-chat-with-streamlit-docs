Title: Inclusiveness counts
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Atul Tiwari

Christine Laperriere:
Today, I am going to interview Atul.
I'll have him introduce himself in a second.
But I'm thrilled that you accepted my invite because I worked with you at your days at Vanguard as a leader.
I got a chance to see all of the great things that you brought to that culture.
And one of the things that I always thought was impressive is when I worked at Vanguard, I always said everyone that I met was just fantastic.
There was something really unique and special about that environment.
So it made perfect sense to reach out to you and ask you if you'd be interested in coming on the show.
So thank you so much, Atul.

Atul Tiwari:
Thank you, Christine.
And I, too, really enjoyed working with you at Vanguard.
And you certainly helped us quite a bit on the sales side in terms of building a terrific sales team.
So thank you for that.
It's great to be here.
Thank you.
My background is I'm a reformed lawyer.
Started my career as a corporate securities lawyer.
And from there, went on to a number of different business roles, including starting the ETF business for Banco Montreal.
And then, as you pointed out, I was the CEO of Vanguard Canada, starting up Vanguard here.
So it's been it's been a lot of fun throughout my career.
And after Vanguard, I was thinking about what to do next.
And I'm very passionate about fine wine.
My wife is as well.
She was the head of the fine wine department at Ritchie's Auction House.
And I always knew that fine wine investing was something that was established in Europe and in Asia.
But it hadn't really been done in North America.
And so I built a business plan, reached out to the company that's the best in the world at doing this called Cult Wines.
And we set up a joint venture.
And from there in Canada and from there, I've now taken on the role of overseeing the U.S., Caribbean and Latin America as well.
So it's it's a lot of fun building a business.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm only going to tell you, I'm just slightly jealous.
So when I saw that you went into fine wine, first of all, I knew that about you as a passion.
So that felt right on brand.
And and also, I just I'm only slightly jealous because it's got to be a delicious job.

Atul Tiwari:
Yes, well, it's it's a lot of fun.
And, you know, somebody had said to me that if you can make your passion, your occupation, you'll never work another day in your life.
And I really feel that way.
It's it's just wonderful kind of marrying your interests of, in my case, fine wine and asset management.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.
We're going to dive in.
Tell us about the best boss that you ever had, or even if there were a few do share with us a little bit about what your experience has been.

Atul Tiwari:
There's definitely been a few.
And I've been fortunate through my career to have some wonderful bosses and, by the way, some not so wonderful bosses, which I think will as well.
But absolutely, you know, the best part, I think, of having experienced a number of different styles and leaders is you can learn from them and you can sort of select what you're going to become as a leader.
I think early in my career, I was fortunate because I had a boss who really took a lot of time with me to to teach me.
We would spend literally hours in his office with him imparting his knowledge about the investment industry to me.
So as a lawyer, it was important because I learned a lot more about the business, which makes you a better lawyer if you understand what your clients are experiencing and doing day to day.
So absolutely, I would say mentorship and sharing knowledge.
Those are traits, I think, of great leaders and great bosses.
My best boss ever, I would say, sort of embodies all of that.
And he was a very senior leader at BMO, Nesbitt Burns, Bank of Montreal.
He just was an incredible and is an incredible human being.
Just very kind, very experienced, always had your back.
No matter what what happened, he was he was in your corner and you knew that.
So you could take some risks knowing that that he was going to stand by you sort of thing.
And he was known around the company as as a leader that everybody wanted to work for.
And so I always felt fortunate to be working for him and reporting to him.
And people would always say, oh, you're so lucky.
I wish I was working for him.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
He had that draw.
So he had actually a magnetism where people were like, you're in a coveted position if you work for this boss.

Atul Tiwari:
That's right.
Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you give me some stories and examples a little bit of what you remember from that time?

Atul Tiwari:
The one that really stands out is when I moved from being a lawyer to taking on a management role, my first role was to head up the mutual fund division for Bank of Montreal in Chicago, Harris Bank.
And so, you know, it was a big step for me just transitioning into a role like that.
And it was a bit of an interesting situation in that the previous head had been terminated for the independent board, having lost confidence in him.
So I was put in essentially as a turnaround situation and getting ready for my first meeting was interesting.
I had prepared a lot and was ready to talk about how we're going to turn things around.
And when we got into the meeting, my voice was shaking.
I just thought, oh, goodness, because it was a pretty high profile, big meeting.
And I pulled it together eventually, but obviously was nervous.
And so after the meeting, I spoke to my boss and I said, sorry, you know, I don't know what happened there at the beginning.
But, you know, I did turn it around.
And, you know, he said something that really just made me feel good.
Which was, you know what, that's all you're passionate about this.
And, you know, you're not going to go into a meeting being a robot.
You know, you're a human being coming in and expressing yourself the way you did, showed that you care.
And, you know, it was that's just sort of what he was like.
He always kind of found the good in anything and made you feel good.

Christine Laperriere:
I like that because that's such a good example.
I actually it made me smile when you said that because I remember meeting you for the first time and being nervous.
And, you know, it's it's funny because I do remember how disarming you are.
You're you know, you don't give off that impression of you should be nervous.
Right.
Like, so all of a sudden, a few minutes into our conversation, it was like, OK, he doesn't he doesn't need me to be nervous right now.
I just remember that.
And when we first met, because, you know, just because of that perception of status or that nervousness that that comes.

Atul Tiwari:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
So that's neat that you bring that now to how you lead, where it's like you're a human, not a robot.

Atul Tiwari:
Absolutely.

Atul Tiwari:
And, you know, there's no need to be different at work than you are in your day to day life, I think.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
Any other things that you can think of that, you know, as you were working for this leader, I think that's a great example.
Other things that come to mind.

Atul Tiwari:
Yeah, I would just say, you know, I learned a lot from him about developing people.
And to me, again, as a great leader, that is not just something you do.
I think it's an obligation.
And so he was known for having developed a number of great leaders around BMO.
And so I think that is something that I took with me as well throughout the rest of my career, which was, you know, you really need to take an interest in the people that work with you.
You know, help coach, develop.
Those are important things.
And so I think that was another element that has influenced me, I think, over time.
The other part of it is just inclusiveness.
And I think he was inclusive before it was trendy, you know, to be inclusive.
He's, you know, a white male who's had a terrific career in life.
But, you know, he was very open in terms of the people that were around his table from a management standpoint.
And for me personally, I benefited from him bringing me into settings and surroundings that I wouldn't naturally be in.
And so when I talk about my passion for fine wine, it was Barry was a member of an ice golf club.
You know, he himself is very, very passionate about wine and very knowledgeable.
So not just working for him or with him, but also just how he included me in certain events with his wine group, for example, where you got to experience some fine wines that I had never experienced before.
And quite frankly, as a person of color, often I would be the only person of color at those events.
But, you know, that's something that I definitely also think I took from him, which was, you know, when you have the ability to include people in things that they naturally may not have been part of and to help either educate them around it or if they're interested, you know, coax their interests.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great.
That's important.
And that's so interesting because I didn't even think of that until you just said it, but that feeling of, you know, being included at a time when you didn't, you know, like you said, it probably wasn't trendy yet.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So you might not have always went to environments and felt as included.

Atul Tiwari:
That's right.
Yeah, absolutely.
And so, you know, to have somebody as a mentor who brings you along in those types of environments is important.
I mean, and that's, you know, that's something I think all leaders should pay attention to.
I think we've talked about this before as well, which is, you know, whether you're a person of color or a female, you know, you're your mentor or the people that you work for or with.
It's important that they include you in those social settings, like outside of work, because that's, you know, let's face it.
That's where a lot of discussions happen and other leaders get to know you better and then will naturally promote you along the way.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Very something interesting about what you just shared as well.
So, you know, the making connections in a social setting or in a social way, right, like building friendships.
I just remember distinctly when we were working on some of the cultural pieces.
And one of the things that scored really well on the team that that we both worked with was that the engagement question.
I have a best friend at work and that one scored incredibly high.
And I remember thinking how interesting that was, just given the fact that the culture felt so unique and different.
So it's again, very interesting to me to hear that correlation or that tie back to the fact that somebody made you feel like a friend.

Atul Tiwari:
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Versus just a colleague.

Atul Tiwari:
Yes, absolutely.
It's that's a good feeling.
And quite frankly, you work harder for somebody like that because you feel like you're invested in the business and clients and success, not just for yourself, but also for your team and for your leader.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's that's huge.
So then tell me a little bit about your experiences of the not so great bosses.
Like, what did they do that that left a mark and shaped the way you think about leadership?

Atul Tiwari:
Well, it's almost the opposite of everything I just said.
And one boss in particular, and I won't say the name, was somebody who, no matter what you did, would make you feel like you did something wrong.
And even, you know, even if it was right, you squirmed because you thought, oh, boy, you know, he's going to come at me with this or that.
And you never felt like you were on the same side.
It really felt like you were being grilled for a reason.
And, you know, in particular, one of my colleagues made a call and actually made the wrong call.
And he called the entire department in and berated her for having made the call she made.
And there was an economic impact due to the call that she made.
And basically, he said, you're going to be paying that back.
And, you know, she was more of a junior person.
And so those of us who were maybe a little more senior kind of stepped in and said, come on, that's, you know, that's that's not right.
We're a team, et cetera, et cetera.
But, you know, that's the kind of thing that would happen.
And it was it was a it was essentially a toxic environment.
And you could hear him sometimes, you know, with the door closed, basically yelling at some of your colleagues.
And it was not a good environment at all.
So I would say, you know, that's sort of the exact opposite, which is rather than always feeling like your your boss has your back.
In that case, it was, you know, you were scared.
You walked around on eggshells.

Christine Laperriere:
Like you said, it's almost the opposite.
You're waiting for your boss to stab you in the back.

Atul Tiwari:
That is exactly right.

Christine Laperriere:
The look over your shoulder at all times.

Atul Tiwari:
The hard part for somebody who has a boss who's insecure is that sometimes, you know, your boss, because they're insecure and maybe don't feel confident in their position, they want more control.
And, you know, that's a difficult situation because they do like to control information.
So I had a boss, you know, she she was very much that way.
And previous to that boss, you know, had a lot of interaction with very senior people.
But then when that boss came in, she said, OK, anything you send by email or otherwise to these senior people, you got to put it through me first.
Right.
And then you kind of get the sense that obviously she's controlling the message.
Right.
And I I don't think that's a good approach.
I think no matter who you are in an organization, the channels of communication should be open.
It shouldn't be filtered.
You know, and as a leader, you want that.
You want to hear from people whether it's a good thing or not a good thing.
Because, you know, obviously, if it's not a good thing, you can work on making that better.
But if you don't hear that, you won't know.

Christine Laperriere:
I can tell you right now, there's a lot of people listening to that and they can resonate with that.
So the controlling of information is a very interesting one because it doesn't look as obvious as yelling at somebody or berating somebody.
It's a much more like you said, it's driven from insecurity.
And it's very subtle because it doesn't feel as obvious and as wrong as the example you gave earlier.
Right.
But in the same breath, I see that at a lot of people.
They feel that right.
They feel not trusted.
They don't feel valued.
They don't feel brought in as the team.
So with the controlling of information really does kind of like break down a team, but it's so much more subtle because it doesn't feel, you know, it doesn't feel as obvious.

Atul Tiwari:
That's right.
And it's not an open environment.
And I think you need to sort of foster an open environment where people feel like they can, you know, express their opinions in a constructive way.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that's great.
So, you know, one of the questions that I always love to ask leaders.
So obviously, in my business, I'm an added expense.
Right.
As I work on the culture and I work on the people and the development of leaders.
And so I always try to understand.
I get this question.
What's the return on investment?
Right.
And so what do you think the impact is to the bottom line when you're working for a best boss ever or you're working for somebody who really is aspiring to operate at that level?

Atul Tiwari:
Yeah.
Well, look, I've never thought of you as an added expense.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you.

Atul Tiwari:
You pay for your your your services and help by, you know, building much better sales teams.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And obviously does go to the bottom line.
So yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean, it's hard to say, Christine.
I mean, you know, there's a lot of intangibles there.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And it's hard to actually point to a bottom line impact of great leadership.
I mean, I think I think all of the things we've talked about just sort of make for a better environment for for people to, you know, work as a team to build a better business and service clients better.
And ultimately that translates to bottom line, I think.
So I'm not sure there's a direct you can't sort of measure it.
It's just something I think that we know it's it's an intuitive thing.
Well, now I can say that another really smart person also said the same thing, because that's I run into a similar answer where I'm always like, it's intangible, but it's felt.
And so even though we'll never be able to do a split and say, OK, here's what the business numbers would be without great leaders and here's the business numbers with great leaders, we're never going to be able to really have those two scenarios side by side.
But what I do know is just what you said.
When you build an environment that helps people perform at a much higher rate, the impact is there.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Atul Tiwari:
And you know, and you can almost make an analogy to marketing, right, which is it's a constant tension between what do you spend to build your brand versus you spend to acquire clients.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And there's no right answer to that.
It's it's just, you know, that you have to spend something to build your brand.
It's intangible.
You don't know what that return is, but you know, you have to do it.
It's felt exactly, especially when it's not there.
When there's a vacuum of it, it's very noticeable, too.
You know, so it's interesting when you mention this, because it's it's always this I feel like one day we're going to be able to analyze or understand the numbers, but it's very tricky to actually put exact dollars to these things.
Right.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.
Yeah, that's great.
So if you are going to teach or advise future leaders, the best part is that all kinds of people that I work with today listen to the show for different ideas and insights to be a better leader.
So if you were going to teach or advise them, what would be some words of wisdom or things that you would ask them to think about as we wrap this show up?

Atul Tiwari:
Well, I actually had somebody tell me early in my career that it's important to listen.
That kind of always stuck with me.
And so I think active listening is an important skill set.
Not everybody has it.
I think it kind of goes hand in hand with taking an interest in the people that you work with and understanding their motivations, understanding what drives them in life, you know, what makes them happy, what makes them unhappy.
And so I think that is an important trait to develop, you know, your active listening skills.
Sort of beyond that, I guess, you know, the other part of it that maybe goes with that is the empathy, right?
We all know that there are tough decisions that have to be made in business from time to time.
But, you know, you can always do things in an empathetic way.
And I think as we started the conversation, you know, you have to remember, look, we're all human beings.
We're all people with feelings.
And I think it's important to respect those.
And I think, you know, both of those sound both of those pieces of wisdom you just shared, they sound easy at first glance, but they're quite powerful when implemented.
That's kind of what I would say, because, you know, listening is such an interesting one.
People perceive silence is equating to listening.
It's definitely not.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Atul Tiwari:
There's a quality, right?
And look, we've all been in meetings where we've had the people who come in and talk the loudest and the longest and kind of like hearing the sound of their voice.
But I think there's there's power in listening.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Atul Tiwari:
And then that piece around empathy, too, which, you know, I think it gets lost quickly when especially I mean, you're in businesses where numbers matter.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Atul Tiwari:
And so you're always looking at numbers and, you know, financials and, you know, dollars and cents.
So it's trying to be able to balance the fact that the numbers are not the only story.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right.
Absolutely.
Well, listen, thank you so much for giving me this time.
Do you have anything else that you want to share today just as people are listening?

Atul Tiwari:
No, I think we we covered a lot of issues in the short period of time, Christine.
So once again, just thank you for for having me.
And it's been a fun discussion.
And hopefully some of the people who listen to this may may pick up something from from what we've been talking about.

Christine Laperriere:
And that's part of the giving back and sharing your experiences.
Amazing.
And then they should go find you on LinkedIn as the CEO of Colt Wines.

Atul Tiwari:
Absolutely.
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
They want to find out more about investing in top end wine.
They should come follow you, right?

Atul Tiwari:
But it's it's the place to come, for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Atul Tiwari:
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Christine.
