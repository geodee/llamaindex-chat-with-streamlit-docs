Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelapperiere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. Today. I have Rob Hartnett with me and I am thrilled that he took the opportunity to come on my show. And just before I get started, I'm going to tell you a little bit about how I know Rob. So Rob and I both were independent sales consultants when we worked for Miller Heiman. We were doing sales transformation work all over the world, actually. And one of the things that was so neat is we went to one of our annual sales conferences and Rob was the top performer that year. And he was celebrated as having the best performance and the best accomplishments.

Christine Laperriere:
And one of the things that I loved seeing is just kind of the natural, people-centric, high energy, motivating excitement you brought that year to the event. Instead of it being all about you, you really made it all about everyone and you really celebrated everybody in the organization that year. So I was part of your fan club then, I'm still your fan club now. And since you've gone on to do some amazing things, some independent things, you've written a book, It's All Possible, you've led the It's All Possible podcast, which I'm going to be a guest on soon. Rob, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Rob Hartnett:
Absolute delight, Christine. Absolute delight.

Christine Laperriere:
And anything you want to just share with us about how people can find if they love what you have to say today.

Rob Hartnett:
For sure. So you just mentioned the podcast which I do, the It's All Possible podcast on Apple and Spotify and on the C-Suite Network. You can also find me at my business, which is Proteus Leadership. So I'm one of the team at proteusleadership.com based in Melbourne, Australia. So that's the best way to find me. I'm on all socials. I'm not hard to find so just @robhartnett is the easiest way to do it.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm going to dive in with the question of the day, who is your best boss ever, and why? Tell us all about him.

Rob Hartnett:
I really struggled with the question. I'm simple. I'm from Australia. No, I'm kidding. I really struggle with it because I've had so many great leaders. I really have. And I have had so many great leaders and I really struggled with so many. But I did pick one. But is it okay if I mention a few and then I'll get to the one?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Rob Hartnett:
I find there's so many great leaders because I look for the best in everybody and I find you can learn from everybody. And I've learned so much from so many through my career at different stages at the right times. Clearly one that you and I worked with, he wasn't our direct boss, but to me, he was a boss. And that was Sam Reese, the CEO of Miller Heiman, and the other CEO at Vistage. And Sam and I still keep in touch. He's still unbelievable. He was on my podcast last year. So Sam to me was a great leader. I also work for a guy called Steve Vamos, who was the head of country for Apple when I was at Apple in Australia. And Steve is now the CEO of Xero with the great accounting software business. At HP, I had so many. Lew Platt who was the global president and chairman and everything. And I did have some interactions with Lew and I really enjoyed Lew's abilities to communicate to 145,000 employees. It was something that I rarely see even today.

Rob Hartnett:
And two other Australian-based leaders, John Bieske and Bruce Thompson who were the Australian-based leaders at HP. Andrew Carter and Paul Royce in my computing days when I was an IT reseller. They ran a very hard, tough, competitive business, but I learned so much from them. Tim Nicole Jones, who led me at the ad agency Mojo. You didn't have this in here, but I thought I'd put it in. I won a world yachting championship in 1994 and sailing with the great American Ken Reid. And Ken's a six time world champion, president of north sales. He's just an amazing lead. He's a personal friend. Ken, certainly he taught me a lot and I still use his leadership techniques when I'm talking to people today. That's kind of a list. I hope that was okay.

Christine Laperriere:
I have to tell you something really side note. So ever since I started doing the show, I love talking to people about their best boss ever. And what I will say is that it's always unfortunate how many people can only recall stories from their worst boss, but it's very hard for them to scale back and think about where their best bosses might have been. And so I'm listening to that company list, first of all. So those are some great organizations and it actually brings me a lot of hope just to hear that you actually have such a long list of great leaders.

Rob Hartnett:
And some of those leaders like for example, Sam, now CEO of Vistage, Steve Vamos, who is head of country at Apple is now CEO globally of Xero. He was a board member of Telstra and many others and head of Microsoft out here. And so what I find is that the good leaders, if you follow them, you'll see they've got a trajectory. It's not that they don't make mistakes. Sam was incredibly candid with me on my podcast, he said some things I didn't think Sam would say. It was really exciting because he's authentic. So I think you got to look for it though, Christine. I think it's really easy to find the faults in people. We all make mistakes. None of us are perfect. I know you are, but I'm not. You are perfect. We all make mistakes, so I think I like to just look for the best. But I did pick one. Do you want me to talk about the one I picked?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Tell us a little bit more about them.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. So the guy I picked for this one, and I said there was so many. But a guy by the name of Kim Hamilton. Kim Hamilton was my boss at HP. He brought me into HP and was my boss there when I was running emerging products. So I came from Apple into HP. The reason I put on Kim is that he was a kind of a low key leader. And what I mean by that was he really empowered people and he built non-dependent empowered teams, which I think is the real game for leaders today. If you're a leader and you are complaining, everyone's coming to you and winking to you and you've got problems you're solving and you're really working all these hours, that's on you because you've built a team of people who are dependent on you. And Kim did, was coming from Toshiba into HP, which was very interesting because HP had a lot of people they had just basically promoted internally because it was such a great company.

Rob Hartnett:
And Kim came in from Toshiba and he realized that they needed someone different to run emerging products. This is the newer products that were coming to market. You'll laugh when I say this, but one of my emerging products I ran was color printing. We're going back mid-90s.

Christine Laperriere:
You're dating yourself now. Yes.

Rob Hartnett:
I'm dating myself. But there was also a whole bunch of other products I had. And they wanted someone different. And so he fought for me. And I came from Apple. In Apple, we were evangelists for innovators. We're always the underdog. So he needed that kind of spirit. And so Kim fought for me and I remember the interviews I had at HP. And the first interview I went there and I just wanted to be there. I just wanted to join HP so bad. And they kind were a bit edgy with me. And [inaudible 00:06:30] was my greatest reference who I thought it would be my golden reference. Basically told them, "He won't last there because you guys are too slow for him." I'm like, "Thank you. That not exactly what I want you to say." But to his point. And so I remember Kim really fighting for me. And Kim saying, "Look, can you come back? I've got one more interview with John Bieske." who was the head of Australia at the time.

Rob Hartnett:
And I came back in and I sat there with John and John and Kim were there and John was running it. And John just said, "I'm just not sure Rob, I'm just not sure you'd be able to fit into the culture here. I don't think you'd fit the culture. I think you're really nice. I think you have a great record but I just don't think HP's the place for you." And I was so devastated. And then Kim kind of jumped in and he let me tell my story. And at the end of it before I was going, I said to John, "John, I really appreciate your view and the whole thing, but I'm coming here one day." And John turned around to Kim and he said, "Fetch your attitude Hartnett, you can come now." That was so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
That is great.

Rob Hartnett:
It was Kim fighting for me. And then when I had to do a lot of things, I had to break a lot of rules at HP or establish things like we've always done it this way here, Kim would back me. And I think it's so important as a leader, he would back me. He would go, "Yep. That's fine now, I'm backing Rob." And Christine, you'll love this little story. When I went to HP, HP used has to have fleets of cars, all GM cars. So the car park at HP and Melbourne was full of GM cars, all these General Motors cars because we all bought them on the lease for the salary plan. I was driving a Porsche 911. That was my car.

Christine Laperriere:
Breaking the rules.

Rob Hartnett:
Because at Apple, that was almost the standard car, like four or five of us had Porsches. So I've come with my 911 and it was this hot car. It was so loud, it used to set off car alarms and the GM cars. And then someone went and complained. A leader behind my back came and complained to Kim and said, "Hey, who's this guy you've hired? How much money are you paying him? He's driving a fricking Porsche 911." And you know what Kim said? Kim said to this guy, this leader, a peer of Kim's. He said, "Yeah. It's good. We're all getting them."

Christine Laperriere:
Nice.

Rob Hartnett:
He joined my team. So at every point, even with a sense of humor, he had your back. And he empowered me. He empowered my team. He allowed me to bring on people who allowed me to cut through red tape and really transform, and with John's support. But Kim was just an amazing leader, backed me in so many ways. And when I went on to my next role to head up the personal computer business in HP, Kim was my biggest supporter.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's such a good example, that point about being able to cut through red tape and break rules. I'm working with a client today who was just talking about being an entrepreneur and we were kind of comparing notes. And he said, "I worked for Chrysler and I didn't feel supported in being an entrepreneur. I actually am much more supported as an external resource to businesses who ask me for all of that difficult, out of the box thinking because when I'm in the doors of the company, they don't appreciate it." They're like, "We wish you'd go away now."

Rob Hartnett:
And you're you're right. And it depends on the company. And certainly when I came from Apple, innovation was such a part of what we did and creative thinking and out of the box thinking was such a great place to be. So coming to HP, that was not what they normally did, but we did it. And I remember once I did a competition. So I had to get these particular devices really selling fast. And so what I did was I put together this competition. And the competition was based around sales of course, based around sales and volume and sell through. But I was going to reward the top sellers. Now typically, the sellers I was talking about for this product were in retail so they were between the ages about sort of 19 and 23.

Rob Hartnett:
I said, "I'm going to fly you to Melbourne." which many of them hadn't even been to. "I'm going to put you up at a five-star hotel. I'm going to take you to dinner. And we're going to go down the river by boat to see AC/DC in concert and you've got great tickets." Now, when I launched this, it didn't take off. I thought this was the most amazing package. It didn't take off. It was like a three-month campaign. The first month it was dead. I rang around a few of the dealers who work with HP and I said, "Are you getting behind this?" And they go, "Is it real? This is so un-HP. We have never done it. It's bullshit."

Christine Laperriere:
There you go. There's two out of the-

Rob Hartnett:
"Welcome to the party, my friend." And once I got that one over the line, oh my God, it was game on. But they just didn't do that kind of stuff. And even though John and Kim had backed me, the reaction from the channel was like, "Oh no, I'd say it's boring. We might go and see Mozart, we might go to the opera. AC/DC, for like 18 and 20 year olds?" They would've had such a great time.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic. I love that story. That is a great story. Any others from some of the bosses that you've worked for? So you had such an incredible list. I love the examples that you're telling though. These are great.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. I'll talk about Lew Platt. He's passed away now, but Lew was an amazing leader. As I said to you, one of the things that's amazing about Lew was he had staff of 145,000. And remember this is the days before Teams and Slack and all these kind of tools. But I knew. I was in Blackburn in Melbourne, Australia, and I knew exactly what Lew was thinking. Why? Because every month Lew would make a call. He would do a call where he would address everybody. And everyone just put the phones down, put the email down, and we listened to Lew for 45 minutes of where he was taking the business. And at one point, I just got so connected with where he was going and I'd read Forbes magazine and I'd read all these different magazines, also about HP and about Lew and all the big companies.

Rob Hartnett:
And I was a huge provider with Intel because I sold a lot of Intel PCs and I was head of PCs at the time. And I remember being at a Gartner conference and there was a whole lot of rumors around. What had happened, Lew had been at a Gartner conference, I think in Italy, and was on his flight back to the US. And he'd said something. And he was a very off the cuff, authentic leader. And they'd misinterpret it and made this kind of really big headline. And I saw it and I went, "Oh my God, there's a Gartner conference happening in Australia. They might say something about HP." So I said to my colleagues, "I'm going to email Lew and let him know that this has been misinterpreted so when he lands in the US, he'll understand it." And I just got laughed at, honestly, Christine.

Rob Hartnett:
People said, "You want to email Lew Platt? Good on you." You know what Australians can be like, pretty sarcastic. "Yeah. Get on, mate. You may have a go at that one. Yeah. Call Lew." So I literally emailed Lew and said, Lew, I read this. I met a guy at a conference in Brisbane. He wanted me to say anything else because I'm going to be on stage. I was actually on a panel. If it comes up, I just want to let you know this how the press has interpreted it." That was it. I left it. I didn't know. Next morning, 8:00 AM. "Hi, Rob. Lew here. Thanks so much for letting me know. I made it kind of a boo-boo in Italy. I didn't mean to say what I said. They misinterpreted it by the time I was on the flight. Thank you for picking it up and working the time zones for me. Here's the paragraph to use if it comes into question. Thank you so much. Lew Platt.

Rob Hartnett:
I literally printed that out and just walked around there the office for like an hour with a badge. But you know what? The thing about that, Christine, was me reaching out to Lew on that and him coming back authentically. And it was him, not his EA. But it made such a difference because about 12 months later, I realized, not only me, but my team and I realized that we needed to build a factory in Australia to build HP PCs. And guess who's approval we needed?

Christine Laperriere:
Lew's.

Rob Hartnett:
We needed Lew's. And Lew came out and opened it for us. And when he came to Australia and he met me, he knew. And it was 12 months ago. He knew we'd had that connection. And it made such a difference, I think, to getting it approved for the first time. And secondly, him coming out with his wife to open up the new factory in Australia. And so I think if you reach out to leaders... I was generally doing it from a place of care and empathy because I've had myself misquoted in press. You probably have had something similar too. But I could see the position that it could cause. And of course, HP is a public company. It's a big deal for a lot of people. And it was simply a misinterpretation. So I love what he did in that area.

Rob Hartnett:
John Bieske, who was a leader in Australia for a long, long time of all the personal computer business and so much business. He was there for many, many years. What I love about John, as I said to you, when I left HP, John and I left about the same time, although he'd been there some 25 years or something. When I was leaving HP, John saw me and he said, "Rob, the day you came and you first joined us, I said to myself, and I said to Kim, your boss, 'Don't worry. He'll come along but we'll change him. We'll get him to fit.' You know what? You changed us."

Christine Laperriere:
I love hearing that. That's powerful.

Rob Hartnett:
And when you have a leader, he doesn't have to say that. And John would write Christmas cards to everyone of his staff every year personally and hand them out. It must have been like 350, but he would do them. That was what John did. He knew everybody. He knew everybody's name. So people like that, Bruce Thompson, who was his leader, was very similar in many ways as well. They empowered people. They backed people. They trusted people. So they were to me, very authentic leaders, very approachable leaders. But also importantly, they were leaders who did two things that I teach people every week to do.

Rob Hartnett:
I teach new emerging leaders every week to do. They catch the good stuff and they call out the bad stuff and they do it early. They catch the good stuff early. They encourage you. They thank you. They recognize improvement. They do it. They don't walk past it. They don't forget about it. And the other thing they do is they'll call out bad behavior if they see it. And that doesn't mean the person's bad. It just means it's not aligned to what we're doing. It's not what we do around here. It's affecting the rest of your team. Whether that's me or anybody else, they would call it out and say, "No, you can't say that." or "You can't do that." or whatever it happens to be. You'll find the best leaders in the world will do that. They'll catch the good stuff. They'll call out the bad stuff and they know when they're doing it.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. And so I find it interesting that both of us made the leap from sales transformation to leadership transformation. And so even though this question's not necessary early on script, I'm curious for you why that transition for you? I know why I transitioned.

Rob Hartnett:
Well, for me, I'd say it was simple, but it's not. It took a lot of time to work it out. And it was really through my work at Miller Heiman Group and when I was involved in the large transformations and mid-size transformations and small transformations. So whether they were small, large, global, so we worked on some big ones, you and I worked on some very large transformations. And people would come to me for the next one and go, "Rob, what's the secret source to making sure it works, it sticks, it's adaptable, it keeps on going. What is the secret source?" And I really got it down to three things, Christine and I still believe in those three things. The three things are leadership, accountability and discipline. And if any one of those three is missing, it will fall over or it will be short-lived.

Rob Hartnett:
Once I looked at that and I came back to going, you know what, but it's the leader who really drives the accountability and the discipline and is the leadership and management coming together. Leadership gets you going and management keeps you going. So when I looked at that, it starts with leadership. So to me, when I looked at what I was doing in the sales space, I thought there's more I can do here. And I have a passion for leadership. I love leadership. I love seeing it. I love seeing leaders lead. I see leaders grow, and I love it. And you're probably the same, but I've had a number of people who work for me still write to me and go, "Thank you for impacting me. Thank you for where I am now."

Rob Hartnett:
And they're in great positions and I love it. I love seeing LinkedIn profile and they're going to some huge role and you had something to do with that hopefully somewhere along the line. That's why I wanted to get into leadership because I could impact. And I think I was starting with John Maxwell and John Maxwell said this. He said, "The more leaders you can impact is the more people you'll impact." And that's where it was the catalyst for me. How do I get scale in this? The more leaders I can impact, the more people I can impact that we have more transformational leaders who lead with kindness and with empathy and understanding, and that's okay. And you realize you don't have to be this authority of my way or the highway, highly directed, don't know how to spell diversity type person, then we don't need that.

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny that you say that. We're so aligned in that. I used to see huge transformation projects. And just like you said, it was really reliant on the leader, but it was also reliant on how much people wanted to follow that leader because lots of leaders can come in and say, "Okay, everybody, scoot over. We have the big change." or "We have the next big assignment." But if people weren't engaged and bought in, it was just a long, miserable, frustrating process. So as an outsider, I had very little to do, ironically, with which ones were successful. It was usually if I could align with a fantastic leader who had, just like you said, some of these qualities, I just find those changes would go so well and I just got to be there and cheer it on.

Rob Hartnett:
Yeah. And it's so much easier for you and so much easier for the team to have those transformational leaders who are willing to do that. And luckily, I've been able to work with a number of those really good leaders and they would be fantastic catalysts to me too, because when we came to doing big change, I'd say, "Would you be happy to talk to this particular client who's looking to do this similar thing?" I can't tell you how many. I remember one, a major bank. And I spoke to this guy who's very successful in financial services. And they said, "Sounds like a lot of hard work. He was actually telling us about all the hard stuff we've got to do."

Rob Hartnett:
And I'm like, "Well, it's kind of why I got him to talk to you." "Yeah. But he was really saying there's a lot of stuff to do and can take a while and we're not so sure that we really want to do this." And I said, "Well, good, because you're not going to waste my time or anybody else's. So you need to understand going from A to B is not as simple, is not a straight line. And I could set you up for success, but you've got to want to put in the effort."

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You don't want to be living through those types of transformations and having your name attached to them. They're brutal.

Rob Hartnett:
Yes. You know it's just going to go south really fast.

Christine Laperriere:
So one of the questions that I love to ask, and I think I'm really curious about your answer on this. What do you think the impact is to the bottom line of working for a best boss ever?

Rob Hartnett:
In my experience, it's been massive. And again, I think not only bottom line, I think there's bottom line, but also for me, what I've seen working for a best boss ever has been an increase in things like customer set, increase in employee retention, increase in innovation, employee satisfaction themselves, culture. If you do a culture pulse, it's always good and getting better. But absolutely. If I look at one, just to give an example of this and I can't work the numbers out, but one of the other best boss ever I worked for was a guy called Anthony McMan. And Anthony and I were the ones who pulled the PC business together. But Anthony was my boss, but Anthony was so, so sharp. He spent many, many years as a very senior leader at SAP after HP.

Rob Hartnett:
But Anthony pulled together a team and knew the strengths of all of us. He knew my strength was in the inspirational or empowerment, getting everyone on board, getting the team together, getting our channel members to follow us, to build these programs. Anthony was about tasks and projects and pulling the team together. He knew where his strengths were. He was great as strategic leader. He was great at stakeholder management. And he just pulled a fantastic team together. And that allowed us to do what we do now. Here's what we did. We took HP PCs. This is to give an idea on metrics, from number 17 in the country in Australia to number one in under 18 months. Now you work the metrics on volume of shipping of product. Now you talk about bottom line. We dramatically changed the bottom line. We got recognized right around the world for what we did.

Rob Hartnett:
I won a HP high achiever award for it, which was kind of embarrassing, because it was so many people involved. But you know what we also did? We grew our channel members, so the channel members who sold our product, who hung with us for so long when we were 15 and 16 and we took them to number one. The volume they did, the families that we made wealthy, the kids we put through private schools, that's bottom line for me. That's what we did. We did a good bottom line at HP. We affected so many more people.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing. Great story. That is amazing. If you had to sum it up, what advice would you say to any of the leaders that are listening to the show that are trying to become a best boss ever? What would be your pieces of wisdom for them?

Rob Hartnett:
It's funny I got asked this question by a leader this week so it was great prep although I didn't know you were going to ask it. I think the number one thing in this day and age, because we are coming through a pandemic, we're coming out the other end. I'm in Melbourne. If you don't know, we've been the most locked down city in the world past bonus areas about three weeks ago. We're world champions, Christine. We're very happy about... No, we're not.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. Winning the COVID award.

Rob Hartnett:
Winning the COVID award. I'm putting this in context. So the number one thing in any case, but I think more so now, is create a culture of psychological safety. If you haven't got psychological safety, you will not have any innovation. Andy Stanley says a great quote. And he says, "Leaders who aren't prepared to listen will be surrounded by people with nothing to say." If you have psychological safety, you'll have innovation. You'll have diversity. You'll have great ideas. You'll have people coming to you. You'll have people who are empowered and non-dependent right. So I think that's for me, because psychological safety is so important. And that means reaching out to your people. That means your people need your visibility, not your great vision right now. So connect with your people, making sure they feel comfortable. Are the ideas coming? If they're not coming and everyone's going quiet, what's going on.

Rob Hartnett:
So that's the first one. So psychological safety for me. Have that kind of culture of innovation and ideas. It doesn't matter how big your group is or how small your group is. A really great leader told me a good story he did when he was driving up startups, he was a serial entrepreneur. And one of the things they used to do was weekly failure meetings. So every Friday, you had to bring along something that you failed at that week, but you learnt from. And no one could come without it. You couldn't come along and laugh at me, Christine. You can't say, "Rob, you're an idiot." but you didn't do anything. So everyone came to the meeting and you had to come with what did you do this week?

Rob Hartnett:
And it could be, "I sent a direct mail out. It just didn't work. I tried something on social media and it didn't work. We did a TikTok video and it did work." You had to come along with something you tried that was different, but didn't work. And it's the fastest way to test. Do we have a culture of innovation? Do we feel psychologically safe? Now another colleague of mine... Funny enough, another guy on a podcast earlier told me a great story. When he tried this whole idea, he came in to talk about not value meetings, just where were we up to of all our projects. Tell us everything. He went around the room and I said, "How did that go?" And he said, "Dismal. No one volunteered anything." And then he said, "So I closed the meeting down in 15 minutes. And I went around and in my discovery and said, "Why wouldn't you prepare to share?"

Rob Hartnett:
And they said, "Well, we only share our outcomes at the end and we're halfway through and it's not going so well. And we don't want to tell anybody that." And he realized straight away these people are not psychologically safe. This environment, I have to change that up. So as a leader, he brought that on himself and he said, "No, I want to go under the hood. I want to know what the problems are." And again, first thing modeled the way. It's the number one thing from [inaudible 00:24:58] and the leadership challenges model the way. First thing he did was go, "Hey, this is where I failed. Guys, this is the project I'm working on, it's not going well. I thought I'd be going a lot better. I'm missing target." So one, model away. Secondly, psychological safety. And really work on this whole thing of non-dependent, empowered, effective people. Great leaders create more leaders.

Rob Hartnett:
If you actually think about that, if you think about all the best boss ever you probably heard on your program or spoken to, they will have created more leaders. How do you more leaders? And the way you do that is who's replacing you? So you're a leader, who's replacing you? Is it anyone in your team or are you going to go, "God, no, why would any of these people take my job? Well, then I'd have a serious think about how you answered that because you are going to be stuck in that job forever. So who's your next replacement? And when you are recruiting your next team member, would there be someone you'd be happy to hand the reins over to?

Christine Laperriere:
Those are some fantastic words of wisdom. So all I can say is thank you so much for being on the show.
