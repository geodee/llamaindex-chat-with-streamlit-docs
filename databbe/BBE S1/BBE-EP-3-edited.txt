Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
All right. Kim, thank you so much for being on the show. This is such a pleasure. And just before we get started, I'm going to just mention why I invited you to come onto the show. And it's really because I had the luxury of working with you years and years ago in the same consulting firm. And it was just so neat because people would say to me, as I was new to the organization, "Oh, it looks like you're going to be the next Kim." And so it's such a neat thing because I've just had the chance to work with you and I look up to you so much. It was such a compliment.

Christine Laperriere:
I remember early in my career it being such a compliment for people to say that they could picture me filling the shoes one day of Kim Carlin. So it just made sense to have you on the Best Boss Ever show and hear a bit about your perspective on different bosses that you've worked with in the consulting world, different bosses that you've worked for, just some of your perspectives on leadership given now that you're in a leadership capacity yourself.

Kim Carlin:
Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
I'm excited. So maybe just to start, do you want to give a little bit of context around your career and how you've seen leadership unfold?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah, absolutely. So as you know I've had a lot long career in management consulting. I started my career in a small boutique firm right out of my MBA. So I was pretty new to the world of management at that time. I accelerated through the ranks over the course of the first five, eight years, moved my way up to managing partner in the firm and ultimately was responsible for global business development.

Kim Carlin:
So I reported into one of the founding partners, had a team of people working for me as well as had the luxury of working in over 200 businesses all over the world in virtually every different industry. So that has been a really great experience. And then most recently I transitioned out of my consulting career, moved over to the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, where I've been working there on executive coaching, teaching a leadership development curriculum to executive MBA students. And that's again, been a really fascinating experience working with that cohort of people, future emerging leaders.

Kim Carlin:
And then most recently I've taken a leadership position with CIBC. So I'm going to be supporting them with a transformation effort over the next five years. So that's a little bit of background to me. I have a undergraduate degree in sociology and MBA in strategy and a PhD where I focused exclusively on leadership development and in particular female executive leaders, which is important part of interest for me.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. An Important niche. So then given that, when we talk about that whole idea of best boss ever, I'm curious in your work experience, you probably had the experience of working for, let's say a best boss, but also I know you worked in that small boutique firm for a long time. So what was your perspective on some of the leadership that you observed there and the culture?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah, that's a terrific question. I think growing up in consulting is a little bit of a unique background from a leadership standpoint. So consulting by its very nature is extraordinarily competitive. And I think our firm wasn't different in that regard. We had a culture very heavily male dominated in the early days of the firm. I was the only woman in the firm, a lot of folks that had come from competitive sports environment. So it was this real, highly competitive jock masculine type of culture. I would almost say that the leadership style was punitive in nature.

Kim Carlin:
So there was a bit of a fear, results were everything. You could go from hero to zero really quickly. So I would actually, if I was to be extraordinarily candid, probably suggest that what I learned about leadership from within my organization was the type of leader I didn't want to be. So the fact that I felt that there were gaps in terms of how I was treated, in terms of the way that I was ultimately respected.

Kim Carlin:
And I think that was a big learning for me was to be different in my own leadership style, to be more true to myself, which would've been more interested in engagement, more interested in knowing my staff, more interested in letting them be creative, take risks, et cetera, than the way I was actually managed.

Kim Carlin:
So I think that's an interesting background in terms of my experience with my own personal boss. Certainly over my career in consulting I worked in lots of environments with clients that I would say were great representations of best bosses, people that really took a genuine interest in their staff really had true engagement from their staff.

Kim Carlin:
And even my experience at Rotman over the course of the last three years had a leader there that she was extraordinarily results focused as well, very strong personality type, but valued inclusivity, valued everyone having a voice at the table. Very much was about us being creative, taking risks, creating a culture where risk was rewarded and succeed or fail. It was really about learning. And I felt that that was quite different from, call it my 15 year history in consulting. It was actually quite refreshing. So I think that my own leadership style has really been developed from this unique facet of different kinds of leaders that I've had experience with over the course of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
So can you give me some examples, when you think of that experience with your leader at Rotman, when you talk about risk taking, being rewarded, can you just share a little more detail about what does that look like?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Absolutely. So part of my responsibility there was developing programs and curriculum to support our executive MBA programs. And in fact, the program that I was working in was a brand new program for executives in the health and life science sector. So we were kind of inventing the program. The thinking was, is that most of these folks that were in the program were already pretty advanced in their career so they would already be pretty established leaders.

Kim Carlin:
So one of the things that we found out pretty quickly was that some of the deficiencies, even from these people that on the outside would look to be highly successful, highly accomplished, were the same as any leader that we're dealing with like lots of issues around confidence, lots of issues around personal brand, lots of issues around how to network and how to strategically align yourself within your organization.

Kim Carlin:
So my boss in particular there really encouraged me to develop this kind of unique programming set. It was different from the more traditional management structure, the more framework academic scholarly research. So I used a lot of the work that I had done from consulting, what I learned about effective leadership style, about relationship developing from my consulting background versus the more academic slant to really help build this programming, which was quite unique actually in the Rotman experience, very good outcomes, we had really great feedback from the students.

Kim Carlin:
I think that it was highly successful. And even in my absence I have a number of people reaching out to me to find out more about those programs and how they can continue with the momentum that I generated from that. So I would say that was something that deviated from the straight and narrow of a typical academic environment. And we took a slightly different slant and she was very encouraging of me trying this new type of learning environment, which was very successful.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you think of a specific example from your consulting days where the leadership felt excluding? I want to talk a little bit about inclusion versus exclusion, how does that actually show up in leadership behavior? So we're busy these days, everything's about diversity and inclusion. And I just find that it shows up in certain leadership quality the feeling of being excluded or included. I want to hear what are your examples that you can think of, the difference for you about feeling included versus excluded?

Kim Carlin:
I think that some of the worst examples of exclusion were the public chastising and the public... The boss that I had was not stop short of publicly chastising you in front of a group, right? So the fear of that, if you are sitting around a boardroom table with a group of people, you hoped you weren't the one that was picked on, but that public chastising was one that certainly was live and well, it was unrelenting.

Kim Carlin:
So there was at times when he wouldn't let things go in terms of these public outcries of times when you perhaps made a mistake. In my own leadership practice now when I'm talking to leaders and talking to my own staff, it's really important for you to actually try something and fail. And if you fail, assuming it's not catastrophic, the most and important experience is what you learn from that.

Kim Carlin:
So what I feel from those public events being chastised is it meant that we were a very risk adverse culture. And it was, if the idea wasn't invented by the founding partners or the most senior members of the team, it wasn't well received. So as a result of that I think we became very myopic in our development. So we didn't have the level of creativity that you'd see in organizations the same level.

Kim Carlin:
So now that I've actually been outside of that environment, when I see the innovation, creativity and how other organizations have moved along the continuum of change and I look back and see how relatively stagnant we were from a methodology performance and outcome standpoint. I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that people were fearful. I guess I can't say other people, but people like me were fearful of truly changing status quo because of this fear of being publicly ridiculed in many ways.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, one of the things I keep noticing when I'm talking to people about the best boss ever is you learn a lot about the conversation ends up becoming a scale of what are the worst things that, not worst boss ever but maybe the worst practices ever versus the best boss ever practices. And so you end up learning a lot about the polarizing of those too.

Christine Laperriere:
So again, if you're fearful about putting innovative creative solutions on the table and we hear that as part of the cultural norm, the opposite of that again is going to be, here you are in an environment where somebody is really challenging and inviting that to the table and they're saying, "I want those creative, I ideas. I want you to take a risk. I want you to fail. I'm going to applaud your failures when you do." And for you, you're really seeing the difference between those two.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. 100%. And as you know Christine, consulting is a competitive environment. It's often an eat what you kill type environment. So rather than working in a collaborative fashion, what was encouraged in our environment was to be very highly competitive with each other. So as a result of that, we didn't have the cohesion of teamwork.

Kim Carlin:
So the public ridicule, the highly competitive environment, the real cutthroat environment, what that did to us was, make us not working I believe as strongly as a synergistic team, as we could have, which I believe now again, with hindsight being 2020, just the has better business outcomes, better superior record and better engagement.

Kim Carlin:
I stayed in this environment. Many people do stay in this environment, but I think we start to become more like those leaders and less like our true selves, which is problematic. And probably if I really dig deep, but I wasn't the kind of person I wanted to be when I was there. And I'm glad that I've had the ability to be able to recognize that in myself and pivot a little bit.

Christine Laperriere:
And then I have one last question for you, maybe a very personal question. You're in a same sex marriage or same sex relationship, and I just want to know, you obviously have interacted with so many different people in the business world. And I just know from our conversation offsite about the fact that in certain environments people would know that about you and in other environments you would hold back a little bit about your personal life. What is it about great leaders in general that would make you feel safe to share your full authentic self versus others? I'm just curious. Can you tell us a little bit about that?

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. Also a great question and one that I reflect on a lot. Obviously over the course of my career, it's been two decades so just society has changed and acceptance around same sex relationships has changed. So there's more openness to it today than there probably was when I started my career. I think that in general the people that... Again, it's the same people that encourage this inclusivity, that all voices at the table are the leaders that you can truly be your authentic self with.

Kim Carlin:
So if you're hiding an aspect of yourself of obviously gender or obviously race or disability, perhaps are more visible than your sexual orientation, but if you're not able to bring your whole self to the table, then you're limited in your ability, I believe to be creative, innovative and to be engaged. Now the interesting dichotomy to some of the things that I said around this highly competitive culture would make you think that that was one at which I would've been somewhat stifled in my sexual orientation, I would actually say it was quite the opposite.

Kim Carlin:
I was always encouraged to be true to who I was within the parameters of our business. But as I mentioned earlier in my career a large portion of my role was in a selling capacity, which meant that I was traveling around the world selling consulting services. And in a sales relationship, whether right or wrong, you are at the mercy of a client's decision on if they like you or not. People buy from individuals they like. And I was very careful and very guarded to be dishonest with who I was.

Kim Carlin:
I often played the gender game, talked about my partner. I actually would say husband versus a partner, certainly wasn't true to myself. But a big part at is really in the recognition that different environments you don't know what their feelings are around sexual orientation. So I think that in places that we went that would be more progressive, that would have policies around that, say financial service firms or maybe large healthcare institutions where there was prescribed policies around being open and diverse, but in many environments I wasn't being true to who I was.

Kim Carlin:
And I think it's a bit of the nature of the type of work that I did. Not saying it's right or wrong. Never was endorsed by the organization I worked for but I was self-imposed. But I'll tell you Christine now, again, being on the other side of this, being in an environment that's very highly supportive of people being completely true to themselves whatever their background is, it's just liberating and feels a lot easier just to go to work and not have to worry and look over my shoulder or play the gender pronoun game, which is just not fair to me or my partner.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, and I know just from having worked for that firm and having two leaders that were in same sex relationships. I always found it very refreshing because I felt the leadership... I just appreciated the diversity of leadership. I appreciated the fact you were the only female in the leadership team. And I guess that helped me feel like there was an opportunity for me in the future, but I also just appreciated the fact that not everybody was cut from the exact same cloth.

Christine Laperriere:
So like you said that was one of the good news part of that culture is that it did seem like they were inclusive on that front. For me, it gave the perception of the fact that you would be accepted regardless. So even if it was competitive and it had its own very specific cultural nature, just seeing some diversity in the actual people who were at the table to me always made me feel a little safer.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. I absolutely think so. And I know you and I are big proponents of having role models that we can look up to in organizations. I think that it's critically important. So I think that was always something that I felt of a strong, important burden on, not a burden in a negative way, but that it was important for me to represent myself appropriately as a female, as someone who is gay and certainly as an executive at the table.

Kim Carlin:
Either at my job now, or in other organizations that I've been part of, I think that it's important for me to represent myself appropriately because I do recognize that people will be looking up to me and looking to be... I don't want to say be like me, but certainly see a positive representation of someone from those types of communities.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And now you have the opportunity now to make other people see that it's possible and that they can be fully who they are without having to, like you said, edit their commentary or hold back a piece of who they are, or if you're at a dinner table with a bunch of clients not having to feel like you have to edit something about your personal life just to fit in, you have the opportunity set that stage where you... Like you said, you experienced your own editing along the way.

Kim Carlin:
That's right?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Kim Carlin:
That's right. There weren't a lot of role models for me 20 years ago. Lots of trailblazers were blazing paths in other industries, in our small firm that wasn't the case. But I'm proud to say that I was and certainly you were part of the trail blazing female group in that organization. And I think we've got a lot to be proud of.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And I wonder too just when I reflect upon what you're talking about, when I think of inclusion and how competitive that environment was. I wonder if the intense competitiveness about making sure that you always won the deal was part of what made you insecure about or made you feel like you needed to edit some parts. Because like you said that piece of just you didn't want to risk the deal over you being authentic.

Kim Carlin:
Yeah. I think that's absolutely it, right? And like I said no one ever told me to do that. I was never forced to do that but that intent competitiveness, the entire reward and compensation structure was predicated on you selling at all cost. So therefore you did everything, the good sales people did everything they could to put their best foot forward. And I made a judgment call that that's what it required for me. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt that perhaps there was lots of environments I didn't need to do that.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Kim Carlin:
But frankly, I felt I did and I had a very successful track record. I don't think it had anything to do with my sexual orientation one way or the other, I hope it had to do with my skill. But it wasn't a risk that at least at that stage I was willing to take-

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Kim Carlin:
Now, yeah, different but that's-

Christine Laperriere:
Well, let's hope that eventually the day comes when putting your best foot forward is that you can completely share all of those things and be, that is your best foot forward. But I completely understand what you're saying because a lot has shifted in 20 years around the perceptions and beliefs around this. Thank you so much for sharing so vulnerably, like I said, I knew I was going to challenge you with some tough questions. So I love-

Kim Carlin:
I wouldn't expect anything you ask Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. I love the fact that you let me go there and ask those questions and I do think people are going to get some great value out of hearing your stories and how your journey has unfolded and how you've learned about what that best boss ever looks like for you now that you move forward.

Kim Carlin:
Thanks. Thanks. Been fun being here. Thanks.
