Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the boss that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperrier.com, and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. So welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. And with me today, I have Bryan Shone. I'm so excited that you're here.

Bryan Shone:
Oh, it's great to be here. Thanks very much for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
Just for everybody's frame a reference, give me a little introduction on yourself so everyone knows who you are.

Bryan Shone:
Sure. Well, as you said, my name is Bryan Shone. I'm the executive director at Hamilton Children's Aid, and I've worked in the not-for-profit sector for 26 years now, working to support children and families in the community. And love what I'm doing and continue to enjoy leading in this field.

Christine Laperriere:
This was the reason why I really wanted you to be on the show. And I'm so glad that you decided to be a guest, because most of the people I interview on the show are in corporations or big companies, and your expertise being a non-for-profit, and also being a leader in that space. I'm just kind of curious, again, some of the themes are going to be similar, and I'm kind of curious where some might be different. But I think it's neat for people to get at a well-balanced point of view by hearing your leadership experience in that space.

Bryan Shone:
There are some things definitely that are similar, but there's probably some things that are a little bit different than in the corporate sector as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So tell us a little bit about who your best boss ever is.

Bryan Shone:
My best boss ever, really, I think when I was reflecting, really let me be who I was. So I was able to come to work authentically. One of the things that can be the same or a little different in the not for profit world is the passion for the work. When we get to work with children and families on a regular basis, that's something that you can really delve into and dive into. And my best boss definitely brought up the best in me by understanding what made me passionate and what helped to move me forward in my work.

Christine Laperriere:
How did they do that? I'm just curious. Did they ask good questions? Was it certain coaching? How did they find those things that were important to you?

Bryan Shone:
Yeah. When I think back on it, I think first and foremost, getting to know me as a person. So yes, getting to know me as an employee and what my role was and helping me to understand how I might work in the sector. But also getting to know me, what were my passions? Why was I doing this work? And what was it that I really wanted to accomplish? Not only did they encourage me to think about that, but then they also challenged me to do it. And then pushed me a little bit further than what I might even be comfortable in thinking about.

Bryan Shone:
So, as I was reflecting, I kind of thought, oftentimes, people are talking about the best bosses ever from the context of they were supportive, they were helpful. Sometimes it was uncomfortable. And when I look back on that, I feel like that was the time when the learning really happened. And when they were challenging me, it was also from a supportive perspective. So they were challenging me. They knew me well enough to know that I wanted to move forward, but also knew how far I was able to go in that moment and then continued to help me grow over time.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you describe a situation where you remember being a bit uncomfortable? I mean, as much as you can share?

Bryan Shone:
Certainly. I think one of the times that I was uncomfortable was in just, in the work that we do, a lot of what we're dealing with are our own biases, things that we might take for granted. But families and children that we serve come from different backgrounds, different cultures, different realities. And as a result of that, you always need to be very aware of where you're positioned in relation to, for instance, a family.

Bryan Shone:
And so sometimes, that becomes uncomfortable when you're thinking about a situation in a certain way and your best boss ever is saying, "Are you sure that it's ex actually that way? Give me a couple of other ideas of what it might be." And what was interesting is when I was doing that, when I was doing frontline work with families directly before I moved into management, it very much prepared me to then help and support those who I was working with when I became a manager, and ultimately, an executive director. I find to this day that I'm not necessarily doing a lot of telling people what to do, but I'm asking a lot of questions.

Bryan Shone:
And I think that's one of the things that my best boss ever did that I take with me to this day.

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic. What did you learn about yourself as you went through that experience working with that leader?

Bryan Shone:
The first thing that I learned was that I could do a lot more than I gave myself credit for at times. And secondly, that best boss ever really gave me an opportunity to do things that they were doing. So it almost moved me into the role of what they were doing before I actually got into that role. So it did a couple of things. One is it challenged me to think beyond what my current job was. But secondly, what it did was it gave me confidence that when I decided to move into that type of role, that I could do that role and made me a little more familiar with what that might look like, as well as test that out and see if that was something that was also for me.

Christine Laperriere:
And then can I ask you, given that your leadership, obviously, there's probably metrics and results that you work toward. When you work for a best boss under those... Your job is so interesting though, because it's definitely, the end game is much different than what some of us are facing in the business will world. So help me understand, what's the impact of having a great leader in your space versus the impact of working for a not great leader? What's the difference in outcome?

Bryan Shone:
I think first and foremost, the outcomes and metrics might be slightly different, but it's still important to have outcomes and metrics. When we talk about families and children that we serve, we're really talking about longer term outcomes. People being successful in their family lives as well as in their personal lives with our youth. One of the things that it taught me was, number one, that you need metrics and that you need to be always looking at the outcomes that you're trying to achieve.

Bryan Shone:
One of the things that they taught me really was to look at setting your intentions. I've learned how to do that over time and try and set my intentions now for our organization in a way that gets people excited and gets people engaged. I think that when I think about my not so best boss or bosses, I think what I'd more think about is that they were very much focused on the task, tended to unfortunately get into the weeds and perhaps, micromanage a little bit. At the end of the day, it sort of stripped away confidence rather than added to confidence.

Bryan Shone:
They were able to challenge. But the challenge without the excitement of, "You can do this," really becomes a weighing factor, I think, on your development. And so trying not to do that. The other piece that's interesting is that people talk about accountability as if it's a negative word. And I've really learned, I think over time, that that's not necessarily a negative word. Accountability is really about what helps to move us forward. And so when I'm talking about a best boss ever, and I'm talking about accountability, it's a little different than my not so best boss, in the sense that a sense of accountability is more about what you're not doing, as opposed to challenging you to be better at what you are doing. So that's kind of what I reflect on when I think about that juxtaposition.

Christine Laperriere:
The differences. And if you had to teach or advise future leaders on how to be wonderful leaders in your space, what would you encourage them to really focus on?

Bryan Shone:
Well, I think first and foremost, I would say engagement. So making sure that people have an opportunity to be part of the organization and part of the change that you're wanting to see within your leadership. The second piece would really be about how you continue to grow people and making sure that you know them well, making sure that you're interested in their wellbeing and that you also challenge them to continue to grow and to develop over time.

Christine Laperriere:
So I just wanted to ask you some questions about the type of work that you do, particularly that you're leading in. Like I said, such a unique environment where the outcome is based on families. It's on the benefit for families. First of all, I mean, you must have some hard days. What is that like?

Bryan Shone:
Oh, a hard day can be some pretty impactful pieces of work. Sometimes there are family situations that are quite challenging, sometimes there's dangers. So our focus is really on the safety of children and the care of their families. Some of those days can be really difficult. We're in a sector that really focuses a lot on compliance. There's a lot of stress that's associated for many of our staff around that.

Bryan Shone:
But I would also say that the other side of that is the ability to really make a difference and a change. And so many people don't know this. And when we talk about children's aid, we're often talking about children being removed or being taken away. I mean, most people don't realize that as an agency at Hamilton, we're now at 98% of families that are together that we're working with on a regular basis.

Bryan Shone:
And so it's about when you were talking about metrics a few minutes ago, it's about understanding those metrics from an outcomes perspective. We've been able to see a reduction in the last couple of years of about 20% to 25% of our children in care. And we've been able to keep them in the community. Now, we can't do that without strong community partnerships and really working together with all community organizations across Hamilton in order to do that.

Bryan Shone:
So our bad days are difficult, but we have more good days than we have bad days. It really is looking for those, those outcome long term. Recently, what we did is instead of looking at the compliance pieces, we really looked at a vision for the organization, which engaged our staff, engaged the community, and we're engaging families in that endeavor to move forward and to maybe change some of the perceptions that the child welfare has had in the past as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So when they're focused on a vision for the future then, tell me how that's a little bit different than being focused on compliance.

Bryan Shone:
There's lots and lots of things in child welfare that we need to focus on. Government metrics, looking at a number of different things. There's requirements that need to send in all of the time. And all of them are really related to how we provide service. So, how often we might see a family, or the type of planning we do with a family. And all of that is important, but I would suggest that it's really not enough, because the question that we still need to ask is why are all of those things important?

Bryan Shone:
So for instance, when you go and you see a family, that's the compliance piece. But what you do with the family when you're with them, that's really the outcomes piece. What does that look like? How are you adding value? How are you supporting that family to be able to be successful? Oftentimes, we're working with families that are disadvantaged in our communities. So struggling with poverty, there's been lots and lots of information, I think, in the community over the last little while about the impact of race, Black families, indigenous families, which are all overrepresented in child welfare.

Bryan Shone:
And so we really need to think about the outcomes that we're trying to achieve even more so than the standards. We need to look at those, but we also need to be thinking about what this looks like in the future state, as opposed to current statement.

Christine Laperriere:
That's very brilliant. I can see why that's a shift in perspective, because I even see that in the business world, where we're focused on process for the sake of process, but we're not actually thinking long term, what is the benefit or value or impact we're actually trying to make by following all these steps? So I can hear the correlation there where you're getting people out of the weeds and getting them to think, how do we really have meaning in the way that we interact with families?

Bryan Shone:
I think that depending on what you're doing in business, you're focusing largely on quantitative measures or quantitative outcomes, how much of something you've made in a certain period of time, or how many clients you've served and those types of things. Really, we need to be looking at the longer term and it's really that qualitative piece as well as the quantitative. So what does it look like to get feedback from our community and our families? When are we adding value to the work that's being done? How is that being defined?

Bryan Shone:
Well, that gets defined through our community here in Hamilton. And it also gets defined from the children, and the families, and youth that we serve. Really, what we're trying to do is we're focusing in six areas, but really the first two are service areas. One is to support children and families within the community and home through adding supports, early help and support, utilizing the assets of a family themselves.

Bryan Shone:
So one of the things that we recognize is that families that are isolated tend to have multiple challenges. And often, for anybody that's a parent, I say, "Imagine that you didn't have anybody when your kids were six months old. And what would that look like?" And imagine that you have housing insecurity challenges at the same time. You weren't sure where you were going to live and you're trying to navigate a system at the same time.

Bryan Shone:
Well, that's the kind of thing that many of our families are struggling with. And so it's trying to knit together that social safety net. So I often say that child welfare is really a safety net under a social safety net. Families that we may not be captured in the day to day services that you and I might hear about in our community. Oftentimes, it's us helping to support pulling them back up into that social safety net.

Christine Laperriere:
And you're right. I mean, I can only imagine, I was pivoting an entire business from in-person to virtual with a two and a four year old and being locked inside when they closed all the parks. That was the particular, my heart goes out to people, because you're right. I wasn't worried about whether the roof was going to be over our head. And that was the one thing that I could sleep at night knowing, but just trying to figure out how to keep up with everything was nothing I've ever experienced.

Bryan Shone:
One of the things that ended up working really well and we just tried our best because you're working through it in the same way that you're talking about in terms of a business and kids. But for so many of our staff, it was the same reality. And you've got staff that still need to go out and see families right as well in crisis type of situations. And so we tried to be as flexible as possible. Our work hours became really, really flexible. Working from home. We haven't gone back to, I'm at the office, but we haven't gone back to everyone being in the office because it's worked so well. Now, the challenge is almost on the other side now, which is, "All the kids are in bed and I have 20 minutes. I can go on, I can answer some emails," and that kind of thing. So we're trying to encourage people to put down the computer, close the computer from time to time, and have some away time as well.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's amazing that you understood that, because I feel like some leaders were not empathetic to how challenging it really was for people to literally run a full-time school while running a full-time career in any field. And like you said, I saw the burnout hit really hard, especially that third wave that we went through here in Canada, just the amount of burnout. And I know I felt it personally, but the people I was coaching were really next level. I've not seen anything quite like that. And then it must be challenging for your staff, because again, so they're at home with that challenge, but then their work life is also family challenge. So it's like they're pivoting from one version of family challenges at home to another version of family challenges at work.

Bryan Shone:
And in some situations, those challenges being similar. So you got a single parent. You're empathizing with some of the same things that are happening. And you're also trying to support and give advice. I mean, it is a little like some of your work around coaching. You're coaching a family through it and you're like, "Yeah. This is really hard for me as well." That creates some real opportunities, but it creates definitely some challenges where you feel like you can't away from it. Sometimes you might go, "Oh, I can go to work and get away from that just for a couple minutes or an hour," but they're going back into their families and then doing the same.

Christine Laperriere:
That's so interesting to me. You're right. I definitely had experiences where someone would be doing the same thing I'm doing at home and looking for coaching. And I almost want to just sit down with a box of Kleenex as I go. It's really hard.

Bryan Shone:
You're right.

Christine Laperriere:
You're right. I got no answers. It's just really bad. Any other pieces you want to add to this that you think would be interesting for people who are listening right now?

Bryan Shone:
If I was to give one piece of advice is when we talk about this change, sort of that outcome space piece, it's messy and it's not easy. And it's easier in some ways to be able to check off each of the pieces that you're doing. So for leaders that are, are moving through transformational efforts in your organizations, it's trying to maintain that focus for a longer period of time, but also suggest that from time to time, you're going to hit challenges. It's hard to paint the picture of where you want to go and to support people to get there. But I would say that it's completely worth it in the end, but that doesn't mean there aren't questions, there aren't people that are trying to understand what you're trying to do. And just to keep on keeping on, keep focusing on clarifying, supporting people through that process. And you'll get through to the other side of where you want to be.

Christine Laperriere:
So how has COVID of change the way that you lead, especially given probably the demand on your community during COVID?

Bryan Shone:
Well, the demand to our community during COVID is interesting, because I like to talk about early help and early support. And we've been trying very hard as part of our vision to provide early help and support so families don't end up in crisis. That has been a challenge during COVID, because lots and lots of services had to go virtual. Sometimes during COVID, families came to us, not so early. And as a result of that, families were sometimes in crisis. I think that that created some unique challenges for us and unique challenges for families as well. We've been working very closely with a number of community supports and working together as a community to try and solve some of those challenges. And we've been doing that really since COVID started.

Bryan Shone:
Some of the strengths though with COVID is the virtual perspective and having access to virtual services has also been helpful. So we've been able to connect sometimes with extended family members, we've been able to connect with families in a different kind of way. One of the things that we did early on is we realized that a number of our families struggled with technology. And as a result of that, we put some things in place so that families had the technology to be able to have conversations like you and I are having today through a virtual means.

Bryan Shone:
Our staff, I think, first and foremost, have done an amazing job. So unlike some other companies, we were an essential service. And so we worked face-to-face with families throughout this whole process. So definitely some challenges is around. What does that look like and how do we stay safe? We keep our community safe at the same time. I just can't say enough about the leadership team and the staff that serve families in our organization. They've been able to pivot and move through that in a really amazing way.

Bryan Shone:
And the waves of COVID were also a challenge, because sometimes, we were able to be out there more easily than in other times. We've kind of had to ebb and flow with the different waves. And that's definitely been a challenge, but we've been able to provide service all the way through. And that's in huge part to all of the work that people are doing here every day.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Bryan. This is fantastic. Again, I'm just so thankful that you came and shared your story and your insights with me.

Bryan Shone:
Great. Well thank you for having me. I really enjoyed myself.
