Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever Podcast. Today, I have Barry on the show. I'm so thankful that you're here today. Thank you so much.

Barry Danilowitz:
I'm delighted to be here, Christine. Thank you for inviting me.

Christine Laperriere:
Barry, can you tell everybody a little bit about yourself as we get started?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. So my name is Barry Danilowitz. I am currently the Vice President of Retail Product Distribution at Scotiabank. I've worked in the financial sector for probably half my career on the client side. The other half of my career, I actually worked in the software and hardware development industry.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I've sort of seen both sides of the table and had a great many wonderful bosses in the course of my career.

Christine Laperriere:
And I have to add here that I'm so excited you took time to do this podcast with me because I coach about 50 women a year at Scotiabank as part of this program that I lead, and I was telling one of the women one day about the Best Boss Ever Podcast. And she got so excited and she couldn't wait to tell me how you were her best boss ever, and so she just beamed. At one point I said, "I'll have to make sure we make time for coaching," because she was so excited to tell me about the impact that you had on her as a leader.

Christine Laperriere:
So we reached out to you, we asked you if you'd like to be on the show. And so, today this is exciting for me to get a chance to work with you.

Barry Danilowitz:
That's great to hear. Thank you for sharing. And she is a wonderful individual and I'm glad she shared that story. And I hope what I have to say today is helpful to others.

Christine Laperriere:
Can you tell me a little bit about your best boss ever, or your best bosses ever?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. Yeah, and this was a fun exercise to go back through my resume and look at my career and reflect back. And what struck me, the thing that came to mind, first of all, was a boss I had very early in my career when I was just starting out, working as a hands-on Technologist. And he had all the characteristics of a great boss, friendly, supportive, had a lot of trust, great feedback, et cetera.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I think I probably worked for him for maybe a year-and-a-half. And in one of our meetings, he said to me, "Barry, you don't have to do this job your entire career." And he proceeded to explain to me all the other things that I could do, and it was sort of two messages. One, it was, "FYI pal, there's a big world out there and you shouldn't think that somebody's going to tap you on the shoulder." And I think that's the important message that everybody needs to hear, that careers need to be built and they take work, and so that was great.

Barry Danilowitz:
The second thing was him explaining to me something that frankly, we assume people know, but how do you ever know unless anybody tells you that there's actually lots of opportunity for you and you should seek it out? And the third thing was, what he was sort of highlighting was that he wasn't just treating me as somebody that did stuff, but he actually paid attention to what I did and how I did it, and let me know of all the great opportunities that were available to me.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it was a very large organization, but I think the point is I remember going home. I can almost see it and thinking to myself, "Holy cow, I had no idea that there was a whole career available to me." And that was really, I think the start of my career, despite having worked for a few years, that I actually took on more and more leadership roles, and took building my career seriously.

Barry Danilowitz:
But if he'd never had that to me, I don't know that I ever would've. And I talk to a lot of less senior people in the organization and I try and get to the point of having that conversation. And it's remarkable to me, how many people go, "Wow. I didn't know that," and they probably would've stayed in the same job for most of their career without ever having benefited themselves from a more diverse career, but also having the organization benefit from all that they have to offer.

Christine Laperriere:
Now, on that note, I'm just thinking about so many people that I work with, and maybe they're not best bosses, would love it if they would just stay. If they're competent, they're doing a great job in that existing role, isn't it beneficial for them to just go, "Great. I have one last position I have to worry about?"

Barry Danilowitz:
Christine, you are raising a really great point, and I think what's behind a lot of people's resistance to having that conversation, to saying to somebody, "You're awesome, but you need to move on," is precisely the reason you've mentioned, is that you've got somebody great, they're a high performer. You don't have to worry about them. It's one less job that you have to fill, and it's one less interview cycle, new hiring cycle that you need to go through, which let's face it, is work.

Barry Danilowitz:
But I think as leaders, we have a responsibility to let awesome people know how awesome they are, and to encourage them to seek out more and better opportunities, and grow and develop their careers. Again, not just for them. I think we have a moral responsibility to do that for them, but also to the organizations that we support. We want to get the best out of the people in the organization, and keeping them in a corner somewhere, doing a great job, but never having the opportunity to flourish, really doesn't benefit the organization either.

Christine Laperriere:
I just have a thought, a kind of an aha moment while you're saying this. And I thought, is there something to the fact that sometimes the best bosses who know how to encourage somebody to fly, even if it's not immediately convenient for them, because they're going to have to fill that role and coach somebody new, but if they are a best boss, maybe they have confidence and they enjoy that development of new people into their team?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that's also a great point. I think best bosses are people who like people, and people who like taking the opportunity to bring out the best in people. And I think that if you are the kind of person who takes joy in coaching and mentoring, and helping people realize how much value they bring to the organization, doing it with the same person day in, day out, year in, year out, you're not really going to satisfy that desire, but an opportunity to meet somebody new and help somebody new, grow somebody new is a wonderful part of having the responsibility of leadership in an organization.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's an aha moment. I'm just thinking to myself, of how many times you hear a similar theme in that best boss ever, as different people have worked with different leaders. And it always surprises me that people would prefer to coach somebody new and keep moving people up through the organization even if it means a bit more work for them, but if they enjoy it, then it's not that much work, right?

Barry Danilowitz:
Yes, exactly. And you can never be perfect at it. I think that's the thing, is there's always an opportunity to be better and do better. And again, if you're doing it with the same person day in and day out, you're not really getting that opportunity.

Barry Danilowitz:
The other early boss I thought about was perhaps a little bit later in my career, and again, a great boss. I was very happy to work for him and supportive, and encouraging, and very happy to see me grow and flourish. But the one thing that he did for me, that nobody else had until that particular point in my career was we'd just finished a presentation to a fairly senior group and I said, "How do you think that went?" And he said, "Good, clear messaging, articulate. You kind of waffled in the middle there."

Barry Danilowitz:
And it was a really great example of two things. One, it was honest feedback and it was delivered in the moment. And I think everybody, or a lot of people talk about the value of feedback, but it's amazing, as I have taken it more and more seriously to give people feedback, how many people say to me, "Wow. Nobody's ever actually given me honest feedback." I've had lots of people say, "Good job." I've had lots of people say, "Well done," but I've never actually had somebody do me the courtesy and the respect of giving me open, honest, constructive, of course.

Barry Danilowitz:
There's better and worse ways to deliver it, but open, honest feedback, and I think you're demonstrating that you care about the person's career. You're demonstrating that you care about the person's development, but you're also respecting them as an individual because that kind of feedback is very, very personalized most of the time.

Barry Danilowitz:
And of course, it has to be delivered in the moment, but it just opened my eyes to the... It stung a little bit initially, but of course, afterwards, I thought about it and thought, "You know what? He's right. I was waffling. That's the truth of the matter." And now I'm trying very carefully not to be a waffler.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it reminded me of a great coach I had one time, who said... because again, I think a lot of people talk about giving feedback, but very few people actually do it. She said, "It's better to give somebody a bad day than a bad career." And every time I hesitate to give somebody feedback and I think, "Oh, is this going to sting too much? Is this fair?" I think those words resonate in my head and I think, "Better for me to let them hear it." Take it or leave it, but at least I'm being honest, and at least I'm giving them the opportunity to do better and grow better.

Christine Laperriere:
That is such a good quote, especially given that I was thinking while you were talking. I thought, "Oh man, you must have heard that though, and went home that night." How did you feel that night when you got that piece of feedback?

Barry Danilowitz:
Well, it was a little bit of a double edged sword. I thought it's done because I think that presenting is one of the things I like to do. As part of a job, I like mentoring people and I like presenting. And so it hurt, but I played back the presentation in my mind, and I looked at the PowerPoint, and I thought, "You know what? There's definitely an opportunity for me to be a little crisper in my messaging, and not get too interested in the chatter, and not be too enthusiastic about showing how clever I am because that's not why we're here. And I'm not that clever. The point of this exercise is for me to quickly and efficiently get information across, and you know what? I didn't."

Christine Laperriere:
It's funny that you say that, because I immediately started thinking of some candid feedback that I was given throughout my career, and how transformative it really was to have a leader give me not just the, "Oh great job," but actually say, "You know what? Here's your opportunity." Those last with you. Those messages, they do make you better.

Barry Danilowitz:
They do, and they're rare, and there's no perfect person and no perfect employee. And unless somebody provides you that feedback, how are you going to know?

Christine Laperriere:
And then any other leaders that come to mind as you're thinking through this?

Barry Danilowitz:
Sure. A more recent leader I have had did a really interesting thing. Now, of course, in COVID times it's a little bit different, but whenever we met for a one-on-one, he always made a bit of a show of turning off his cell phone and turning it over, and putting it aside. It was his way of saying, "I am present. I am listening to you right now."

Barry Danilowitz:
And it's so important for leaders to be present, to listen carefully to what people are saying and what they're not saying, and to demonstrate that you care and you're interested. And it was a simple gesture, and I know it was hard to do. He's a very busy guy. It was a small gesture, but a very powerful one to demonstrate that, again, that he was interested, and that he cared, and that he was present. And being present in a one-on-one with somebody who you are responsible for managing is such an important part of the leadership experience.

Barry Danilowitz:
Now, of course, in COVID times, there're other ways you can do it. You can sit with your hands crossed on the screen and then clearly, you're not typing or looking at your phone. There're ways around it, but I thought it was quite a powerful gesture.

Christine Laperriere:
I really like that. I feel like there're leaders that I work with that you benefit from that thinking about how's the ritual that you're going to use, that's going to really demonstrate your fullest attention as being given to somebody.

Barry Danilowitz:
Yes, everybody, all humans have a basic needs to be heard and seen and respected, and everybody understands that their leaders are busy, but it's so important to give people the time to listen to what they're saying, to listen to what they're not saying, if you really want to bring out the best in them.

Barry Danilowitz:
And that means being present and turning off your phone, and not looking at it or whatever else is going on your screen is a great way to convey that message.

Christine Laperriere:
It really demonstrates your commitment to them in that moment. That's excellent. Do you have any other stories or things that you were thinking about that you feel like you want to add to this?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think the one other thing that, that leader that I mentioned recently does is I think as part of leaders, a little bit of your job is to listen to people complain. It's inevitable and I always say, "Look, I'm happy to listen to your complaint, that's part of my job. My job is to help you, and if you need to vent, I'm here for you." And he does that and he did that, but I think the other interesting thing I did is he always presents the other side of the story, and there are always two sides to every story.

Barry Danilowitz:
I think we know that in the back of our minds, but he makes a very conscious effort of saying, "Well, maybe think about what this person is actually trying to do." And I think it does two things. It balances the thought by providing a little more context, because I think we all get very heads down and involved in what we do in our work. And we forget about how the work that we do exists in a much larger context, but it also serves as a good reminder that the work that you're doing is actually important as in, okay, you may be frustrated with this person, but remember, you're doing this thing to help this person with this other thing. And they have this other responsibility to these other people.

Barry Danilowitz:
And especially in a large organization where sometimes you feel like a little cog in a very big wheel. It's important to remind people that the work that they do is important, the work that they do matters, the work that they do has an impact to the larger organization and lots of other people because I think, again, is we have a little bit of a tendency to be a little bit inwardly focused, and he's really great at setting the larger stage, setting the larger context.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and that would be a powerful engagement tool. That would be really powerful because again, once it brings you back to what your bigger purpose is and how you're impacting things at a broader level that you can't see or remember sometimes, it would kind of fire you back up again, right?

Barry Danilowitz:
Absolutely, and I think it's interesting in our employee engagement survey, one of the questions goes something like, "Do you understand the connection of your work to the larger value of the organization?" I'm getting the words wrong, but the sentiment is something like that. And I put a lot of work into having that conversation with my direct reports and their direct reports, and so on, because I think especially as Technologists, you sort of forget the value of the work that you do and how it impacts your business partners, and the customers, and the stockholders, and all of the other people in the organization. It's often not obvious to people, how the work that they do connects.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I pay very careful attention to that score because it's surprising how often... People will do a great job, but you ask them why the work that they do is important to the larger organization, they often don't actually understand. And when you take the time to explain it to them, it has a very enthusing and empowering effect on people because they really understand why the work that they do is important. And the work that everybody does is important, but it's really important to make sure that people understand that.

Christine Laperriere:
And they remember it when they are frustrated. So I have a question for you, when you think of having worked for probably varying ranges, from a best boss, all the way down to maybe not a best boss. When you think of the impact to the bottom line, the difference between working for a best boss versus not, what's the impact to the business?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think the impact comes in many forms. Sometimes it's obvious in terms of increased cost or lost productivity. And maybe I'm a little bit biased here. I find in technology, you often meet incredibly smart people, like incredibly smart people, but if they don't understand... Again, if they don't understand the value of the work that they do, their level of engagement, the amount of effort that they're going to put into solving a problem is not going to be at the level that you need it.

Barry Danilowitz:
And if you want to get those really big brains fired up around solving problems, making things more efficient, delivering products more quickly, finding ways to do things more cheaply, if they're not in engaged and enthused, you're just not going to see the productivity and you're not going to see the engagement.

Barry Danilowitz:
And the thing is, I can't remember the expression, something about one bad apple, one bad apple spoils the batch or something. If you have one person in your team who has a bad attitude, it can pervade and poison the entire team. And it may be a very good person who just maybe doesn't understand the importance of the work that they're doing, or don't understand why they're being asked to do work in a certain way. And then it brings down their productivity, but also the entire team's productivity, and there's a cascading effect.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I think if people... I always think of the four Es, are people engaged, empowered, enthused, and enabled? And unless people have all those four things going on, the hits to the productivity of their team and their organization, and anybody else who they deals with, can have a real impact on the bottom line.

Christine Laperriere:
So now, being that you've been named best boss ever by one of your employees, can I ask you, what do you do when you have a bad apple though? Sure, you can inspire and coach, but just help me understand, how do you deal with that problem?

Barry Danilowitz:
It's not easy and it takes a lot of time. I think first and foremost is recognizing our common in humanity, and I think people often forget about that. They get too wrapped up in their position and how high they are in the organization, or not high they are in the organization, and don't always take the time to really understand a person and get to know a person.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I always like to start with just a human connection. You know what? You've got to find common ground with the person, don't talk about work. The obvious one is, "How is your weekend?" But really dig into the, "How is your weekend?" Not, "It was good." "Really? What did you do? Oh, okay. You went hiking. Where did you go hiking? Tell me more about the hike?" And just start by trying to build trust, which you do by building a bond, some commonality, and trying to find a way to connect on a very, very human level.

Barry Danilowitz:
And I think once people trust you, you get a little bit of a sense of why it is that they are frustrated. And sometimes it's something personal that they are not obliged to share, but you may get a little bit of a sense that there's something going on at home that's making life difficult for them.

Barry Danilowitz:
And often, you can help. Maybe they're shy to say, "Look, I really need to take every Friday afternoon off to take care of my sick mother," or something that they're perhaps not comfortable sharing. Getting to have that conversation and finding a way to say, "You know what? It's okay. I'm going to give you the time off because you are valued and valuable, and I want to bring out the best in you."

Barry Danilowitz:
The other thing is you may actually find out that they don't like another team member. And again, that's not something people are readily going to admit to, but if you develop that trust relationship and say, "Look, I'm not going to tell, but you're clearly unhappy. What's going on? And I care. I care to know why it is that you're unhappy."

Barry Danilowitz:
Or the other interesting one is sometimes they just don't buy the project. They don't understand why they're doing what they're being asked to do, and all too often, we ask people to do things without taking the time to explain to them why it's important. And sometimes you can have a real transformative conversation with somebody to say, "Look, I know this might seem like an overly complicated project, or maybe you don't understand the product, but here's why this is important to our business partner."

Barry Danilowitz:
And there can be a real light going on, and let's face it, when you give somebody a project assignment, we don't always spend perhaps enough time as we should explaining the wheres and the whys, and the why fors, but sometimes it can really make a difference to people. So it's worth exploring, "Do you understand why you're being asked to do what you're you're doing?"

Barry Danilowitz:
And then the other one is sometimes, and this is always so sad, you come across people who are just in the wrong job. All right. They've been bumped around or they got assigned this, or somebody left and they were asked to do that. And so, they've continued doing it for the last three or four months, or years, and they're just in the wrong job. And it's the responsibility of the leader to find out what it is that they're more interested in, and get them doing something that is actually interesting to them, and that comes to the, are they engaged and enthused?

Barry Danilowitz:
If people aren't engaged and enthused, they're not going to do a good job, and nor would I expect them to.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that is excellent. And that point about a wrong job, I think of my own detour into marketing, which I'm not meant to be in marketing. I've found out, but I didn't work with anybody in that moment who was able to go, "You were extremely successful in these three roles, and then you ended up in a role that wasn't..." It wasn't about success so much as it was, "You weren't happy anymore. You didn't have the enthusiasm." It was one of the four years that you mentioned, but it changed, something shifted because that was not the same.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, I think that point about the wrong job, I see that unfortunately in bigger organizations where people get promoted and they move and they move. And then all of a sudden, they end up in a position where they're just like, "This isn't my happy place. I was so successful, and now I ended up here."

Christine Laperriere:
Sometimes they just leave the organization because they feel at this point that their leader is not... they're not looking for that next job for them though. They're not looking for what would be more exciting for them.

Barry Danilowitz:
Which is so unfortunate, because in many cases, they're really good people with a lot to offer. People say, "You should find your jam or find your bliss," and you should, but your leader has a responsibility to make sure that you are engaged and enthused, and sometimes asking a couple of probing questions to get to that point. And you can't always solve it right away, but at least, "Okay, let's acknowledge that this is not the best fit for you. There are many other wonderful things that you can do for the organization. I can't make a change right now, but let's work towards it together." And just that alone can have a difference for people.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, yeah. And a great leader can observe what that person is strong at. So when you are in the wrong job, you're not feeling very strong, but a great leader can say, "I do see your capability here, your capability there." And so they can even help provide the advocacy for what you're great at.

Barry Danilowitz:
Yeah, exactly. But it has to be a conversation and somebody has to care enough to have the conversation.

Christine Laperriere:
And I think that's the essence of some of the things I keep hearing, and the way that you're explaining those best bosses, is that they cared enough. They kept coming back to, "I care about you enough that I'm willing to have the hard conversation. I'm willing to talk about the tough feedback, or I'm willing to talk your way through a wrong job, but I care enough about you, that I'm going to help you get through that next step."

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that's exactly right.

Christine Laperriere:
So I have one question for you as well. When you think of a not great boss, what's the difference in approach that creates that, or at least in your experience?

Barry Danilowitz:
I think two things come to mind. One is it's important for leaders to remember that they set the tone. And when I think of a boss who wasn't great, super smart guy, I definitely learned a lot, probably how to be more Machiavellian than not, maybe not a great skill. But the thing that I recall is a very sour attitude that pervaded the entire team, and it's important to remember to set the tone from the top.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it doesn't matter where you are in the organization. If you have people reporting to you, you have a responsibility to set a positive, productive tone, and everybody in the team had that attitude. And I've noticed as I encounter teams where there's a little bit of a negative attitude, nine times out of 10, whoever leads that team has a negative attitude, because people hire in their own image, but people also take their cue about how to behave from their boss.

Barry Danilowitz:
And so, I think when I think about what was bad about that situation was a very negative attitude that included making disparaging comments about others. And I thought, "Well, if he's making disparaging comments about others, what kind of comments is he making about me or the rest of the team?"

Barry Danilowitz:
It creates an unease, and perhaps a little bit of distrust, and words are powerful and words matter. And as leaders, you have a responsibility to set the right tone.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, that makes so much sense to me. And those, like you said, the remarks you make about other people, sometimes leaders think that, that's a way of bonding, but ironically, it's actually extremely the opposite. It usually just creates like a massive amount of distrust. When they walk out of the room, it's like, "Now what's being said about me?"

Christine Laperriere:
I obviously work with a lot of leaders who are on their way or aspiring to be best bosses ever. So I just have any tips, wisdom, what would you really encourage people to think about or focus on as they're aspiring to be fantastic?

Barry Danilowitz:
I have a sticky in front of me on the four E's I mentioned. Is everybody engaged? Do they understand the value of what they're doing? Do they understand the value of what they're doing to the larger organization? So are they engaged? Are they empowered? Do they know that I trust them? Do they know that they have the right to make decisions? Do they know that I have them on the team because I think they're awesome? Does everybody understand that? Are they enthused? Do they care about the work that they're doing? Are they in the right job? Are they working well with the rest of the team?

Barry Danilowitz:
Finally, enabled, which is a very simple one, but do they have a computer that works? The number of times people say, "Oh, my laptop keeps crashing." Get a new one, but people are shy or they don't want to ask, or they think it's a problem. And I think simple things like that makes a really big difference.

Barry Danilowitz:
I think that have the courage to provide the honest feedback. It's so hard, but you'll just be astonished at how much people appreciate somebody taking the time to give them honest feedback, and it needs to be delivered in the right way and sensitively. But even if it's going to sting, just remember that it's better to give somebody a bad day than a bad career.

Barry Danilowitz:
And it's remarkable how often people will say, "Gosh, nobody's ever given me that kind of feedback before." Remember your impact. Remember that words matter and words are powerful, but also remember the great quote from Maya Angelou, "People may not remember what you say, but they will certainly remember how you made them feel." And that I think goes to the point of setting a positive tone. Even in a difficult situation, you can set a positive tone, but remember that as a leader, your team is looking to you and will take their cue from you, how to treat others and how they perceive their value is going to be very much reflection of how you talk to them.

Barry Danilowitz:
So take the time to get to know people. There are so many wonderfully interesting, super, super smart people out there, that if you just take the time to get to know them a little bit better, first of all, you'll learn something, but also, it's a way to get the best out of people. I always say most of the people that work for me will forget more than I'll ever know, but at least I can find a way to get them to deliver the value that they have to the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
When you think of getting to know people, I can just feel how that's a strength of yours, do you have any kind of tactical tips too? Just when you think of some people are more introverted and it's not as intuitive, or maybe they're working with a team that's a little more closed off, maybe from a previous leader. Help me think of how do you get there?

Barry Danilowitz:
It's a hard one because you're right. A lot of people are shy and a lot of people aren't used to leaders engaging on that level. I think I'll go back to what I said earlier, remember your common humanity. We may be at different levels in the organization and we do what we do at different kinds of organizations, but the end of the day, we're all human beings and we all have the same needs and desires, wishes, hopes, dreams, and fears, and just starting, going in with that recognition and asking questions, again, "Wow was your weekend?" "Good." "Why? What did you do this weekend?"

Barry Danilowitz:
Or, "Do you have any vacation plans? Or have you read any good books lately?" "No, I haven't written. I don't read." "Okay. What do you do?" "I like to watch TV." "What's your favorite TV...?" There are a 1,000,000 questions that you can ask, and the question isn't the important thing, right? It's what you learn about people's interests. What they like, what they don't like. There's always another question you can ask.

Barry Danilowitz:
I'm not a huge sports fan, and so I'm always challenged when people say, "Oh, I went to a ball game." "Okay. Who played? Where did they play? How are they doing in the league?" The fact that you're asking the questions, you'll get through the basic questions, but very quickly, you'll get to a very human conversation where you're going to find something in common, and you start there, and it only gets better from there.

Barry Danilowitz:

Christine Laperriere:
I think that is a great reminder for everybody out there listening, and in the world of COVID and now us working on Zoom, I know we have to be even more intentional sometimes about what you're talking about, where you have to make the time because we get onto our Zoom calls and it's like, we know the agenda of the meeting, tick, tock, let's go.

Barry Danilowitz:
Absolutely. Absolutely. Again, we can't forget our common humanity and it's a starting place for all great relationships and communication.
