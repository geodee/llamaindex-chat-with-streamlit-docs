Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, President of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christineaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the show, Cam. I'm so excited that you decided to be a guest for me. You and I have worked together for years now, actually, at different organizations. And one of the of reasons that I thought you would make a fantastic guest is that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you over the years. You are one of the most collaborative, just easy to get along with people that I've ever worked with. And I've always seen that in your leadership. So I really admire you and I couldn't help but be excited to invite you on the show. Welcome.

Cam Haygarth:
Thank you so much, Christine. Happy to be here.

Christine Laperriere:
And just really quick, as we get started, tell people your official title and role today.

Cam Haygarth:
Sure. Today I'm Vice President Marketing and Sales for SureShot Solutions. And if you want to know what SureShot solutions are, that's when you and go order a double-double, where the equipment that accurately dispenses whether it be the cream or the sugar, or the sweetener, or the milk. So that's what we do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Home of the double-double. So few people know that. SureShot's the one that makes that happen.

Christine Laperriere:
So then I'm going to dive right in and I'm going to ask you. I'm so curious, given how I've seen you lead, who comes to mind when I talk of who might be your best boss ever?

Cam Haygarth:
I've been fortunate to say I think I've had three best bosses ever, Christine. And I think I've been around long enough. I've been working for over 30 years now, hard to believe, but you really, really appreciate the good ones because they're, unfortunately, not as common as the rest, if you will. And so I've been fortunate enough to this point in my career have had three fantastic best bosses ever.

Christine Laperriere:
Great. And then, can you share some stories and some insights that you've learned from watching them?

Cam Haygarth:
Sure. The first gentleman, in this case, was early in my career. So I went to business school at Western, graduated, joined Coca-Cola bottler and in Southwestern Ontario in Kitchener. After about a year, I got moved to Sarnia, promoted to Sarnia. The VP for our region, gentleman named Don Mitchell, older gentleman, certainly older at the time. I was early twenties, he was probably in his fifties. Wait a minute. I'm in my fifties now. That's not good. That's not good. He was one of the hiring. He made the final decision on my hire. So I'm potentially a little biased, but just his vision, his communication skills. And with all three of my best bosses ever, just a sincere concern for you as a person, not only as somebody that works on his or her team, but as a person in your development, in your wellbeing.

Cam Haygarth:
And just a little story. An aside, he called me one, I think it was a Thursday evening, and he said, "Cam, I'm supposed to go to the NHL All Star game this weekend in Philadelphia." this is back when we did these type of things, "And I can't go, I have a family commitment. I'd like you to go with my tickets." So got to go to the airport, fly to Philadelphia, go to all these VIP events. Back then, it was a big deal. This was 1993 in Philadelphia. The reason I'm telling you this story, Christine, is, his son had a minor car accident a few weeks before. And I'm in Sarnia. People know Sarnia is down by not far from Detroit Windsor, and I've got to go to Toronto to the airport. And I had a company car, Coca-Cola bottler company car. And he said, "Cam, it's calling for snow tomorrow. I want you to rent a bigger, safer car to drive to the airport in Toronto, just so that you get there for sure. And you get there safe."

Cam Haygarth:
And so that is just one of many examples of just the type of person he was. And in all three cases, Christine, these people, you want to work hard for them, you want to make them proud of you. You want to do whatever you can, whatever it's physically possible to help them win because they care so much about you. And it's sincere. It's not the politician sincere. It's real.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. It's so interesting to hear that, Cam, because that is one of the qualities I see in you. I really feel like you have always demonstrated that from the first time that I met you. When, again, you didn't know anything about me and you just took a genuine interest in, "Who is this person in front of me, can I genuinely get to know them?" And then just your natural attention on the wellbeing of the person first and then doing business second, which to your point has always made me really want to make sure that you're a happy customer when I'm working with you, just because that sincerity comes across, right? Do you think that you got that trait from seeing that behavior and then trying to mirror that?

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah, I believe. I don't know if I got it, but I certainly was able to hone something there by mirroring and kind of watching his style learning. He was the type of guy who could give somebody crap without raising his voice, without swearing, without being disrespectful. Just a couple well-placed comments, words, and the message was clear. And I like to think that I took some things from him, that I've been able to use through the remainder of my career to this point.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. And what about the second boss?

Cam Haygarth:
Second boss was Vince Tim [inaudible 00:06:44]. I worked my way up through the bottling system at Coke, and then had the opportunity to jump over to the company side. So there's the company who have all the money and do the market. And then there's the bottler who does all the delivering, all the heavy work and has all the debt. And I moved to the company side and got promoted to Vice President of Food Service and Hospitality business unit. And my boss was the president Vince Tim [inaudible 00:07:13]. And much of the later years on the bottling side was working for command and control-type leaders. And when times were tough, when things weren't going well, they got louder and yelled more, and demanded more, and pushed more, and threatened more. And I came to work for this gentleman, Vince Tim [inaudible 00:07:39].

Cam Haygarth:
And we were in some tough times, but just seeing how he reacted in tough times and did not lash out, but actually brought people together. And his style, his ability to create a vision, build strategy, execute against it, and his communication skills were incredible. And so I just learned a lot, and that's another consistent theme through all three leaders is, it's not when times are good when you see and you learn, it's when times are tough that you know the good ones really shine through.

Christine Laperriere:
That makes a lot of sense to me. And I mean, I can think of, we're in the middle of a pandemic right now, so there's lots of businesses, organizations all over the place that we're seeing what leaders are made of right now. We're in those tough times for a lot of businesses. So I'm just curious when you're talking about his reaction and tough times, can you just give us maybe even a descriptor or an example of when you specifically remember watching his reaction and being surprised?

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. I think we would get on calls that our executive team would get on a call with our leadership in Atlanta every once a month, generally. And Atlanta at that time, the leadership style was different. It's changed over the years, but it was a little more of that command and control. And so if our numbers weren't where they wanted them to be, there'd be a lot of drilling down, a lot of challenging, a lot of those type of things, and particularly how we're dealing. We were leading the bottler from a franchise or perspective. Those calls could get pretty dark and pretty rough on the members of the executive team here in Canada.

Cam Haygarth:
But Vince could have easily, many times turned to us, to me, as an example of food service, "Why aren't your numbers better?" But he wouldn't... Very often he'd take it himself and he'd push back very often. And very respectfully, again, always respectfully, but he wouldn't just assume things were the way they were and that things had to be that way. He would respectfully push back and challenge back. And just the way he did that, Christine, was new to me at the time. I've since learned that there's a whole world out there with leaders like him, but at the time it was so new to me, so refreshing and so liberating in many ways in terms of the way I thought and the way I led, to be honest.

Christine Laperriere:
So he really had your back, is the impression I'm getting.

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly. And intellectually, you have to perform, you have to drive the results, all those good things, but it wasn't an "Either or", it was, "Okay. When things aren't great, we'll work our way through this and work together on it." So it wasn't just throwing somebody overboard right when things started turning south.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. I think that is one of those things that's, again, kind of easy to say and harder to do as far as the instinct to blame, the instinct to hunt for the fault in another person, that trait shows up again when times are tough and people are under pressure. Someone who can stay calm and collected and, again, rally for their people and rally for the integrity of the work that's getting done. I can see how he would end up on your top-three list.

Cam Haygarth:
For sure.

Christine Laperriere:
That's great. Then I'm of course curious to know, I want to hear about the third.

Cam Haygarth:
Well, the third one, you know well, he's my current president, David Macaulay, and you of course introduced me to David and the SureShot Organization several years ago now. And I think aspects of both gentlemen and David, both the first two people I spoke of, the caring understanding side, and this might be part of that Eastern culture down, based in Nova Scotia. But just that, wanting to make sure you're okay, wanting to make sure things are going well in your life, not just work, work, work. And then dealing in tough times, as you mentioned COVID. And our business being in the equipment world, when things slow down, first thing people stop buying is things that they can delay if possible. And equipment very much falls into that category, especially our equipment, which seems to go on forever and ever, which is hard when you're in sales.

Cam Haygarth:
But we hit a real wall back in March and things ground to a halt. And tough times, and fortunately we have a very strong balance sheet, but David is trying to drive results for the shareholders and the stakeholders and, "What do you do?" and, "How do you deal with it?" And he always was calm, cool, collected, was quite open with the organization in terms of communicating where we were, what we were doing and just explaining that things were uncertain, but here's what we are doing. Here's what we can do.

Cam Haygarth:
And always trying to balance the three things, the wellbeing of the business, the wellbeing of our people and the wellbeing of our customers. And trying, not just in the short term, but in the long term. And we did have to do some very difficult things. We had to eventually restructure to a certain degree, but we're now coming out the other end. And I think we're in a great place. And it's because of the leadership communication style and just the ability to relate with our team, with our entire organization on a personal level, very powerful.

Christine Laperriere:
And, just again, it speaks volumes to when you put your people first and you make that investment, like you said, balancing the business between the customers and the people. I think that trifecta right there really does describe... It comes across somehow. I mean, I can even think of my own example of working with David, where I suffered a concussion. And I reached out to him and said, "I can't work for you right now." Obviously I was doing lots of sales strategy work. And I said, "Unfortunately, I have to take...", I think it was 12 weeks off, because I suffered a major concussion while I was working for him. And it was so interesting because the first thing that he said was, "If you need us to pay your invoice, don't worry about it. Just go ahead and bill us." And he was more... Genuinely, his first response was to try to make sure that I had enough money to survive versus his concern.

Christine Laperriere:
In the back of my head, I was thinking, "Oh, they're probably going to end their engagement with me. Three months is going to go by and they're going to hire somebody else." And just that feeling of dread a little bit. But his first concern was making sure that I had some financial stability while I had just suffered this accident. So I will never forget that. When somebody does that, you don't ever forget it. It leaves a mark. That response was so much more powerful than some of the other ones that I received.

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. He just has that. David drives for results and he is detailed-driven, he's focused, but he has that wonderful human touch and that ability to see beyond just the numbers and beyond just the business and understand... People development is such a huge part of our strategy as well. And trying to bring people along, see them progress. And in instances like yours, that's where you just see his big heart, just the way he approaches life in general and people in our organization.

Christine Laperriere:
I always... It's so interesting when you say that because I've really come to this conclusion because I do so much work in the leadership space and I'm always talking about the business case. And everybody struggles with soft skills because they struggle to see you the direct link to the bottom line. So this is part of my passion for this topic right now, is trying to understand really what is the impact of a best boss. And I think of that example with David and all I can say is that when anytime that he needed something, again, if I could figure out how to go the extra mile, I would go the extra mile just because it felt like it would be reciprocated when I needed it.

Cam Haygarth:
That's bang on, Christine. Exactly. All three of these individuals, you want to make them proud, you want to do whatever you can to help them succeed in business, in life. Anything I could do for them business or personal I would do just because of the way they've treated me and treated people in the organization. And you know how much work is part of our life. Those are the type of people like your mother, your father, you want to make them proud and you want to do whatever you can for them. So, definitely.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. And then just for compare and contrast, have you ever had a not best boss ever, someone who would not make the list? And maybe you don't have to call them out necessarily by name, but mostly the characteristics or traits that stand out as being the most polarizing for you, or the ones where you just said, "I got to get out of here as fast as I can."

Cam Haygarth:
Yeah. Senior level back on the bottler side. Command and control with disrespect, I would say, or with a lack of respect. And the impact that had on people in the organization, on the team. And it would create, just as good, strong values and attributes can transcend and can permeate the entire organization, so can disrespect some of those negative elements, they can, especially when it's coming from a senior level, it can permeate the organization.

Cam Haygarth:
And I saw that and I saw how it damaged good people who had to eventually exit, and then how it turned some people with good potential almost to the dark side in terms of where they gravitated, how they responded and reacted. And, fortunately, again, in my career, I haven't had too much of that, but there's been enough, very, very different, just two different ends of the spectrum, for sure, in my opinion.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I mean, I just love that you're bringing that point up, and I think it's a really great spot to pull it to close, which is, in my impression, what I find is that people mirror each other. That is what culture is. And so culture is always this. Again, it's hard to describe how do you invest in the culture of a business because it's not a tangible thing, does it actually impact the bottom line? It's really hard to prove a lot of the times because it's so subtle, but when you say that, I mean, I think of you explaining your best bosses ever, and how much of that shows up in the way that you lead and you interact with people, and then meanwhile to your exact point.

Christine Laperriere:
And I've seen it too, the disrespectful behavior. It's catchy because people start to say, "Well, that's got to be what I need to do to get noticed around here." And imagine when you start to have an organization that fills up with disrespectful people who are in that control-and-command style of leadership. I mean, you're not having the response that you and I just had where we said, "We'll do triple back flips because we want to make you proud." That goes away. You're like, "I will do the minimum amount to just stay off of your radar."

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Even if you're a top performer, it's hard to bring your A-game to someone who could be disrespectful.

Cam Haygarth:
And they say winning drives culture, but often you can't win right away. And sometimes you have to take when the times are tough or the situation is such that you're going to lose a few games before you start winning. And it's how you treat each other in those tough times that really helps pull you out and take you to a better place in the future.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Cam Haygarth:
And that's what, in my mind, builds that culture.

Christine Laperriere:
And you teach other people exactly how to respond to a tough time by the way you lead.

Cam Haygarth:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Well, thank you, Cam. This was fantastic. And I know for a fact that there are people listening that can resonate with your story, for sure.

Cam Haygarth:
Thanks so much for the opportunity, Christine. Appreciate it.
