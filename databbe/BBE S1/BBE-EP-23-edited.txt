Host: Jenelu Payne
Guest: Christine Laperriere

Jenelu Payne:
Hey everyone. Welcome back to the Generational Wealth Summit. And today we have Miss Christine Laperriere and she is the president of Leader In Motion, an organization focused on developing high-potential leadership talent with special expertise supporting women in leadership. She authored a number one Amazon best seller title called Too Busy to Be Happy: A Guide to Using Emotional Real Estate to Grow Your Work-Life-Wisdom. Parentrepreneurs, please welcome the one and only Christine Laperriere.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you so much. That was an awesome intro.

Jenelu Payne:
I really love the topic for today and the topic is the best wealth practices for parents, business and family. And I know that you are the perfect person for this topic, and I am just so excited to have you with us.

Christine Laperriere:
Looking forward to it.

Jenelu Payne:
So many entrepreneurs feel like if they ever stop to take a break, they will lose money. Where do you think this belief comes from?

Christine Laperriere:
There are so many layers to why I think this happens, but the first one that I think, I call it two-dimensional thinking about time. So we think of time equaling money, and we're kind of taught that from an early age, because we take hourly jobs where time equals money. In all fairness, many of us, as entrepreneurs, immediately think to ourselves, "Well, if we want to make double or triple what we just made in our hourly job, we're going to have to work double or triple the hours." And we sign up for it because we get into businesses we're passionate about, and we love that opportunity to create. So it's a little bit of wiring and DNA mixed with a little bit of what I'll call failed logic on the physics of how we create money.

Jenelu Payne:
Now, what is the tangible result of this way of thinking?

Christine Laperriere:
Obviously, there can be some great results, because we know some entrepreneurs who have created just amazing things and changed the world. And so there's obviously some good to it. But on the flip side, I think, as a apparent entrepreneur, and even prior to that burnout, is the thing that so many of us face. It's interesting when I think about it, my brother is a musician and was always scared to become an entrepreneur musician, for fear of falling out of love with something that he was so in love with.

Jenelu Payne:
Wow.

Christine Laperriere:
So I think about it and I go, burnout's definitely the number one challenge, but the fear of falling out of love was something that drove us to want to be entrepreneurs in the first place. I think that's scary.

Jenelu Payne:
You're right. It's definitely scary. It really is. And you know what? A lot of times, us, as parents, we seem to get burned out so easily because we've got a lot of things coming at us at one time. We have a business and that's our baby, as well as our babies. But all of this really burns us out. Why should we take time away from our businesses?

Christine Laperriere:
I'm going to start by rephrasing that question. I love this question, but as soon as you say to an entrepreneur, "Should we take time away?" You got to think of us. We're a little bit like addicts with using our time to create a business. What I actually am a advocate of, and I talk about this in Too Busy To Be Happy, is this concept of understanding what your emotional real estate is. So it's the energy, the fixed amount of budgeted energy, that we all have to manage everything that's coming bad us in life. So, things with kids, things with unknowns, things with spouses, conflict, change, just trying to build healthy habits, uses a lot of emotional real estate. Dealing with my three and a half year old son who has decided he's boycotting sleep this week, that uses up a lot of emotional real estate and then trying to manage a business and even fear of the unknown uses a lot of emotional real estate.

Christine Laperriere:
So what I really would say is I pay attention to activities that give back more emotional real estate than they take. And so what I would advocate for is instead of thinking of it as taking time away from the business, I would talk about it as investing time in doing activities that give back more energy than they take. Just like I was saying to you as we start started the show, 20 minutes on the treadmill today, just to give myself a chance to catch my breath and get a little bit of movement. That activity gave more energy back than it took. And that's where I feel like it's not about taking time away from my business, it's actually about investing in activities that give me energy back, that allow me to use that as a budget against my business.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that approach. Now, when you work from home though, as most of us do, some of us, parents, it can get hard. Now, do you have any tips for that?

Christine Laperriere:
Well, I will say working from home, it's a very unique challenge. When I started my business in 2008, a couple of things that I did that really helped, so I had a dedicated office space, everything work related stayed in that space, even though it wasn't a [inaudible 00:05:32] room, it was kind of my little den, leveraged the power of habit, because now we're using our unconscious mind to get things done. So, habit is powerful. So I used to wake up every day and make my coffee, walk my dog, all that good stuff, and by nine o'clock, I was always in my office and I was always seated at my desk, getting ready to work. And what I found is then, at the end of the day, I would then get up, move away and go somewhere else in the house.

Christine Laperriere:
And so, I am a big advocate for don't work in your living room, even if it is just a desk, and that desk is your anchor for where you work. Just being very mindful because the brain is a funny thing. So, if you sit down with the same exact desk every day with the intention of work, your brain was start to do that and perpetuate that for you. And so anything you can do to build some habit. I found noise-canceling headphones to be absolute savior, still going back and using the same office space and really teaching the kids to stay away from that desk, kind of teaching them what that meant, helping your family start to recognize what those routines look like and what those rituals look like. So that it makes them easier for them to know what the ground rules are.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that you said that you have to create habits because this is so important for us, as parents, entrepreneurs, any of us. It's so important for us. And I remember the saying "Repetition is the mother of skills". So if you continue to just do this routine while you're at home, then eventually things will become natural. Christine, with your expertise, what would be the number one best wealth practice advice you would give to parents who are entrepreneurs and why?

Christine Laperriere:
It's an interesting one. The first that I think of is to always have six months to a year of salary in your bank account, as soon as you can achieve it. Again, I understand the difference between a startup and a long term business, they are two different things. So if you just started your business yesterday, don't be disappointed, it's coming. But to think very consciously, when I began my business, I thought very strategically about paying myself a salary. Fortunately, I was around a lot of other entrepreneurs and I got a chance to learn some of these tips from them, but I paid myself a salary that was a little bit under what I was actually making and just kind of learnt to live on that salary, again, once I got my business off the ground. And what I found is that six months to a year of savings does this incredible thing where you make more clear and conscious decisions around your business, you fire the bad customers.

Christine Laperriere:
It's almost like if you think of driving a car, it's like, if you're constantly terrified that you're going to run out of gas, like you're swerving to the left, you're swerving to the right, you're driving like a maniac, but if you know you have a little something in the tank, there's no need to overreact. I started my business in 2008, so I think it was very good advice. But once I had a little bit of cash in the bank and I didn't ever treat that as spending money, that is my salary, that's kind of my extra run rate for my salary. So if I have a bad month or a customer doesn't pay or something happens, I'm going to be fine next week, it's going to be fine. So it allows me to handle those decisions without overreacting or even being emotional in those situations, because I know the sky's not going to fall.

Christine Laperriere:
And then perfect example of this was recreated because when the pandemic hit, I have a business where I'm on site a lot with large companies, and first thing that happens when crisis hits is large companies cut budget for all leadership development and investment in their people, unfortunately that a lot of them do. And second thing that happens is when all your work is on site, all of it gets canceled, so there's nothing for me to build. So it was a classic example of this. I had a year's worth of cash in the bank as part of my business strategy. I've done that for 13 years. I kind of just looked at my husband, I'm looking at my kids and I'm like, "Well, we're good for a year. We got a year to figure this out." And he's looking at me going, "Well, most pandemics last 18 months." and I'm going [inaudible 00:09:43]. But that said, I mean, it was just nice to not have that on top of everything else. And it would've been so easy to live the lifestyle that would've used up that whole budget. But the point is protect that. I'm always thinking about that, how many months of advance am I good for, when I do my budgeting and my financing.

Jenelu Payne:
I love that. That is the best advice.

Christine Laperriere:
Think about the benefits of decision making when you're not on under stress, when you're not scared about feeding your kids next week. You make better decisions. As a parent, when you think you're not going to be able to feed your kids, you act crazy, which is normal in nature, mother nature lets us do that. But it makes being a parent, you're going to be quick to throw in the towel, you're going to be quick to go for somebody, you're going to be quick to make stupid decisions, you know?

Jenelu Payne:
You're right. I can really agree to that because like you said, when you are at that level of stress, you really don't think properly. And also it's not giving you time to be free to create for your children, for your legacy. It's just really hard on top of that. So it's really and truly the best advice that you can give someone is to make sure that, "Hey, you are really secure." And that way you can have that peace of mind because us, as parents, we long for a peace of mind. What are some systems or strategies that we can put in place that will help entrepreneurs have a better work life and family life balance?

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah. I mean the one thing that I'm really thoughtful of and I really point the phrase "Work-life-wisdom". So I always say work life balance is the wrong long term because nothing is 50-50 and my days never look 50-50 to be honest. But what I do know, and I would encourage every parent to get really clear on, is what their work life wisdom looks like. So what is it that you specifically need, in your situation, given who you are and what makes you happy? What do you need to make it all work? So, for example, for me, I have two very young children and I'm in that particular phase right now. So they're not teenagers, they're not eating at friends' houses or anything. And I want to have dinner with my family every night. So, before the pandemic, my rule was I only wanted one night in which I would not eat with my family.

Christine Laperriere:
And that meant if I was going out of town for a speaking engagement or to teach, I wanted to take the last flight out that night and I would try to make sure that I was back within 24 to 48 hours. But I would try to have dinner with my kids four out of five nights a week. And that was just what my work life wisdom was. So if I was planning any kind of travel, like if I was planning to be somewhere, I'd even plan to be in the conference, I'd ask them to put me up in the afternoon versus the morning, because my work life wisdom tells me, as soon as I miss two meals with my kids in a week, I feel like a disconnected mom. I can live without feeding them breakfast or I can miss more breakfast, but something about that dinner time is really important to me.

Christine Laperriere:
For me, that's my work-life-wisdom. I might go back to work after the kids go to bed. But I also am really conscious of... I like to have a couple hours a week where George and I watch Netflix together at nine o'clock at night with no kids around. And for us, that's our time to just hang out as friends and just be partners and not have the pressure of our children around. And so I kind of have a couple of these things that are very important, sacred work life wisdom activities, and it might not look 50-50. So if I took the hours I dedicate to my business to the hours of these practices, they're not 50-50. There's probably 20 hours of real life happening here and there's easily 50 hours of business. But they're so important to me because when I look at myself in the mirror, that's how I get to feel like I'm a committed mom, committed partner, and that I'm living my best life and I'm living the life that I'm here for. I'm not chained to my business at the expense of everything.

Jenelu Payne:
Oh, yeah. That is so good. Everything that you said, it really resonate with me as well, as a parent and an entrepreneur. I also feel that it if you have that balance, you won't get so burned out. What do you do when you can't handle the life you've created and wish you had more time?

Christine Laperriere:
As you get further into being an entrepreneur, starting to ask 'who?', not 'how?', becomes a really important question. So I have easily six or seven different people who have very specific expertise that I pay to do their magic. And to me, that's what being an entrepreneur should be. It's like we get paid to do our magic. It's not a time thing, we're getting paid to do the thing that we are particularly talented in, but that's exactly it. So having people paid to do the things that use up a lot of emotional real estate, for me, is huge. Use the money that you do make to help balance out that energy. Don't be afraid to... Again, ask 'who', not 'how', especially as you get a little further in and you've got a little bit more financial resources.

Jenelu Payne:
Oh, yeah, definitely. I love that you said the 'who', not the 'how', because I think a lot of us as entrepreneurs, we always want to do everything for ourselves at first. Now, you are an Amazon bestselling author, with the book called Too Busy to Be Happy. Now, tell us more about this book and why should we get it?

Christine Laperriere:
Sure. I mean, one thing that I talk about in the book, you'll definitely hear me talk about being an entrepreneur and stress management. So I think that might be one of the biggest reasons right there, but the thing is it's a bit of a cautionary tale of burnout and what that looks like, because high performing, hard workers, we are at risk for burnout. And my own experience is just a perfect example of that. In 2007, I went through kind of a breakup and too many promotions and all of a sudden I'm managing teams in two different countries and I'm flying I'm back and forth and all this kind of thing, and didn't know how to shut things off and eventually found myself in a doctor's office. And after numerous tests, the doctor says, "Well, you just got to learn to manage your stress better. Oh, and or here's a prescription for Ativan."

Christine Laperriere:
And then it kind of got worse. And I really woke up one day staring at the ceiling, wondering if it would be good if I could just get sick so that I could have permission to leave my work. And so I tell that story because it's something that so easily happens. And it's interesting, the first time I told that story was 2012, I got asked to teach a class called Mastering Me for women of influence, I was so vulnerable telling this story. I was shaking. This is such an embarrassing thing to admit, right? But I had people come up to me at the end of that class and say, "I'm there. And I'm there right now. And I really understand that story." And then I started telling it more and more.

Christine Laperriere:
So I got asked to do more speaking gigs and even a very large room, I almost always have 10 to 12 people that walk up to me, not just to say, "Thanks for speaking," but who say, "That has happened to me. That exact thing has happened to me. And I thought I was the only person that had ever happened to." And so my argument number one is this, just learn to manage your stress better, nobody understands what that actually is. And so I started to put... I went on a mission to really understand, how do high performing really hardcore people learn how to [inaudible 00:17:44] manage our stress better. And I really did get some very useful tools in there about ways to break things down and categorize them. So you can really understand what's happening. And it's not just your usual stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
I hate to say this, I love Oprah, I'm a giant Oprah fan, but when I get an Oprah blog and it's like, "Meditate more. Go to yoga." You know what? I put meditate on my calendar and now I'm missing my meditation and I'm even more stressed. It's just one more failure, one more thing that I'm missing that day that I should have gotten done. And so I have found that I had to come up with a completely different way of thinking of stress management and how I get out in front of it, because just saying, "Take time to meditate," or "Take time to yoga," or "Take time do this," that wasn't enough for me, it didn't work enough. So I needed a larger, broader system to work. And that's really what I work on in the book.

Jenelu Payne:
I love this. And it is so good that we have someone like you, Christine, to make us aware of this and be okay with talking about it. Now, this is a question that I ask anyone that I interview. Now, what does building a wealthy legacy means to you?

Christine Laperriere:
I thought about that question and something snapped in me a little bit because I was kind of going down the path of money and wealth and here's one of the things struggle with a little bit, it's that I've read over and over again that generational wealth is often lost by the next generation, so one of the things that I'm actually more passionate about than creating generational wealth, I know you asked of wealth legacy, and this is kind of how I think about it, is I really want my kids and to be honest, one of my passion projects to do this for more kids than just my own, but I want to teach kids how to fish. Like, I want to teach them the mindset that actually builds wealth for them personally. And I think this is so cool.

Christine Laperriere:
Like, in a previous life, I was with somebody who had a daughter and I was trying to teach her why walking dogs in exchange for money was a really good thing. And she's like, "Well, I would walk the dogs for free. Because I love the dogs." And I'm like, "That's exactly the type of activity we want you to get paid for." Because that to me is a wealthy legacy, getting paid for the thing that you like doing, to begin with. And also teaching her how she can truly have whatever she wants, if she's willing to be creative about how she earns wealth, to make those things happen. So I really had a bit of a rich dad, poor dad, experience in my own life where my dad came out of Corporate America and he worked that salary job for 30 years and did all the right things. And that did create a very nice lifestyle. But then as I went into management consulting, I was around a lot of self-made millionaires. And so I watched their mindset and the way they raised their kids and they taught their kids how to start businesses, and they taught their kids how to get paid for things that they had passion for. And they taught their kids how to build scale. And I'm like, "To me, that's going to be my legacy."

Jenelu Payne:
Absolutely. Oh, my goodness. You know what, Christine? You're so on point, because this is the subject that I really love to talk about, as far as leaving a wealthy legacy. And to me, like you said, teaching children how to fish, teaching different strategies on how to build a business, things of that nature. I am so passionate about it because, hey, our children are our future. And if we teach this to them right now, then they'll be able to teach their kids so on and so forth. That's the biggest meaning of building a wealthy legacy.

Christine Laperriere:
I'll not be teaching them how to find somebody to work for and just hold on tight and never lose that job for 30 years. It won't be that lesson. It'll be, sure go work for somebody if you want to work for somebody, but you stay empowered, you do it because it feels good and it's the right use of your time. And if you go work for a terrible boss, pack up your stuff and go be so valuable that you can work anywhere else.

Jenelu Payne:
Exactly.

Christine Laperriere:
That's the kind of lesson. I want you to be empowered. You're not going to be at the mercy of everything because honestly, I mean, who knows how much wealth I'll leave to my children. But if they know how to fish, they'll be wealthy forever.

Jenelu Payne:
Be wealthy forever and that's the key. Oh, my goodness. Christine, it was such a pleasure.

Christine Laperriere:
Love the topic. You know what? I love it. I think that I like the concept of parents, I like that it's inclusive of both men and women because lots of men are in the same boat as a lot of us women. And I think it's very cool, what you're doing.

Jenelu Payne:
Thank you so much. It was such an honor to interview you.
