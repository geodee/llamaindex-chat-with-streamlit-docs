Title: Who's the boss?
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Michael Pilla

Christine Laperriere:
Now, today I'm excited because I have Michael Pilla on the show.
And what's really neat is as the show has gained popularity, I'm getting people who are reaching out to me and actually saying, hey, I actually have a best boss that I really want to talk about.
And so I'm excited because even though Michael and I haven't worked together, he thought of somebody and instantly felt like this was the right place to talk about it.
So, Michael, first of all, please introduce yourself and thank you so much for coming on the show.
Thank you.

Michael Pilla:
Thank you, Christine.
My name is Michael Pilla.
The name of my firm is Pilla Creative Marketing.
We are a digital marketing firm providing branding and content development for web, social, and email.
We have a very, very broad practice, although lately we've been focusing more on arts and culture organizations.
It's more or less a passion project for me.
A lot of arts and cultural organizations have taken a beating during the COVID situation, so I would really like to help them all get sort of back up and running.

Christine Laperriere:
Great.
Great.
That's a great area to focus on.
I'm just going to dive in.
When you heard the name of the show, what was the boss that came to mind for you?

Michael Pilla:
Well, there was two.
There were my first two bosses.
My first job was at a children's publishing company, and I was like an illustration major just out of college.
And after bumping around for a year, I decided I needed a job.
I had been seeing art directors for illustration work, and I sent out a whole bunch of letters, Xerox letters, to the art directors I had met while I was looking for illustration work.
And this woman named Barry got in touch with me and said, Hi, you know, I remember sending out letters like this when I got out of school.
So we sort of had a connection in that way.
So she sort of guided me through the interview process.
And it really wasn't much of a process because I was a low level designer.
But she basically took me in, took me under her wing for a while, sort of really got me started in the design business, showed me about scheduling deadlines, what it was like to work part of a team.
And then just as everything was going really, really well, she left to go get another job.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, no.

Michael Pilla:
Right.
Now, you would think that would be the end of the story, but we actually kept in touch for a good 15, 20 years after that.
We'd have lunch occasionally.
She became something of a mentor to me.
We became friends on a certain level.
And down the road, she was able to give me some very important projects.
She got a job with a huge trade publication company.
So I was able to design several magazines for her.
She actually gave me my first website job, a job with a fabric company.
And she was basically trying to get them into the 20th century.
So she handed me their first major website.
And I had been sort of fooling around with websites, as everybody did back then, just sort of like in the 90s.
Everybody was fooling around with websites, but she trusted me enough to hand me their first big web project.
So in a sense, she gave me two first jobs.
She gave me my first real job in the business, and then she sort of launched my web career with that job.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
When you're thinking about even that first job that she gave you, you were probably trying to navigate that environment and you probably didn't know a lot at that point.
What did she do to kind of help guide you along the way?

Michael Pilla:
She was like, again, she sort of took me under her wing and she sort of explained a little bit of the office politics, that it wasn't just designing nice things, it was how to deal with certain situations and certain people.
Children's publishing looks like a lot of fun and it is a lot of fun from the outside, but there's a lot of sensitivity on the inside.
So that's so much politics.
But people are very, very sensitive as to the messages you're putting out.
And a lot of messages have factions, shall we say.
And if you have one really good story, is we were doing one of these sports characters in a particular feature of the magazine, one that represented by a certain sports character.
So we hired a caricatrist who did a really good caricature of O.J.
Simpson.
This is before O.J.
Simpson was O.J.
Simpson.
But there was a group of parents who objected to the caricature.
And they didn't like, his ears were funny, his cheekbones were funny, and they basically thought we were making fun of African-Americans to be blunt with caricature.
So we had a meeting with them and we ended up having to change it.

Christine Laperriere:
Did she give you some coaching on that then?

Michael Pilla:
Yes, definitely.
Well, it was just interesting to see how something that was really so innocent could just really sort of blow out of proportions on a children's magazine.
This is the New York Times or anything.

Christine Laperriere:
But it makes sense, right?
You need to know your audience and know how things are going to impact them.
So that makes sense.

Michael Pilla:
That's what I learned basically, is know your audience.
It's a classic, but it never goes away.
And know your audience.

Christine Laperriere:
You said there were two bosses that came to mind.

Michael Pilla:
Yeah, the second major job I got was with a direct mail publisher.
And she hired me as her assistant.
Direct mail back then was very, very hectic.
We would do all our Christmas promotion in July.
And even though I started out as pretty much like a production person, I kept trying to work up into doing more design work.
And she saw that.
And at one point she first shared with and then practically handed me a particular section of their direct mail package.
It was something referred to as an enclosure.
So we had a catalog, which were the main items.
And then the enclosures were items that wanted a feature.
When I started taking over, the enclosures started to outsell the catalog.
Oh, wow.
It was a book.
It was an online book publisher.
And I like to tell people the innovation I brought to the job was that I read the books.

Christine Laperriere:
That was the secret.

Michael Pilla:
Well, I treated each book like it was a separate market.
So if it was a mystery book, and what kind of mystery book is, and then let's design an ad or whatever that would appeal to people who like mystery books, that kind of stuff.
She gave me a lot of leeway.
As long as I wasn't doing anything stupid, she basically let me go my own way and do what I will with those projects.
And there was a few times where I tripped up, I made some mistakes, stupid mistakes, but she was always behind me.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.
So tell me about the stupid mistakes.
Things like typos, things like missing a deadline, just like kid stuff, really.
But instead of turning it into a tragedy, someone else would have used that as an excuse to sort of pull work away from me.
But she just reprimanded me, told me not to do it again, and we just sort of moved forward from there.
Towards the end, this is how long ago this was.
They really started to get interested.
Actually, I kind of nudged them in that direction to go out and buy a Mac.
It was one of the first Macs.
So one of the last things I did for them was to help them set up an internal electronic publishing capability.
It was very, very rudimentary compared to what you can do today.
But back then, this was like we discovered fire.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It was a big deal.

Michael Pilla:
And again, they kind of allowed me to run with that.
I came in all excited about Macs and electronic publishing and everything.
And they basically said, okay, let's see what you can do with it.

Christine Laperriere:
Even if they had to probably put budget against it, right?

Michael Pilla:
They did.
And there wasn't a lot of budget back then.
I mean, it was more like, what are we going to do with this thing, even if we buy it?
There were higher-end computers involved with publishing.
Most of those had to do with heavy-duty printing, printing plates for printers, and very little of them.
That was the advantage of the Mac, is that it was very, very flexible.
Well, the thing is, a lot of the traditional printers tried to say, oh, we could do that.
But of course, the problem was they had to run film for everything.
The Stone Age of printing.
They're doing film.
They don't do film anymore.
What it meant is if they did film for everything, if you wanted to make a change, you had to go back and rerun film.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Lots of extra steps.

Michael Pilla:
Because it wasn't totally digital.
It was a hybrid of digital and analog.
They tried to sell that, but the Mac, as Zach grew up, he grew up into something that was completely digital, which gave designers all kinds of freedom for good and for ill.

Christine Laperriere:
So this is interesting.
When you were working for these best bosses, just tell me, first of all, did you know you were working for a best boss at the time?

Michael Pilla:
Yeah.
It was two very comfortable relationships.
We actually managed to get close.
There was clearly a hierarchy, but we really had to be friendly after a while.
Go to lunch, go to drinks, that kind of stuff.
We never crossed any lines.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
But still, you build a real working relationship that you value versus just coming in and transactional.

Michael Pilla:
Since the relationship reached a personal level, we were able to work out things out of the office.
So it just made everything a lot easier.

Christine Laperriere:
And then, what do you think the impact is to the business?
So in my world, I do a lot of work with high potential talent and people who are on the track to being managers, leaders, like I said, future best bosses.
And I always get asked, what's the impact to the business?
If you had to guess, what was the impact to the business in these cases where you worked for best bosses?

Michael Pilla:
Personally, the impact of the business was they got a lot out of me.
I mean, I really performed very, very well.
In the case of the book publisher, I made them a lot of money.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
So you made them quite a bit more money.

Michael Pilla:
I was able to make a larger impact due to the freedom my bosses gave me.
They got the best out of me, and that helped the company.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, right?
So yeah, you have this kind of entry-level, young, ambitious type.
And they got out of your way enough to let you...

Michael Pilla:
Right.
I mean, I've had subsequent jobs where they would tell me to stop, you know, Mike, you're only a designer.
Why are you bringing up all this other stuff, you know?
And I always saw design with a big D, you know, that it touches and involves a lot of things.
And then people would hire me with design with a little D, which means, you know, we need you to do type corrections.
Just, you know, just do that production work and we'll be happy.
And they try to convince them, no, but there's other things we could be doing, you know, that would make this entire thing work better.

Christine Laperriere:
I like your point about designing with a big D versus a little D, right?
Because I think I see a lot of people believe that their role is to manage detail.
And they do, they miss the broader opportunity.

Michael Pilla:
My first two jobs, I take a bigger picture as possible.
Without even consciously doing it, I mean, I have a very good memory and I have very good hearing.
And I would basically know what everybody was doing, even though it was none of my business.
So more than once, someone would say, you know, what was Charlie working on?
And I'd say, oh, he was doing those things over there.
And they go, why did you know that?
Well, you know, I heard him talking.
And it became like the department, like encyclopedia.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.
So in your career, have you had what I would call less than great bosses?

Michael Pilla:
Not so much a boss, but someone who I worked for and with.
They could be a real handful.
They would start out being very like complimentary.
And we actually did some very, very good creative work together.
But at some point, you know, they would always turn, you know, and they would get very either critical or if there was a problem, they'd throw you under the bus.
Or if they thought you were getting more attention than they were, they would start undercutting you.
I've had a person try to steal business from me.
You know, I would bring them in on a big project.
And the next thing I know, she tries to make it their client and not my client.
And that I'm actually working for them instead of working together.
You know, and this just really, really toxic situation where, and it could be a real mix of being very competent.
I mean, it's manipulative, very complimentary, you know, combined with being very condescending.

Christine Laperriere:
Well, and it's interesting because that is, people don't love to be kind of like that feeling of being knocked down or treated as less than, you know what I mean?
Like it's just a human instinct, right?
None of us love to feel like that.

Michael Pilla:
And to go back to, to relate this back to the two bosses, I was saying the two bosses were very supportive if I did well.
They weren't threatened.
In fact, since they were my bosses, they sort of reflected well on them, you know, that they were working with people who were exceeding and excelling.
They never saw it as taking away from their sunshine, as it were.
Another person, if someone else got up, there's one little story.
So I'm talking to another guy who's working with this person and he says, oh, you know, she has this great new assistant, you know, they have this great new assistant, really like working with her.
How long has she been working with this person?
And the guy I'm talking to says she's been there about three weeks.
He's doing a great job.
I said, well, she'll be gone in about two weeks.
He was too many compliments.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.
So out of the gate was always kind of lovely.
But then all of a sudden, when you started to see.

Michael Pilla:
Well, like a lot, I don't know the psychological term for this, but the type of person that could be very charming, very even seductive, very, you know, very nice work with, very productive.
Everything looks just wonderful up to the minute where it's not.
And then all of a sudden, you know, you're a moron.
You can't be trusted.
And if any little thing goes wrong, it's not their fault.
You know, they're more than willing to throw you under the bus.
So it's really abusive after a while.

Christine Laperriere:
Sounds narcissistic.

Michael Pilla:
Totally.
I like that.
It's toxic narcissism.
Yep.
Absolutely.
Totally abusive, totally narcissistic.
And it's something to really watch out for, because you just waste a lot of time with people like.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Well, and you know, I, a lot of the times in coaching conversations, you know, it's important to remind people like they have choice of who they want to work for, you know, like we're not prisoners.

Michael Pilla:
Right.
Right.
Yes.
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
And I think that will help.
Like the more people do leave when they don't work for great leaders, the faster we start to correct some of that problem, you know, but as soon as we convince people that they're in a box and they have to tolerate it, it's hard to get people to believe.

Michael Pilla:
It gets worse.
And it's like, once those people know you're in a box, they just really dump all over you.
You know, it's just like, you know, it's like you're like, you're in a trap.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a tough one because I see that a lot.
And there's something in high performing people, there's a small segment that some of that narcissism works because they're very competitive and they excel.
They know how to work a room and all of that.
But the problem is, is once they become leaders, they become very toxic.
So quick question.
If you had to, you know, teach or advise leaders on how to be a best boss, given everything you've seen in your experience, what would you tell them to focus on?
What would you tell them to do and be explicit?
Give them, you know, practices.
What would they do?

Michael Pilla:
I mean, it starts with respecting the people we work with and insist that they respect you.
You know, there's the thing in the military where, you know, your subordinates owe you obedience, but you owe them care.
You're leading guys at the battle.
Yeah, they're supposed to follow you, but it's up to you to make sure that you're not putting them in harm's way.
You know what I mean?
So that's the two-way ladder of leadership in that situation.
So yeah, you want to, first of all, total respect on everybody's level.
I think it's important to encourage that, to get the best out of the people you're working with, not to be overly critical.
And if things do go wrong, use those as teaching situations.
Give people leeway to be themselves.
You know, you may have the best idea, but maybe somebody has something better.
I would also say be very clear and decisive.
I've worked for people who like to make a consensus.
I do invite, you know, people's opinions.
I do invite, you know, alternate ways of doing things, but it's all about the understanding is that I'm the guy in charge and it's my decision.
It's my client, it's my job, it's my clients, my department, it's my, you know, behind.
So we're going to go my, I welcome all your input because that does affect my decision, but the final decision has to be mine.
And I think that that makes things a lot clearer.
And when you do make a decision, make it clear.
And on the other side of that, if it's clear after a while that that decision is not working, make another one.
Don't dig a hole for yourself, you know.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't double down on a bad decision.

Michael Pilla:
And also the general is just treat people as people.
You know, I always try to get to know the people who are working for me a little bit, you know, just on a slight personal level.
So I get a sense of, I mean, I find that helps with just general communication.
You know, if I really, if I know people better, I can read them better.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
I've always believed that.

Michael Pilla:
Tell what they're talking about, what they're having issues if, you know, just how things are going that way.
But it has to do basically with treating people as people, you know, give them leeway, take responsibility and be in charge, you know.

Christine Laperriere:
Great.
Well, listen, I think that's a fantastic thinking for everybody out there today.
Anything else you want to add?

Michael Pilla:
Well, this is an aside.
Part of leadership, especially in a business situation, is managing your clients.
People don't see that as part of leadership because, you know, you've got to deal with, you're taking orders and you have to use those orders not only to get the job done, but to also, you know, take care of your team.
And I became very good at dealing with clients when I became a parent.
And it was one day I'm leaving home.
I have a three-year-old daughter who's just, I don't know where she is.
She's inconsolable, but she's just noise.
So I get myself to the office and I'm dealing with a client who's exactly the same way.
He's screaming all over the place.
So I was just like dealing with the baby.
Same technique.
I went, that's okay.
Tell me, tell me what the problem is.
Instead of, you know, running around and apologizing and what can we do?
And I just, just calm down a minute.
You know, tell me, try to tell me what's wrong.
Let's, let's focus on, you know, what the issue.
And more times than not, it's a small issue that just got blown out of proportion.
Right, right, right.
How do you get them to focus on the one thing?
And a lot of times instead of the stupidest, I really hate green.
Okay, let's remove the green.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, right.
This is solvable.

Michael Pilla:
This is solvable.

Christine Laperriere:
That's funny.
I have young kids and I find that there's days where you just start to realize that adults are just bigger young kids.

Michael Pilla:
It was really funny because I finished dealing with my daughter and I was using the exact same approach on the client.
It was sort of an eye-opener.
The other eye-opener was, are you familiar with the dog whisperer?

Christine Laperriere:
Yes, Caesar Milan.

Michael Pilla:
Yeah, now that works too.
Okay, dogs are pack animals.
So a pack animal will instinctively look for a leader.
Now, if there is no leader, the pack animal decides they are the leader.
That's why little dogs are hard to control.
There's people, people give them a lot of leeway and so the dog thinks it's a leader.
So the dog thinks it's running the house.
So you have to be very calm but assertive and get the dog into a place where it is sort of passive.

Christine Laperriere:
It knows that there is a leader in the house.

Michael Pilla:
And it makes them comfortable because they know what the story is.
So I had this one boss who was literally a bulldog and again another yeller and I refused to give into the yelling and I just related to him in a very much, you know, calm and assertive way.
I answered his questions very quietly and it triggered something because he calmed down and he was fine.
As I got to a point, we get to the end of the conversation and he goes, so he says, is this environmentally safe?
Because there was part of their thing with this building they were doing a whole environmental thing.
I go, Alan?
I said, this is printed on recycled paper with soy ink.
I said, you'll be able to eat this thing when we're finished.
You know, so he went, yeah, okay.
But he never gave me any trouble because I always approached him like without fear, without trepidation, without fear and just one-to-one.
I mean, you know, look him in the eye and say what I had to say and it literally triggers something in the human mind.
They go somewhere else.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a good reminder, you know, I'm smiling and loving this conversation about, you know, the tie into parenting and dog whispering because, you know, I completely agree that humans are pack animals, right?

Michael Pilla:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
We do.
Exactly.
We look for a leader.
We are looking and I'm thinking about it just while you're talking and thinking about different places that I coach and support and work alongside.
You know, you mentioned the point of consensus, right?
And when somebody looks like they're not going to take a leadership stance, you end up with a lot of people getting confused and rallying for leadership.
It's just such an interesting, you know, and I love the dog whisper correlation.

Michael Pilla:
Right.
No, it becomes like a mess because everybody's going to have their two cents and the issue becomes more about people having their two cents than about getting something done.
You're reminded with a mishmash, which may or may not work, but that really wasn't the point.
Everybody had to feel good.
I mean, there's a lot of ways to feel good.
You know, you can feel good that you got your point in, but you could just feel good that you were part of a team that accomplished something regardless of what your contribution was.
So there's that.
But yes, actually, dogs, I did some studies of this after a while, but the psychology of dogs and humans are very, very close.
Sociologists are wondering if the relationship between men and dogs, it isn't simply that men started or women or whoever, people started feeding dogs.
That there was already like a common thought process, you know, which in primitive times led to the hunt.
They both hunted in similar ways.
They hunted in packs.
You don't mind me going on here, but then apparently in prehistoric time stuff, they would hunt together.
They'd be hunting the same animal.
And they got to the point where they would start cooperating.
And out of that led the domestication of dogs.
So it wasn't that they were hanging around people to get a free meal.
There was some sort of a sympathetic connection between the way they thought and the way they reacted to each other.

Christine Laperriere:
That's interesting.
Like I said, be on my mind today as I go forward.
I'll be thinking about that because I agree.
And I've always said that there is something, you know, in that pack leadership piece that I noticed that's very hard to describe sometimes when I'm working with a group, but I can feel it.
I can feel the who's the boss confusion.
And what ends up happening is people instinctively, even really good people who don't have any negative intent, will start to rally for some territory or something that they can dominate because they're confused.

Michael Pilla:
Yeah.
That's when it gets out of control.
Yeah.
No, we're not talking about somebody standing on the desk, yelling, I'm in charge, but just somebody who can, you know, logically guide the group to where it needs to be.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
Because if there isn't that perceived guidance, it gets confusing for people.
You see the infighting start to pick up, right?

Michael Pilla:
The two things Cesar Millan says is basically you need to be calm and assertive.
The leader is calm and assertive that that will trickle through the group.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
Well, listen, Michael, this was a lot of fun.
And I think- 

Michael Pilla:
Yes, same here.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the kind of corners of this conversation and where they went.
This is fun for me.
So thank you so much.
