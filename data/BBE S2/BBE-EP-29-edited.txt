Title: Pretend you have done this 100 times
Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Omnia Helba

Christine Laperriere:
I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, and with me today, I have Omnia Helba.
Thank you, Omnia, for joining me.

Omnia Helba:
Thanks for having me, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
So really quick, before we get started, just give a 30-second introduction, Omnia, so everybody knows who you are.

Omnia Helba:
Sure.
My name is Omnia Helba, and I have worked in talent and organizational development for the last approximately 15 years.
I'm currently with the Ministry of Attorney General and leading a high-performing team focused on all things people-centered.

Christine Laperriere:
And I was so glad to invite you onto the show because we had the opportunity to work together on diversity, inclusion, and equity at Sobeys.
And so we actually got a chance to do some great work there together.
And I genuinely enjoyed working with you.
So it was great to reach out and invite you onto the show.
Thank you.
I'm going to just dive in.
Who is your best boss ever and why?
Tell us.

Omnia Helba:
OK, so I'm going to tackle this one a little bit differently.
Christine, because I've had a lot of really great bosses and I have to really talk about what the theme has been throughout my entire career.
And I'll say that the best bosses I've had have just had this unwavering trust in me and in my ability before I did, truthfully.
So they're the ones who really saw my potential and trusted me to bring it out.
Early on in my career, quite frankly, I probably wasn't actually that confident.
So when I think about my very first real job opportunity after completing my master's, it was at the YWCA with a great woman named Denise Doyle, who just loves to empower women.
And I was so nervous, I'd never facilitated anything before.
And I was about to facilitate something to the leadership team.
And she said to me, you know what, Omnia, you've never done this before.
She said, I know that and you know that, but no one else knows that.
And she was like, so just go out there and pretend you've done this a hundred times.
And it's exactly what I did.
And nobody could tell.
And it was just it was so empowering.
Like it was just in, you know, you're fresh out of school, 23 years old.
And it was just such an awesome experience.
And that's been the theme throughout my career.
And I would say, like, I'm happy to share more examples.
But I would say that that was kind of the the first opportunity I had to see what it was like to really have a great boss.

Christine Laperriere:
So what did that do for your confidence?

Omnia Helba:
It skyrocketed like Christine.
She that's what I was saying.
She believed in me before I believed in myself.
And I just think that that to me spoke volumes about the impact a leader can have on their employee.
You really are in a position where you can make your employee feel that, you know, sky's the limit.
They've got all this potential.
Or she could have turned around and said, OK, maybe you're not ready for this yet.
Let me do this.
Right.
And I've seen bosses do that as well.
And just by choosing that approach to take the risk on me.
And I mean, it was obviously a minor risk, but, you know, she took the risk.
She said, it's fine.
Worst case scenario, you mess this up.
It's OK.
Nothing.
You know, the world's not going to end.
And it did.
It really helped to boost my confidence, for sure.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Omnia Helba:
And she gave you all that power at 23 years old.

Christine Laperriere:
She did.

Omnia Helba:
She saw something I didn't, clearly.
But I'm so grateful to her for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Omnia Helba:
And then so you said there's a theme and there's numerous bosses that have done similar things.
So tell me more about those.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Omnia Helba:
So when I went over to Walmart, I had a boss named Stephanie Hardman.
And she was over.
She's over at McDonald's now leading their HR function.
And we went into it.
We were going into a meeting.
I was going to present employee engagement results to the chief operating officer.
My understanding is that she would present it.
I'd be there in case he had questions.
Again, not very senior in my career.
And we're sitting outside his office and she turns to me and she says, you know what, Amia, you've got this.
And I stopped.
I was like, got what?
She was like, you have this.
She's like, you're going to present this and I'll be there in case you need me.
And at this point, I'm obviously so nervous.
I barely had any meetings with this individual.
We walk in and I presented it.
It went extremely well.
You know, and she was just she was literally just sitting there in case I needed her.
And again, she trusted me before I trusted myself.
And it just it helped me go into that meeting with full confidence that I could do it.
And after that, I mean, I could present in front of anyone at any time and never be nervous again.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
Because the stakes were so high.

Christine Laperriere:
I think that's great because and I'll even just share personally, when I get really nervous and I'm going in front of a big group or I'm going to a big meeting, I use the mantra, you've got this.
I don't know where I got it from.
Somebody said it one time and I thought, what a great confidence boosting mantra.
And so sometimes I'll feel myself.
I'm like, my palms are sweaty and I feel kind of sick to my stomach because I'm getting ready to do, you know, a big speech or I'm getting ready to kick off a big program.
And I'll just keep telling myself, listen, you got this.
Like, this is not, you know, this is not the last day of your career.
As we know it.

Omnia Helba:
Right.
It's like we got this.
You know, I mean, those are the stories we tell ourselves.
Right.
And when you have a boss that's helping you realize those stories that you tell yourself about your own ability, I mean, that's life changing.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
And somebody's validating that to you, which is so powerful.
And they're putting that faith in you.
OK, so those are good ones.
Keep going.
What else do you have?

Omnia Helba:
Yeah.
Well, let me share one you actually know.
So Heather de Blas over at Sobey's, by far one of my favorite bosses, like just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader.
You know, when I started with her, we were kind of building equity, diversity, inclusion from the ground up at Sobey's.
It was, you know, brand new function.
It wasn't side of desk.
It was an actual team.
She gave me full creative power.
You know, she said, you know, help me design this from start to finish.
I told her I really love strategy.
She said, great, let me get you involved in the strategy, building of a strategy, said, you know, I really love facilitation.
She said, great, I'm going to put you right in there with facilitation and facilitating sessions.
I really love working with women.
Great.
We're going to build, you know, the first women's employee resource group for Sobey's and you can lead that work.
And so she really said I could design my dream job.
She really gave me full bandwidth to do exactly what I wanted to do.
And she believed that I could do it again.
It was just that trust that I told her I like to do something.
I told her I was good at it and she just trusted me.
She said, great, let's do it without making me second guess myself.
And just, you know, I think that, again, just brings out so much out of an employee where they feel like, you know what, I can go to work every day, I can feel confident, I can feel happy and I can do what I want to do.
Right.
And it's rare.
It's rare to find bosses like that.
I've been fortunate that I've had, you know, a few of them.
But those, I would say, are probably the ones that are the highlights of my career.
Excellent.
And I just hear this reoccurring theme, like you said, this unwavering trust for people extending the trust before you knew for sure you could do it or before you were proven yet.

Christine Laperriere:
Yes.
You know, I really I think that's important because that's a different flavor to trust.
That's not just I trust you can get the job done.
All right.
You know what I mean?
It's not just I know you're not going to, you know, throw me under the bus.
That's a different type of trust.
It's almost like I'm going to I'm going to throw you enough rope that I'm, you know, and I know you're going to succeed.
I'm going to help you swim.

Omnia Helba:
No, it's true.
And you know what, Christine, as a woman in hijab, I mean, I'm I'm very visibly different.
Right.
And it's not often that individuals from marginalized communities find sponsors in their career, especially so early on.
Right.
It's like so many individuals that I know have had to prove themselves time and time and time and time again before they're finally given opportunity.
And I would say that, you know, I'm fortunate.
It's definitely a privilege of mine that I haven't had to experience that multiple times in my career.
But these individuals knew they knew I was up against something different and they really wanted to make sure I was successful.
And just by being there and being so supportive, you know, it helped remove a lot of roadblocks for me.
Right.
They gave me that executive access.
They gave me the sponsorship.
They spoke highly of me behind closed doors and rooms where there was likely no one who looked like me.
And that was really powerful as well.

Christine Laperriere:
What is it like to work for these large organizations and probably not see a lot of people that look like you?

Omnia Helba:
You know, I would say early on in my career, it probably bothered me a little bit more.
You know, not seeing myself reflected in leadership was certainly a bit of a glass ceiling, like more than a glass ceiling.
You just couldn't see myself ever getting there.
You know, and I wanted to get there.
Like I was driven from my first job that I wanted to one day just be a really, you know, senior executive and not seeing that was definitely a flag to me to say, probably not going to get there.
Right.
That's kind of the message that was being sent to me.
I would say as I kind of grew more in myself and in my own confidence and my own capabilities, I stopped relying on that mindset.
I shifted towards, well, you know what?
I'll just be the first.
I'll be the first and I'll pave the way for others.
Right.
And I'm not the first.
And I'm so thankful now that there are more people who look like me in leadership.
And I'm so happy that that, you know, that's not going to be hopefully the same experience for others.
But, you know, for me, it was it was a shift to just say, OK, well, I'm going to have to make it through.
And again, if I didn't have those bosses, I didn't have those, you know, fantastic leaders.
I don't think I would have ever gotten to a point where I said, OK, I'll be the first.
Right.
Like they gave me that confidence, truthfully.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.
That's powerful.
When you reach those senior executive levels, what are some of the things that you'll advocate for to make sure that people like you coming into an organization feel valued and acknowledged like what would be some of the things that you can think of given your experience?

Omnia Helba:
So there's a few challenges.
That's a kind of a bit of a, you know, peel the onion kind of question because there's lots of layers involved.
So one, I think just even that redistribution of power and having individuals who are marginalized in those senior leadership positions already does something without actually having to act.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
So that's the first step, I think, is representation and that shift of power to individuals.
I think for me, and it's something I've always done throughout my career.
Anyway, it's also about giving people opportunity, right?
Opening the doors for them, seeing the roadblocks and removing them for individuals, extending the hand sponsorship.
Sponsorship is so huge, Christine, like I can't even emphasize how much more powerful it is even than mentorship.
Mentorship is great for a personal development piece, but that sponsorship to get people up the corporate ladder is just something else.
You know, and we want to pretend it doesn't exist.
We want to pretend that it only, you know, people move up just based on merit.
But the reality is, if people don't know who you are, you're probably not going to get that opportunity.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
So that's a big one as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Omnia Helba:
And then, of course, the mentorship, we've just launched a mentorship program where I am now for Black, Indigenous and racialized individuals in their career.
And more than just career coaching, it's also about that shared experience, like, you know, hearing from leaders how they got through some challenges.
And I just think that that has been powerful.
I'm mentoring someone now.
And, you know, she hasn't come to me a whole lot with, you know, your typical career questions, but more so of those challenges that she's facing and trying to get through.
And, you know, that's I think that's very enriching as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
Thank you so much for letting me pick your brain on that.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah, of course.

Christine Laperriere:
And so I'm going to ask you one more question.
I know you had a child during COVID.
And so now you have a very large family of four children.
Tell me a little bit about what it is like to be a woman with such a large family, also trying to navigate a career.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah, it's tough.
Well, you know, add COVID and kids being home and online schooling and all of that fun stuff and getting home sent home for two weeks at a time.
It's been extremely difficult, Christine.
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
It's probably been two of the hardest years of my life.
I also did start a new job with another fantastic boss, Naila Ibrahim.
And her support has been just incredible in terms of that flexibility to say, listen, I need to do pick up today for the kids.
I'm going to be offline from this time to this time.
You know, this kid's got a doctor's appointment.
I've got to go and I'll be back.
Right.
And just I think that recognition of being human.
And I think that's something we all need to do for one another right now is just recognize we're all just human and struggling is huge.
You know, as a woman as well, I would say for me, my husband and I are really good partners.
He's just, you know, he takes on a lot of load, a lot of the caregiver load.
And I was reflecting on that earlier today.
And I thought, you know, as a child growing up, my mom played, I would say, 100 percent role of a caregiver.
Right.
And my kids are growing up very differently.
My husband cooks, we share responsibility, we, you know, have to outsource some things.
And so they actually see us kind of as a split caregivers for them.
And I think that's helped quite a bit.
If I didn't have a partner who was so supportive, I don't know that I would have I would have been able to have such a large family and it's something we both wanted.
So, yeah, I think it's that that partnership has been really important.

Christine Laperriere:
That's amazing.
And I mean, from a to me, that's that speaks a lot about just the shifting perception of, you know, how we split responsibility.
You're able to have this great career.
And, you know, like you said, you're in a true partnership.
So that's fantastic.
And then I also think when you see organizations with, again, more moms and dads in the organization, I think it's it's where you start to see leadership, make those decisions to be flexible and supportive and understand that that's that's an important part of enabling somebody to be successful right now.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah.
And I think COVID, I mean, with all of its negativity, the one thing it's done is it's I mean, it's brought our personal lives into our work lives, right?
And we now have integration between the two.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, yeah, before.
Right.

Omnia Helba:
And now I'm not shy to tell someone, I'm sorry.
I don't I can't meet with you at that time.
I have to do pick up or I'm sorry.
I have to do drop off.
Whereas before, I probably would have been a little more hesitant to do that and would have, you know, just said, I'm sorry.
I have a conflict without openly sharing exactly why I can't make it at that time and in meetings with senior leaders.
And they're on the phone and we're going to go pick up my kid from school or I have to walk my dog at lunch or, you know, and I think it's changed, changed the culture quite a bit in organizations.
Excellent.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely.
So I'm just going to circle back to one or two more questions on the best boss.
So, you know, we talked about trust, and I appreciate this added element of flexibility in there.
You know, organizations are always asking why should they invest in creating best bosses, right?
Why why put dollars and cents against it?
And I mean, you know, from DEI initiatives, right?
Those are all costly initiatives, right?
So if you could identify what's the impact on the business.
I mean, I know this isn't an easy question, but in your experience, what have you seen as the impact on the business when you have great leadership?

Omnia Helba:
Well, definitely we see engagement levels rise, right?
And we know that engagement leads to productivity and people are more invested in their work.
You're able to get a little bit more of that discretionary effort.
So, you know, you're paying them nine to five, but if something needs to get done and they're highly engaged, they're going to work a little bit extra to get it done.
Right.
So that that I think has a deep dollar value associated with it.
We also see less absenteeism, lower turnover.
Like those are all things that that we've seen studies that demonstrate having a highly engaged workforce will impact.
So, you know, they're not necessarily you're not going to have exact dollar to dollar.
But I think when you have a highly engaged workforce with good bosses and good leadership, you're going to see a lot more productivity.
And that's, I think, the bottom line for a lot of organizations.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
I agree completely.
And so my last question for you is, have you ever had a not so great boss?
You don't have to name them or shame them.
But, you know, what was the impact on that like for you?
Like, what was the impact of their leadership on you and what were some of the things that you could identify that were not great practices?

Omnia Helba:
Yeah, you know, I've been fortunate.
I only have one boss that I didn't enjoy working for.
She just had the complete opposite of my other bosses in terms of lack of flexibility.
This individual experienced what I think was hardship early in their career.
And they didn't extend the olive branch and make it easier on the next person.
They, in fact, made it more difficult by, you know, for example, when I would come in 15 minutes late to work because my kid was sick and I had to do drop off and all these sort of things.
The expectation is I would stay 15 minutes behind, right, to make up for those 15 minutes.
And it was just that micromanagement.
And it really took away any motivation.
I had to do anything above and extra like above and beyond.
And I was fortunate to recognize that that wasn't a workforce that I wanted to be in.
And I left very quickly.
But I know a lot of people don't have the opportunity to leave and go somewhere else.
And they're stuck in situations for me.
It really demonstrated for me what I didn't want to do with my teams.
Right.
And so now when I lead, I think about the whole person.
I think about, you know, what else they have going on in their lives.
And people are going to have good days and bad days.
And they're going to have things that happen in their personal lives that we have to accommodate for.
And it really demonstrated to me what I didn't want.
And so I think it was good.
I think it was good for me to go through it because it made me really appreciate the good passes that I had after.
And I think it also made me a stronger leader because I am so careful not to do what was done to me.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I think that's a great answer.
And I hear that a lot.
It's the micromanagement.
It's, you know, to me, focusing on how many minutes you're in the office is just so irrelevant to real productivity and engagement and accomplishment.
You know, like we're not in the industrial age where you're, you know, if you're putting parts on a car, for example, then those 15 minutes matter.
Right.
But if you're.

Omnia Helba:
Yeah.
And I think also just the recognition that people are like, there are times, right, there are times where leaders do need to micromanage more than they want to because individuals simply aren't performing.
And that does happen.
Right.
That should be the exception to the rule and not your main.
That shouldn't be the rule that you apply to everyone.
It should be almost a last resort when you have to performance manage someone.
Unfortunately, I think leaders do the opposite.
They start with the assumption that, you know, employees need to do it.
And then they have to, you know, they have to earn their trust.
And I think that's just a really negative way to build a relationship.

Christine Laperriere:
Very backwards.
Excellent.
And then if you have any final tips, I mean, I have a fantastic audience of people who are out there trying to be excellent leaders.
So share any last words of wisdom or areas of focus that you would encourage people to really think about as they're trying to be their best boss.

Omnia Helba:
I think think about the whole person.
And, you know, we do a lot of this diversity and inclusion work right now.
And we tell people to bring their full selves to work, but then we don't treat them as a whole person.
So for those of us who want to be better leaders, I think we need to think in the context of what else is going on in their lives.
What else might they might they need support with?
What else can I do to facilitate them actually bringing their best selves to work and reaching their potential and also recognizing them?
You know, I didn't talk about that today, but recognition is huge.
And just, you know, it can be as minor as actually thanking your employees for a job well done, you know, but really giving them that recognition and ask them how they want to be recognized, how they prefer to be recognized.
And then I think even just those two things, if you're really focused on those two things, I think you'll have a stronger, more productive team.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.
I appreciate it so much.
Again, thank you for your time today.

Omnia Helba:
Thanks so much, Christine.
This was great.
