We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
So Steve, welcome to the show. And just as we're getting started, I have to explain why I'm so excited to have you specifically on the show. So we've had the opportunity to work together for over 10 years. I was thinking about it just this morning going, "Wow, it's been that long." And we've also had the chance to work on big account strategies together, looking at how do we transform sales organizations. So we've really gotten a chance to get into the weeds of a lot of work over the last 10 years. And so it just seemed like, I know that we've already had this conversation about what those best bosses look like and how do we bring some of that spirit to the work world. So it just seemed like you'd be the perfect guest for this show. So thank you so much for coming out.

Steve Robert:
Thanks so much for having me Christine. And, yeah, we've been working together for a long time, so appreciate that. And really looking forward to doing this and having this conversation.

Christine Laperriere:
So I'm just going to dive in because you know, I don't waste any time. So I can't wait to hear, tell me about your best boss ever.

Steve Robert:
Sure. Best boss ever was back, I'm going to say well over 10 years ago, when I worked with a food equipment manufacturer. This person just really did a phenomenal job in kind of shaping the future of my career path. And he did it in many different ways, but I would say the biggest thing for me was his ability to listen and engage. And those things for me were really powerful because he would be able to listen to a situation that I had encountered which at the time I felt was catastrophic, if you will. And really just getting emotional into the moment. And he was just so phenomenal at boiling things down, calming it down, distilling what the issues were and trying to work with me to find a solution. And that was incredibly powerful.

Steve Robert:
He did it with me, but he also did it with the other folks that reported directly into him. And I think that really helped to shape the future. From my perspective, it really opened my eyes as to what being a real leader is. And I've never forgotten it because I've also experienced the other side where you have a boss that doesn't listen so well. I definitely draw on the positives from my best boss ever.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. I think that's such a good example, where you're talking about you're getting emotional, you're getting fired up. And one thing I know in my own experience I get, especially earlier in my career, very emotional, very fired up about different topics and different issues, which is really just a sign of high employee engagement. But with the wrong boss, they deflate that, right. They almost crush your employee engagement because you care so much. But this one sounds like he was able to do quite the opposite. Like he was still able to leverage that engagement, but just redirect the energy.

Steve Robert:
Yes, very much so. And I think the one thing that he made me aware of is self-awareness. Having emotional intelligence to kind of look at a situation holistically versus just in that particular moment. And the biggest thing for me is if you hit the challenge or hit a wall, it doesn't mean that you stop there. You just got to find a way around or over the wall to get to that end game. I think those are the of positive draws. On the other side, you're right. If you don't have your best boss ever, and you're confronted with situations, gosh, you hate to feel badly about making a mistake because at the end of the day I think making a mistake is an opportunity to learn and draw from that. It's experience.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Steve Robert:
And we all have experience which means we've all experienced failure.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely. Can you tell me a little bit about, give me just the nature of what that conversation looks like when your best boss ever is talking to you and you're really riled up about an issue. Just give me a little bit more detail. What is that conversation really look like?

Steve Robert:
Sure. I mean, I can think of a very good example where we had an account where it just meant a lot to us from a revenue perspective, things were not going well and it wasn't a result of our engagement, but as a result of some failures in terms of the equipment that we were providing this particular customer with. And I'll tell you, if you're leading sales and you're faced with this consequence of your biggest account threatening to leave, I was hot. And it was very simple, he just stayed so calm and said, "Okay, let's whiteboard this situation." And he took this very calm approach and current situation and drew out the path to the best possible outcome.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. That's awesome. Okay. So whiteboard, I'm making a note here because I love a whiteboard.

Steve Robert:
I do too. It's my friend. It's my friend.

Christine Laperriere:
I know. I've had quite many jokes about my obsessions with whiteboards. But that's brilliant. So he stayed very calm while you were extremely riled up and upset about the potential of losing this account. And then it sounds like the whiteboard gave him an opportunity to start to draw out what was in your head, what your concerns were, right?

Steve Robert:
It was exactly like that. But more importantly, it was for me to also gain some clarity from the whiteboard exercise. I was beginning to see that it wasn't as catastrophic as I thought, there was a way to fix it. Obviously no one wants to hear that your largest customer's upset and they're threatening to potentially leave you as a customer, no one wants that. But that whiteboard exercise, while it was important for him to draw out the facts, it was really therapeutic for me to see that there was a very clear path to overcome this. In the moment I didn't see it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Steve Robert:
And that's one of the great things that I learned from him. And I've really taken that to the next level as my career has moved on.

Christine Laperriere:
That is excellent. And that is such a good story, because again, I always say, it's how do we put it into motion? It's not just we need trust or we need good listening skills. Like, this is exactly how he listened. This is the tactical nature of how he listened. But also how he, I think he protected your engagement in the situation, which I think is important. Because just to say, "Hey Steve, just calm down, this isn't a big deal." He could have easily just said, "This isn't that big a deal. You're just riled up right now. Just calm down." But instead he didn't, he honored where you were at. And then he said, "Okay, let's work together so I can show you some clarity to where we're going"

Steve Robert:
That's exactly what he did. And as I said earlier, he did it for everyone he interacted with. And that's the powerful piece because he created a really dynamic and engaged team that was working in lockstep with one another. So there weren't any silos. And that was really important because as a leadership team, you're able to filter down or advocate team synergy. And team doesn't mean just your department. It means the entire company. It was incredibly important, a great lesson, because I've seen the alternative where it's not so great.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. You know, I think you bring up a really interesting point about the consistency of treating everyone the same way. Because it could have been easy for him to go "Oh, well here I have this very dynamic, very ambitious salesperson. I'm going to spend time nurturing them, but the rest of my team, maybe they're not worth the time." I've seen that a lot. Right?

Steve Robert:
Sure, sure. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Where we choose to be the best boss ever for our favorites and then save that energy from the rest and I'm hearing that that was not the case.

Steve Robert:
Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I mean, when you really kind of stop and think about this best boss ever concept, I can't even put a price tag on that as I evaluate. As I got prepared for this thinking about best boss ever versus alternatives, and there's just a clear difference in working for that best boss ever. I've learned from those experiences. And the big thing that I drew on this is the self-awareness piece and really striving to continuously learn from each experience because we're going to continually grow and run into new experiences. And it's being able to stop and reevaluate and really be self aware of how you dealt with the situation, how it could have been dealt with differently.

Christine Laperriere:
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Excellent. So do you have any stories, it doesn't have to be related to this one, but one where you worked for a leader and it was, we can gossip a little bit about maybe arguably, maybe a worse boss or maybe, in your world, not a favorite. Like a specific story or something that comes to mind when I think of those.

Steve Robert:
Yeah, for sure. I can definitely think of one and I think it's all the opposite of everything I talked about. It's disengaged. It's doing exactly, as you said, not really listening to the situations like it's not that bag go figure it out, that type of approach. Because you don't really need help at this level, you're our leader, you don't need help. And that type of mindset can really kind of diminish, I would say, team synergy, team productivity that alignment within the organization. And for me, it is just such a clear difference. Really makes it challenging to really kind of get your team focused on driving those results. When, gosh, you're not really working together at the top to cultivate this spirit of overcoming challenges.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. So when you see the silos in motion and you can't bring them down because the leaders aren't talking to each other. Right?

Steve Robert:
Very, very difficult. Very frustrating. And I think you hit on a very key point, it does create disengagement. As I thought about this last night, getting ready for this morning, I was like, "Wow." I remember feeling tired and unproductive and drained from that experience because I did care. And I did want to do really, really well for my team, for myself, for the organization. And I really kind of refer to that experience as a boss that was a diminisher if you will, a diminisher of what you're trying to accomplish.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. As soon as you say that, I think of leaders that I worked for, especially early in my career and I was so passionate and so committed to making that business the best business it could be. And it was just so interesting how many leaders were just like, "Oh, calm down, don't work so hard. You're taking this almost a little too seriously."

Steve Robert:
Yeah. And there's nothing worse than that when you really care. That's a terrible, terrible feeling when you really care and you hear that message. It's tough. It's tough.

Christine Laperriere:
So, okay. So just to summarize, if you were to offer a piece of advice for anybody that's listening right now, and they are truly committed to trying to be a best boss, what would you tell them? Like give them really tactical tips on what you would tell them to do next.

Steve Robert:
Yeah. First thing is, reflect. So what were your experiences? So let's really reflect on who your best boss was or is versus the alternatives that we just covered and really draw on that. And I think the second one is really be self aware of how you engage in situations. Because I think that's really important is being able to walk away from different situations and evaluate how you handled it. Did you do the best that you could? Especially if you're getting feedback that basically draws out opportunities for improvement, think about those things and really, really focus on them. That self-awareness piece, you can't put a price tag on that. And the third thing I'd say is solicit the feedback. I think it's really important that you encourage the feedback to come from team members, so same level, but also the people that report into you. That's really important to give them the confidence to want to speak up to you. Because that in itself is priceless. If you can create an environment where people feel comfortable to give you the straight good feedback, you will be by far a much better leader for it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. I think even given that too, I have to add in here, I really love your story about your best boss, who took a very calm approach when you were upset, but also did not deflect your emotion. Like I think there's something really emotionally intelligent about that response to an employee who's highly engaged, but is truly concerned at a very deep level and comes into the room and says "The sky is falling. The sky is falling." And without undermining your experience, he was able to stay rooted, walk you through the experience, teach you something really important about the experience, but never disengaging you or telling you that you shouldn't think or feel the way you did.

Steve Robert:
I totally agree. And just sitting here talking about this brings a smile to my face, because I work so hard trying to get to that place where I can be as calm and collected as he is and still is today. And again, that self-awareness journey is critically important. We got to learn from each situation. But it is unbelievable just thinking about how great he is at engaging with people and helping to overcome issues and the way he does it. His disposition just being so genuinely calm and really wanting to help you fix something. It's fantastic.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. What a great show. Thank you very much for those nuggets of wisdom. I'm smiling because I'm thinking already about where I can apply some of the things that you just talked about today. So I really enjoyed this chat, Steve, thank you so much for coming on the show.

Steve Robert:
Thanks Christine. It's always a pleasure.

Christine Laperriere:
All right. Have a good one. Take care.

Steve Robert:
Okay, you too.
