Guest: Gary Mottershead

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to The Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp. Welcome, Gary. I'm so excited to have you on the show. And just before we get started, why don't you do a quick intro?

Gary Mottershead:
Well, great. Thank you, Christine. You and I have really enjoyed the relationship that we've had and just a bit of background. I have been at work for a long time, a few decades now at this point, and I've started a couple of companies. So I'm president and founder of GCP Industrial Products. And the way that I know you is really through Strategic Coach. And I've been a coach for entrepreneurs for, I'm in my 25th year now. And a participant been in Strategic Coach for my 30th year. That's how we get to know each other. I have my own business, but also had the opportunity like you have to help other people grow and achieve their passions. That's Gary.

Christine Laperriere:
Perfect, and the reason that I thought you needed to be on The Best Boss Ever podcast was because I get the impression from our relationship that you've not only got an incredible history of working as a leader and working for a number of different leaders, but also the fact that today you actually coach and mentor a number of different leaders through the Strategic Coach program. Really the mission of this podcast is to extract those amazing stories about those leaders who are the best bosses ever. And I felt like there was a high probability that you would've either worked for some of them and, or coached and mentored some as well. So thank you so much. And I would just say, even just for starters, who is your best boss ever? Can you think of a leader that you worked for like that?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, you sent some notes out to begin with and I had a look at it and I'm going to say part of it was a challenge. And the sense of the challenge is that I've been on my own for more than 30 years. And so I think one of the reasons that I did that is I learned a lot about being bosses and some of them not so good and some of them good. And an interesting thing was a boss that I remember really well was when I joined DuPont and I'd come out of Imperial Oil, the Exxon Organization, and I went into industrial sales for the first time. I hadn't done that before, but I wanted to try it. And this was a grizzly older guy and it kind of hit one unibrow across here.

Gary Mottershead:
His name was Doug Hager. I walked into a brand new thing, I'm a young guy, and all wet behind the ears, so to speak. And I'm going into sales and he'd certainly been there all along, sales manager, and that's where he was going to be in his career. He wasn't going to go any further. And one of the things I really appreciated about Doug, he was tough on me. But in a kind way, if you can accept that sort of way is that he made sure, but he also allowed me to be myself. And just to put a little bit of a story together. I followed a guy who was totally well respected. His name was John Thode and at that point in DuPont I was in the plastics division and we were selling products made in the US.

Gary Mottershead:
Most of the division up there was working all in the Canadian made products. But there's a few of us at the US stuff. So we had to work with the US. And that's how I learned. I mean I've spent my whole life working in the United States. And this is where I first learned how to do that. But Doug was one of those guys who just allowed me to be me. And so when I was following this other gentleman, who'd done that job for 12 or 13 years, totally respected. I had to go across Canada. He was totally bilingual, and I wasn't. And I remember a couple of incidents that we were down in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and we're going in to have lunch. And I come into the restaurant after Doug and I was totally sheepish. And he goes, "What's up?"

Gary Mottershead:
I said, "Well, I locked the keys in the trunk." And I go, man, this has got to be what I later would call an SCI, serious career impediment. And at that point in time, so again, we had a rental car, whatever, how do you get to it? And you had locked, and they weren't all electronic things as you had now, because this is way back and that would've been what, I joined DuPont in anyway in early '90s, whatever case was. Anyway, but I remember taking out the back seat of the car, taking out the back part of the seat of the car. And I was small enough that I could get through the crossbars and reach in to get the keys in the car. And he just let me do all of this stuff. And I go, you know what?

Gary Mottershead:
That was the best thing he could have done. He let me be me. He let me make the mistakes. He supported me. And the thing that I learned, you talked about that he wasn't well respected in the organization.

Christine Laperriere:
Really?

Gary Mottershead:
He was not well respected because I think, because when you ask this question, what I found in corporations, in corporate is that you had to be really upward serving and not downward saving. So upward serving is that you looked after your boss, you didn't necessarily look after people.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay.

Gary Mottershead:
And you spent more time in large organizations. I spent about 10 years and that was enough for me to do that. And I found that. So, but he looked after me and he was not the kind of guy, he was gruff and always wasn't the neatest one. So he didn't fit the whole corporate mold to do all that. And dealing with the US, I know you're an American, I was born an American. You have to have a particular way that you go about doing that. And you ruffle the feathers, they don't need to know that you've ruffled the feathers so to speak, you know?

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And he couldn't do that because he was his own guy and he eventually retired out there. But what was really great it was the first time that I had ventured into the sales side of things and out of the, what more protected corporate world that I was in at Imperial Oil. And no longer being just an engineer, but being in sales and I look back upon that time and that was a really formative time. I mean, that really set the direction for me because I was not meant to be in the corporate world for, and talk about bosses. I always felt that I knew better than my bosses and that doesn't go over very well.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, well, and sometimes what do we do? It is what it is. But no, this is interesting. I'm just kind of rehashing the story because it's very interesting to me. It wasn't so much, you don't remember him so much for him, his softness sounds like again, he had kind of that hard edge, but he allowed you to be you. And then also I thought of what you said here about he wasn't upward serving. He was actually, he didn't play the political game necessarily upwards, but it sounded like he was really there for you as you were trying to transition. And he gave you space to make that transition, which is really interesting. That makes him a very memorable boss in your career.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, absolutely. Because when you look at bosses is that it's got to mean something to you, not just for them. And I mean to me, that's what a best boss is all about. That they're looking out for your world and for their world. And I don't know what you'll find as you go through the other people that you interview. You'll certainly find some common characteristics and common traits, but I would suspect from the people that I've coached over, it's those who say, who really understand what the other person needs to have. And it's no different than life. And you're married, I'm married to our partners. We have to understand, it's a similar kind of situation. And so that's really the important part.

Gary Mottershead:
If we're thinking all about us, that's all about me. You can be as smart as you want. You can be as intelligent as anything, but people aren't going to relate to you.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
What are they going to relate to? They're going to relate to what you do for them. And I don't care what aspect of life that is. And so that's what I've learned. And that's what I really picked up through all of this. And I learned those that would accept cause even at DuPont, I had people who I knew very smart who did things, but I had to disagree with them. And disagreeing with a boss is not a good thing in a corporation, because it doesn't matter, okay? It doesn't, it's not their money. What do they have to say?

Gary Mottershead:
What do they have to do? And so if I can give you another little story, which you'd probably find cute on the opposite side. Doug was a sales manager and Doug worked for a gentleman who was the vice president of Plastics. And so in their wisdom, they gave the United Way campaigns, if you recall those to some of the young guys. And so the goal in the organization that we'd have 80% participation. You put up those thermometer charts, right? Down in the hallways and everything else. Everybody's in the hallways. We're down in the Toronto Dominion Center, 27th floor of the Toronto Dominion Center, so it's big group people. And so I had the thermometer chart and we keep getting up there. And the vice president would report to the president how his division in plastics was a pretty big division.

Gary Mottershead:
And so it got to the point that he told the president, he had 80% participation, everything else. And then he comes down the next week and the chart's up to 100%. He tells the president, he's got 100% participation. He feels really good. It was a big deal. So the next week comes in, we're at 110%. He comes storming down to my office. He was a big man. And said, Gary, "How can we be at 110%?" I said, "The goal was 80%. We've overachieved the 80% goal for the corporation." He was furious. Absolutely furious because the goal was 80%. That was 100% achievement to me.

Christine Laperriere:
Okay, hang on a second. Explain this to me. You guys blew the number out of the water.

Gary Mottershead:
What we did was, the goal of the corporation was to have 80% of the people participate.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
To me, achieving the goal was 100%.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
So when we got to 80%, the thermometer chart read 100%. He told the president that he had 100% of his whole division participating.

Christine Laperriere:
Got it.

Gary Mottershead:
And then the next week he comes back and it's 110% and he's absolutely furious.

Christine Laperriere:
And now he is mad because right, you're over the 80%, which was the original target, the 100% of the target.

Gary Mottershead:
I realized sometimes that my way of looking at things was not the way everybody else was going to look at things.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, go ahead.

Christine Laperriere:
No, and I'm curious, as a leader, when you were working for Doug, how do you think he handled that?

Gary Mottershead:
Well, Doug kind of loved it because I would always challenge the authority and only if I felt I was right. It wasn't just for challenging it. And I can think of several instances when I did that, but I also realized that I wasn't then made for that world because you being an individual. So the other part about being a good boss is understanding the people and who they are as individuals.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And relating to those individuals and what they need. And so being equal to everybody is not necessarily fair because people need different things at different times. And different trainings, different attention. And so when I go back and I think about that, I always thought of Doug very fondly in that he really helped me along.

Gary Mottershead:
Not because he was the smartest guy, because he wasn't necessarily. He was a survivor in an organization and he also then accepted what his role was going to be. But instead of taking it out, some people when they get to their level and that's it, as far as they're going to go, they take out their frustrations on other people. And oftentimes it's the people that work for them, but Doug didn't do that. And so he really mentored me along in that respect.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, which is two years into 10 years that I spent in corporations. I spent the next eight years at DuPont and then it was time to move on.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, then one of the questions I'd love to ask just for comparison, you don't have to name names, but worst boss ever. Or one that stands out in your mind as having made an impact on you from even poor leadership judgment. What was that like?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, there's a couple. The one that I mentioned, I'll give another story, but there's another one early on. And it's just, when you could tell that people weren't being honest. There was dishonesty about them and they may have been, and I saw this more those who were in more the, what I'll call more the sales side of things and particularly going back like 30 plus years now. And it was a different world than it is today. Being an engineer by training. But just to see what that part of the world could get away with. And then when they were made into managers and management, they kind of tried to do the same thing. Still looking out for themselves, being upward serving, but not really being honest. And we could see right through that and everybody pays lip service to it because they're in a position of responsibility, but there's not a lot of following.

Gary Mottershead:
There's not a lot of feeling and camaraderie around let's rally around and work together. It kind of puts everybody off on their own. And the same thing happened with that gentleman who was the vice president is that I had certain feelings about customers that we have. And I remember, and he was a big man. He was about twice my size. And I remember being in a meeting one day with him, with customers and I'd known a bit about these customers that he didn't, and he was telling me that these guys were right. And I knew they weren't. And I told him in front of him that they weren't right. And that was the beginning of the end at DuPont. Cause I said what, it meant nothing to me except that my own integrity.

Gary Mottershead:
And so I looked at it and said, when you talk about best bosses, I think there are things you learn from your bosses. And I think some of the ones that aren't that good also are actually really good bosses.

Christine Laperriere:
Teachers.

Gary Mottershead:
Because we have to learn in life what not to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
You know? And you can tell, cause this goes back a long time as I've been more than 30 years now. Those are the things have stuck with me in those 10 years that I was there. There were a few others of course that I did appreciate. But when I look back over it now, the ones that I appreciated all really cared. They cared about people. They genuinely were looking out for your livelihood as well as their livelihood. And when you're in a corporation, that's a hard balance to have.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
And balance both of those as you would've seen. So you either look upward and so you can move upward and have upward mobility. Or if you look downward, it probably keeps you from getting upward. So it has a double edged sword to it.

Christine Laperriere:
Interesting. But if we were to give a nugget for someone out there right now who is trying to be a best boss ever, right? They are very committed to their people and being fantastic leaders. What I'm hearing is this focus on not just upward serving, but also downward serving and the ability to balance, really understanding what other people need. But this isn't just what they need to get work done. This is what they need at a personal level to feel like they're contributing and really enjoying the work that they're doing.

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah, it's a good question. Good thought to that. And what I've learned over the time is that you can do both of those things. You can, and a really good boss to me is one who figures out how to get the best out of everybody, and really allows them to grow. And as they grow, because that's what people want today. I know you're a little younger than I am. And I look back over the generations, I have children in their 30s now. And so what do they want, what do they need? Everybody appreciates someone who helps them grow. And then there's an attachment to all of that. Well, if the boss is smart, the boss realizes as the people below him grow, he gets to grow, and he gets to do it.

Gary Mottershead:
That's the really smart thing. And so I think today, and I think particularly we're in the kind of world that we're in right now that we're all operating off of Zoom and in virtual world. I think there's more opportunity to do that. Christine, I really think that.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah.

Gary Mottershead:
Instead of having to play the politics. And I love it when I go to Strategic Coach and Dan says, the CEOs don't really like this because their box is the same size as everybody else's box on the TV. And they don't have any hierarchy of position or anything like that. All the trappings of the world have gone. Well, now it's up to you. If you're authentic and you care and you help them grow, they'll help you grow.

Gary Mottershead:
And there can be a lot to that, but I try and simplify things down and said now how you get it all done is more complicated. But those are the things that I break it down to. And I think that's where today, when you're talking about the nugget, that people have got in the kind of world that we're going to operate in, regardless of whether, how long the pandemic continues or not, we're still going to be in this, in this virtual world environment. Those that can relate across this environment. Those that can and get other people motivated and going are the ones that are going to be the true and the best bosses and the great leaders in my opinion.

Christine Laperriere:
Great, thank you. That is perfect. That is exactly what I know so many of us want to hear that right now because we need to get focused on new sets of leadership skills in a way for this new way of working. It's a completely different game now. Thank you so much for that. Do you have anything else you want to add just as we bring this to a close?

Gary Mottershead:
Yeah. I'd say you need to evolve. You need to continue to evolve. And I think you can bring the sets of skill that we had at the beginning of 2020 into 2021 where we are now. I think you can bring those. And the key thing is now you have to figure out how to operate, what I'll call facing the camera, as opposed to behind the camera. And those of us like you, Christine, or I who have been presenting and presenting for quite a while. I've had to figure that out. Otherwise, you wouldn't survive. And that's how to be authentic with that. And the authenticity comes from making sure that as one person told me, when I first started to coaching, they said, Gary, I see two people at the front of the room.

Gary Mottershead:
I see you and I see the program. Those two have to come together. So the key is that there's no hiding when we have a Zoom, there's no hiding. You see everybody, you get to see everything. It's actually quite intimate because you see everybody's face a lot closer than you would if you're in a room, especially if you're in a room with multiple people. So as a result of that, you have to learn how to be authentic. Once you're authentic now, and people get that. Now you've got everybody following and you can lead. If you keep trying, and so I put it this way. There's a difference between performing and acting. And performing is getting better at being yourself and acting is trying to be somebody else.

Christine Laperriere:
Right.

Gary Mottershead:
We need to learn how to perform in these situations. So what does the people that you're with need? What does the organization need to help you do that? And then perform to the best of your abilities? My next door neighbor up in Collingwood was saying, Gary, I know I told him what I was doing as coach for people says, I have real trouble speaking. [inaudible 00:20:50] I'm a CFO for a company out west. And so I was all on Zoom and I happened to know something about that. He was an awesome racer, ski racer. And so I said to him said, Greg, what did you do to prepare for a race? Did you do the same as if your training race? No, I said, then you have to prepare. So to be at your best, you have to prepare for any of your presentations, such as you would prepare for if you're doing your race and you're going to go race downhill, you have to put it in the same context.

Gary Mottershead:
He was still Greg, whether he was training or whether he was racing, but there was a different intensity. There was a different way. And he was excellent and he was excellent that he still does the adult racing and that sort of thing. But he couldn't see how the two related. So you have to look at your own life and say, where did I have to perform at my best? And what did I have to do that? And in a team, that's the same thing. As a boss, what do I have to do to be at my best for them and for them to be able to be at their best. And I think if you do that part of it. So it's not so self-serving, it'll actually serve you very well as the boss. You'll serve the organization, but also serve the people that you work with.

Christine Laperriere:
Right, excellent. Thank you so much. And again, we're just thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.

Gary Mottershead:
My pleasure. And I wish you all the best with this, as I know you'll do really well. But it's an exciting project. I think it's really worthwhile right now, too, because people are struggling to figure out what's next for them.

Christine Laperriere:
Yeah, absolutely. If you want to hear more, join me@christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.
