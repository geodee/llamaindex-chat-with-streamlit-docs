Host: Christine Laperriere
Guest: Laura Joudrey

Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader in Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged, and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that changed the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whip.

Christine Laperriere:
So welcome. I am so excited to have Laura Joudrey on the show today. And I just have to start by explaining why I invite each guest on the show. And I had a recent conversation with Laura, and as we were just getting to know each other, she was telling me a little bit about Extend Communications, where she works. And she really had my attention when she started talking about how she's been part of this organization and they've been really focused on creating a great culture. Then she went on to tell me that they also have incredibly low turnover, which is interesting because this business is based around a call center. So I've had some experience with call centers in the past and by nature, that role can be very demanding for individuals.

Christine Laperriere:
And typically it's a high turnover environment. So when she was mentioning this idea of there being great culture, that was very intentionally created and how low the turnover was. I was so curious to learn more that I asked her to come on the show and not only tell us a little bit about your best boss, but tell us a bit about how your organization has been able to accomplish these things. So thank you so much for being on the show, Laura.

Laura Joudrey:
Oh, thank you for inviting me. Again, yes, I'm Laura, and I work for Extend Communications. My title there is CFO and I've worked for 19 years and I love my job.

Christine Laperriere:
I always get excited when I hear someone say they love their job, that you just triggered too a memory because I think you said that when we were talking too, I know you said, "Oh, I, I have to know more." So I'll start by the first question which we always love to start with is to first tell me a little bit about your best boss ever and/or bosses.

Laura Joudrey:
I have had actually two best bosses. They both have really shaped not just my professional life, but my personal life as well. So the first was when I first started actually back in the workforce, full-time after having a family, and this boss was a controller of a large US corporation, which was a very competitive corporation. He gave me an opportunity that I probably wasn't qualified to do, but he had confidence in me. And I think from him, he really encouraged me down the path that my career took today. But more than that, he was so interested and about my success and how I was doing. The thing. I remember the very most about him and that I have always tried to practice in what I do in my career is he was so super busy.

Laura Joudrey:
And every time I wrapped on his door to have a question or I didn't understand something, he was swamp with papers, just piled everywhere on his desk and he would just put them aside and he'd go sit down, and I had his undivided attention every time. He made me feel like I was the most important person, that I was valued, and that what I had to say mattered, and that I deserve to be listened to. That is something that I've taken away with me in my personal life and in my professional life. And I've tried to do it with my kids. I've tried to do it with the people that I work with. Of course, my husband might say, that's not quite true, but he might be the only one that complains about it. But I always do, try to focus when somebody's talking to me. And that's what I took away from that best boss ever.

Laura Joudrey:
And he was great. He was a great person to work with. So my second boss, best boss ever is, of course, why I love my job today, and the owner of Extend Communications, Scott Lyons. There's a million reasons why he's the best boss ever to me and I think to everyone else that works there. First and foremost, I think that he motivates and inspires everyone around him to share a vision for his company that is all inclusive and that creates an incredible culture where, where everyone can enjoy coming to work. That's the goal, love your job, enjoy coming to work, have everything that you need to accomplish and be successful at your job, but even more than that, to be able to grow, and not just grow within the company, the company is growing and has been growing for years and years, and people have an opportunity to move and grow within the company.

Laura Joudrey:
But it goes beyond that, you can use Extend as a stopping ground. You have other aspirations, you have other goals, you have other things you want, other potential, other things you want to do in your life. And it's just his ability to keep you in a job, but to still pursue your dreams or your desires or whatever, and use us as a stopping ground. And even in that, you get the best that people have to offer because you're a part of their development and what they want. So that's basically the culture. The culture also depends very much on excellent communication. And I would say, first and foremost, also on trust, trusting the people that you work with, trusting that the whole aspect of the company.

Christine Laperriere:
So can I ask you some questions? This is great. I love hearing this. So when you think of Scott, if I was to follow him around for a day, tell me how he makes it, number one, known that it's okay to have a fun to like your job or, how does he inspire that enjoying your job so much? And then I'm also curious, how does he inspire trust?

Laura Joudrey:
He inspires you to like your job because he truly cares and is compassionate in how you do your job and what makes you successful in your job. And he's got open lines of communications and he talks to all the employees. An example would be when we all remotely, it was a huge undertaking. We already had remote staff already. So we'd been there and we knew what that looked like, but it's just a matter of moving 80 to 85 people all into a remote environment and making sure that they are able to continue to work and the business is still up and running. So that was a huge undertaking for the senior leadership team, for Scott, for the employees, for everyone. And after that was all done, Scott made it his mission to contact every single employee, contact every employee and say, how's it going?

Laura Joudrey:
How are you feeling? How's life treating you? How are you feeling emotionally? How's this affecting you? Is your family okay? Do you have the tools you need to work with? How's your job? Are you able to do what you want and do you have any problems? Tell me what your problems are. Is there anything I can do to help? And he contacted every single employee. And so that is an example of how he just leads by example, really, by showing that you care and that it's important.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. That's amazing. So I wondered how long it took him to call.

Laura Joudrey:
It took a while.

Christine Laperriere:
I mean, that's got to be incredible amount. Now, was that 80 employees or he called everybody that was also working from home or just the 80 that...

Laura Joudrey:
We have a total staff of around 80 to 84 people and he contacted every person. He touched base with every person. And then as a senior leadership team, we met every single day. We kept in touch with our direct reports as well and we the communication was always there, but it was just that extra. And it does. It takes a lot of time and just sitting back and having the time to even just chat.

Christine Laperriere:
And I mean, we always get into this debate sometimes about, what is the impact to the bottom line? Companies are always asking if we should be putting dollars and cents into our people because what is the impact to the bottom line? If you could describe, what do you think the impact was? Even if it couldn't be measured financially, what do you think the impact of that type of practice does?

Laura Joudrey:
Well, I can tell, like just from the feedback that we got and the impact was wow. This person actually cares, not just about the job, not just about that I didn't miss a beat. I continued to answer because I was sent home at such and such a time and it wasn't even that. It was that he actually cared enough to make sure I was okay, and that everything was going fine for me. That in itself, everything... And I must also say that we have an intranet, like a forum post and he was constantly communicating with employees through the forum post, just to give how quickly things were changing and just to make sure everyone was updated. And those two things made people feel safe and they made them feel connected and they made them feel valued and cared about. And I think that that's invaluable in any way you look at it, not just the loyalty that you create but just the sense of wellbeing and the sense of family or whatever you want to call it.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. That feeling that we're going to get through this together.

Laura Joudrey:
Exactly. It was always a together thing. And regardless of what obstacles may come in their path, some of it was crazy times, but we managed just fine and we managed because we had an amazing team behind us that was a coherent team that moved forward. And even with the blips that came through and whatever happened, we were moving forward as a team. And everybody was aware of what was going on. There was full transparency and you just had that feeling that things were going to be okay. Do you know what I mean?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Well, but if you think about it, if you're having a direct dialogue with the leader of the business, the highest leader of the business and you're able to feel comfortable, that that person sees you and cares about you and is thinking about you while they're trying to navigate this crisis, I would imagine from an employee engagement and rail standpoint, people show up for you. They want to follow you.

Laura Joudrey:
Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
I love that. Any other things that you observe about Scott's leadership that are particularly different or unique?

Laura Joudrey:
I think his leadership is, and I guess, different... Just prio to working for Extend, I had worked for a lot of small businesses. And I do know, as you say, the bottom line is everything and that's what motivates people. I get the sense with Scott that that's not... Obviously the bottom line matters because you have to have a viable business in order to succeed and be profitable and employ people and do good things for them. But his motivation is to make a better life for everyone. And then that broadens out to the community as well. He's very involved in the community and we do a lot of community work. He personally does a lot of community work and along with the business, we do a lot of community work. He's just always looking for ways to increase the employee experience.

Laura Joudrey:
And in that way, it follows through to the customer experience because when you have a happy employee, who likes their job motivated to do a good job, that all goes down. So as our scores for our customers come in, they've been increasing and so is the employee side as well. And so it's all just this tiered effect that just works. But I think at the very base of the whole thing is a genuine since your desire to improve people's lives. And I really do.

Christine Laperriere:
I get a big smile when you say that because the entire reason, like the inspiration behind this show, Best Boss Ever is that I believe as leaders, we're not just responsible for the bottom line, number one. And I do believe that if I took every leader out there and somehow was able to inspire them to be a better boss, to those that they lead, we would actually improve the happiness and success ratio of everyone.

Laura Joudrey:
That's true. That's true.

Christine Laperriere:
Many of us who have worked for a bad boss know how miserable our lives can be when we're working for a bad boss. And even not a bad boss but even just how a mediocre boss, it's fine. We'll get there. But when you work for a best boss, you just see the energy and the enthusiasm of everyday people. And like you said, it improves the quality of their life.

Laura Joudrey:
It really does. It really does. And I know that even examples, like we have grown over the last few years. We grow partially by acquisition. And when we're in that spot, he'll take the senior leadership and he'll go, "Okay, this is what's on the plate. How do you feel about it? Do you think...?" It's always a dialogue. There's always a dialogue. There's always input. He takes input and suggestions from all areas and then base his decisions that everyone contribute.

Christine Laperriere:
So it sounds like he demonstrates a lot of inclusivity too.

Laura Joudrey:
Absolutely. Absolutely.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Yeah. Well, I'm just curious too, when you talk about turnover being low, especially in an environment that's typically high turnover, I'm curious, has anybody ever done the math on even what that could be financially to the business? Because if you're training people constantly, you know what I mean? And you're constantly onboarding new faces, that's got to be quite a heavy, heavy load for the business.

Laura Joudrey:
And that's exactly it is. We do a turnover rate every year and we evaluate what the turnover was particularly with new hires. And I know years and years ago, when you're still growing and we had a higher turnover and we're training these people, the cost of training people and evaluating how many are lasting the three months, how many lasting six months or a year, and the cost involved of losing somebody within that space of time. So basically, for each employee, it's a good 15,000, at least in order to get them through their first three months. And that's the training and the time and their time. And then to lose them, it, it costs so much and that's what made the big difference with us.

Laura Joudrey:
It's also analyzing that and understanding the types of people that we want to hire. We were just not hiring the correct people. And when we really delved into that and getting our culture, the kind of culture, the kind of place we wanted to be, the kind of people and family atmosphere we wanted to have, and we started being more discriminating on in the sense of a cultural fit rather than other kinds of fit. And once we started doing that and then really supporting people through the training and that it was all those aspects of it as well.

Christine Laperriere:
So you're hiring more for cultural fit, which has become an improvement in the way that the whole organization functions. And then I'm also hearing, you said even stronger support in those early days when you're transferring them.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes, that's a huge part too is figuring out where the support is, figuring out why people were failing, why they weren't being successful and why they were getting frustrated or whatever the case may be. And then going from that and not even with new hires, but as you go down the road and you're putting on new clients, there's all kinds of differences between clients and the way that you would answer for them and just maintain training all the way through that when you're putting on these more difficult clients and that kind of thing.

Christine Laperriere:
Which is interesting because when I think back to so many different groups I've worked with, when people leave the organization, they have a tendency to blame it on the person who left.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
But what I'm hearing you say is that we actually sit down and try to figure out why that person wasn't successful. So taking accountability for the fact that maybe you didn't set them up for success in some way and that there's an opportunity there, that's some pretty big insight.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes. And that's exactly the way we look at it, that if we can't build a culture and in an environment that people are excited to come to work, are motivated to come to work, feel like they're valued and appreciated if somebody leaves, or for whatever reason, we want to know why actually we want to know way before they would ever leave to have a dialogue with them and figure it out because the real goal is to create an environment where everybody is happy to come to work, motivated to do what they do to the best of their ability, has an opportunity grow and just loves to come to work every day. We don't want people that don't want to come to work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. Right. Yeah. And what a great way to create the cultural fabric of people who are engaged. And people forget... I always say this culture's so interesting because culture, you can't taste it or touch it, but people mirror each other. So if you have that requirement for highly engaged people, as in you're creating the environment to make sure that they feel that it's a place that they want to be highly engaged, again, that can carry a lot of weight. So just when you're seeing your team members engaged in the job and feeling good, you're so much more likely to emulate that than if everybody around you is slogging.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes.

Christine Laperriere:
That is fantastic. I am really enjoying this. Do you have any other insights that you'd like to share for everybody, especially as leaders are listening to this interview today and they're trying to think of how they can improve their own leadership capability??

Laura Joudrey:
I think for us, we have a great senior leadership team and we all share the same vision. We all share the same goal. And because we have that strategy and everything, I have to say from Scott, it's really a strategy that works from the top down as I think any good strategy does. I mean, you can't have it any other way where it's going to work and be effective. And I think it's something that is so rewarding. It's so, so very rewarding and fulfilling to be able to, I don't want to say, give back, but to be able to help and to make an environment where people feel that they can do a great job, the best job that they can, where they're always supported and supporting each other, and they're just working as a team, as one.

Laura Joudrey:
And it sounds difficult perhaps but I know that every single year, when you do your year end and your financials come out, we sit as a leadership team together and we go, "Oh, okay. Now what can we do this year? What can we add that's going to make it better for everyone? And it's just trying to get that aspect of everything so that we're constantly adding. And not just that, but we're getting feedback from everyone. So we're not arbitrarily adding things that perhaps people don't really even care about. We want to know what you want, what you need, what you feel is lacking, what would make it better or how we can change or any feedback you have whatsoever. That's going to make it a better place to work. And I think it's worked out well because I believe we have an exceptional place to work and a very happy workspace.

Christine Laperriere:
Now I just have to ask you one more question because you caught my attention. But when you were talking about, what do we need to add when you get that feedback from your group, I'm just curious, what things are you adding as a response to that team or what are the types of feedback that you get?

Laura Joudrey:
Usually what we are adding when we're talking about that is we're adding things that we can give back to the employees or things that we can add to the employees. By that, I would mean... So one we implemented a wellness fund. So we said, "Okay, every employee is going to get $300 a year, like some five a quarter. They can get their hair done. They can get their nails done. They can do whatever makes them go to the gym, buy that piece of equipment that they've been wanting to." So we added that one year. Another is we have a great professional development plan. So we support anyone who wants to grow. If they're doing it for professional development, that's going to enhance their job or move them up to another position, we pay for it 100%.

Laura Joudrey:
We also have a personal... So if you're a student going to university, we also have a funding for that. So you can get up to $1,000, we pay 50% of your tuition up to a thousand and books up to $1,000. If you wanted to take a pottery course, we would pay half of that, whatever you feel like, music, lesson, a music court, whatever.

Christine Laperriere:
Wow.

Laura Joudrey:
We will support you in doing that. And other things that we've done is we've enhanced benefit programs. We've enhanced a performance bonus program. Every year, there's something that we try to add that will just enhance the culture, and health, and wellness. This year, we added a mental health program where people can access mental health providers get support. They can do an assessment. There's all kinds of mental health because that's been a huge thing as well with the remote work and the pandemic and every else. So those are the examples that-

Christine Laperriere:
Wow. Okay. So I have really enjoyed this interview. What I love hearing too, even those examples, those are real investments. I hear so many companies, they want to improve the workplace, but at no cost. So I get a lot of calls where people say, we're trying to make all these big improvements, but we don't want to spend a dime. So we're trying to do it off the side of our desk but I always say, it shows that there's not a prioritization of it. If we wouldn't put any investment to it but what I'm hearing here, I mean, every example you've stated, these are real investments. They're not just talk.

Laura Joudrey:
Yes, that's right. This was so much fun for me, especially because I have an absolute love and passion for hearing about what the best boss ever do. And I love to hear how companies are creating these really one of a kind workplace that people aspire to stay at and be happy. So thank you. This was very informative and I hope that this was great for our listeners as well.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank You, Laura.

Laura Joudrey:
Well, thank you very much for having me, Christine.
