We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me @christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Hello, Tanya. And thank you so much for joining me on the show. I'm so glad to have you here. Now, I'm just going to start by saying why I invited you into the show. So I am getting this opportunity to work with you on the advancement of women. It's a large initiative, and I just love the insight and wisdom that you have from so many years of working in different parts of the organization and moving your career. And some of the stories that you tell and some of the insights that you have, I just find so fascinating, and so inspiring. So I had to have you on the Best Boss Ever Show. So thank you so much for joining me.

Tonya Campbell:
Oh, thanks for having me, Christine. It's a real pleasure to be here today.

Christine Laperriere:
And just so everybody knows, can you do a quick introduction?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. A quick introduction. So my name is Tanya Campbell. I am a regional vice-president for mobile financial planning team within Scotiabank. And I've been with the bank for, coming on to 25 years. So lots of experiences with bosses, I think in that 25 years, probably over a dozen roles. So that's over a dozen bosses and probably lots to share.

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely. Well, that's why I just want to dive in. So, again, of those dozen bosses you would've seen and learned so much. So when you think back about some of the ones that stand out as your best boss ever, who comes to mind and why?

Tonya Campbell:
So I would say there's a few of them and, without calling out names, the ones that really stand out for me share very, very common characteristics amongst them. And it's easy enough to just say, they trusted me, they gave me autonomy, they gave me some flexibility to do my job the way I needed to do it. I think the real issue is, you have to talk about specifically what those things mean, but I would say that the ones that come top of mind did offer me trust, flexibility, autonomy, and the trust was probably the number one at the very, very top of it all.

Christine Laperriere:
So if you were to describe for so many of us, what does trust look like in motion? When you're working for a boss and you know, that is there. Tell us exactly what does that look like?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to describe, but I would use the words or I would use the analogy they have my back, and you only really know what you have my back means when you experience it. And for me, I think the best way to describe specific example would be there was a time when I was running a project, very high stakes projects, my perspective anyways across the bank. And you always know, especially over time as you develop through your career, you know which ones are high stakes, you know when there's people who are talking or meeting about certain topics behind the scenes.

Tonya Campbell:
And when you have somebody who has your back, you know that when things aren't always going well, because let's face it, not everything goes perfect a hundred percent of the time or, conversely, it could be going perfectly fine, but you will always have stakeholders who view things differently.

Tonya Campbell:
And for me, it was always knowing, or it was knowing that when those differences of opinions or perspectives were happening, that my leader was 100% always on my side. So if things were being said or done that were making them feel like maybe perhaps the stakeholders or the person that's sharing the opinion, if it didn't really seem like it was coming off in my favor, I knew that they would use words like, let me check into that.

Tonya Campbell:
And it was not ever about siding with what was going on or feeding into that. And the reason I knew that was because that boss would come back to me and say, "Hey, what's going on?" And they would give me the opportunity to share my perspective first and then in a very safe way go, "Here's what was said. And let's talk through that."

Tonya Campbell:
And so, it always felt like they gave me the benefit of the doubt first before feeding into any sort of negative dialogue or what have you. And that's just one example, I can think of. I'm drawing on that experience as we talk about without giving away the project. But that very specific example, I knew because there was multiple times where there was things that appearances from other people that it didn't look like it was going so well, but that boss always came to me. And honestly the person I report to right now, I have that exact same feeling. It doesn't matter what the initiative is. I know that that person trusts me and I got to tell you the other part, the other tangible thing that comes from feeling trust is that you feel braver.

Tonya Campbell:
You feel more okay to take risks, you feel more okay to take control, to make decisions because you're not fearing any of the ramifications. And I know there were times when in my current role where perhaps I had to make a judgment call and wasn't exactly sure if it was the right judgment call, but because I felt safe and I felt trust, I made the decision and I knew that the call even if it was a bad call, that the discussion with a leader would have been okay, let's walk through that. Why did you make that decision? And that could have been a learning experience rather than a beat up experience. So that's a couple of experiences I've had.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the way that you point out when you work for a leader that trusts you, you feel braver. So what do you think feeling braver actually does for your development?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. I mean, you take risks and I think risk taking is what makes you grow and it's okay. When you're an environment of trust and that trust breeds risk, then you know that there is outcome that is bad if you take the risk and it's successful. Yay, because winning breeds winning or whatever phrase you want to use. Success breeds success, winning breeds winning. But when you're in a safe environment and you have trust, if you fail, you know that it's going to be seen as something that you're learning from and how you're going to do better next time. And so, it's a win-win outcome, whether it's a win or whether it's a fail.

Tonya Campbell:
And you know that when you're in that environment, I think that you can also know that when you're not in that environment, because if you're feeling constrained, if you're feeling like you can't make up decision, if you're feeling like, "Oh my God, I don't want to do that, because I'm going to get in trouble," then you're going to know in that with a great boss because you're not empowered. So the exact opposite is also true.

Christine Laperriere:
And I just going to bring this up because this is one of my passion topics, but what does it do for your stress level too? When you look at the difference between working for someone who says, "Don't worry about it, I've got your back to take risks," versus when you're working for someone and you don't have that safety or that security.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. It's the difference between thriving and surviving. And honestly, when I think about the rules that I've been in, where I'm thriving, it's because I've got trust in that environment. And surviving has been in situations where like, I need to outlive this person or this group where there is no trust and surviving is, I'm going to do just what I need to do today to get to tomorrow and get to the next day until I'm finding myself somewhere else. So it is literally the difference between thriving and surviving.

Tonya Campbell:
Christine, I have peers and people who come to me for advice all the time on navigating their career, where they should go, what they should do, how have I navigated it. And some of the things that I share with them, obviously like there's networking and relationship currently is a big topic you and I have discussed at length lately.

Tonya Campbell:
But I always say to them, when you are doing that, when you're going through that process, be very careful because people can want to go like, I would love to work in this area, I'd love to work in technology or I would love to work in distribution leadership, or I would love to work in customer experience. And you could, you very well could. But you need to actually go and find out about the leadership and the environment there. And really what I'm getting at is the level of trust is not, you do need to ... Obviously you're almost like, people think about, "Oh, I'm going to go, and I'm going to network with this leader. Because I want them to think about me for the next job."

Tonya Campbell:
I'm like, well, you might want to go there and think about whether you want them to be the leader for you at the next job. It is a two way street. And that reason I tell them is because you can love the work itself, what you're going to do. But if you don't love the boss, the person that you're reporting to and the people around you, which are often a function of the trust in that environment, then it doesn't work. You can let in, just as much as you can love the person and the colleagues and the environment around you. But if you hate the work, that's not going to work.

Tonya Campbell:
You need to find that balance of those two and that it really truly does come from, it starts with the boss, right? Because that is what creates that environment of trust. And so, I think there's some really cliche things about good bosses, which they provide trust. They empower, they give autonomy and all those good things. It's cliche for a reason, it's because it's true. Like when you get those things, you feel like you're in an environment where you can thrive and not survive.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. So one question I have for you while we're just closing this. So now that you're in a leadership position and you have people that are coming to you, when you think of autonomy, for example. So there's a high risk project and you could go ahead and say, "Hey, I'm going to let you run with it. I've got your back." But you know that there's personal consequence to you if they fail or they don't get it right. Or you might have to do it over, or you might have a lot of it could come down to you, people asking you, "Why didn't you manage this person, well?" How do you deal with that now that the roles are reversed.

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah. So then I guess that becomes the question of, well, how, like how do you become a good boss? How do you provide autonomy and authority? And it really boils down to communication because ultimately if I provide authority to somebody, but I haven't given them proper instruction, that's on me. I should be in trouble. If I'm the throat to choke and it fails, I should. But giving people authority and autonomy to do their job comes with, they have to have the right instruction. They have to know what the goal is. And so that has to come from me. So that is what is required of a good boss, is to start with providing the vision, the instruction, what you can, and can't do. Like you have to give them the guideposts of what they can work within.

Tonya Campbell:
And once they have that, then you let them go. That's how I look at it. And again, when I think back to those people who did that for me, who set the good example for me. They taught me what's my playground, what are the guardrails in which I can play in. And then I knew, okay, it's outside that. Well, I better seek guidance and authority because it's outside of those bounds. And so, yeah, it really boiled down to that, and communicating as often as possible.

Tonya Campbell:
So providing an open door policy so that if they're unsure, they can safely come and ask those questions and not feel like they're going to be admonished for it. So it's seeking to understand. So now that I'm not in the boss's shoes and I have a team under me, having their back is doing exactly what I just shared with you, which is when I hear something, I go, "Thanks very much for that information." And then I go to my direct report and I go, "Hey, what's going on?" Seek to understand first. We all know there's three sides to every story, right?

Christine Laperriere:
Absolutely.

Tonya Campbell:
It's really listening before you speak, it's listening and asking a lot of questions to get a good, deep understanding, listening to hear the answer, and not listening so you can respond. So I try to do and model all those things because they were the things that were done for me and worked for me and allowed me to thrive in my career.

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. And then I have to ask the question. We all know that we learn the most, sometimes from the worst boss we've ever had. And you don't have to name any names, but just when you think of those lessons, what did you learn from the people who weren't the best leaders or your favorite leaders?

Tonya Campbell:
Yeah, Christine, we did have a little bit of a preamble on this topic, and I think back to that, and the truth is, you can't have the good without the bad. How do you know what's good unless you also know what's bad and the bad also for those of you, those people who want to be good can take what happened in that situation and make themselves better, which makes you more good. So those experiences for me, when I think about those times, and obviously not naming any names, they were really, really hard experiences to have. And I've shared with you that analogy of the thriving versus surviving. So yeah, I did have a couple of times in my journey over the 25 years where I was surviving and not thriving.

Tonya Campbell:
And it was hard in that moment to think about it and, "Oh, what can I take away from this?" So no judgment, if you're in that moment or in that right now, and you can't take the good out of it, but I assure you when you get out on the other side, if you look back and you go, "What was it that was so painful?" For me, it was taking it and looking at it and saying, "I made make a commitment. I will never do that. I will never be that kind of a person, because I'm going to etch this in my memory, how awful that made me feel. And therefore I will not do that to somebody else."

Tonya Campbell:
And again, you talk about cliches, but the behaviors in those scenarios were almost the exact opposite of all of the things I just shared with you, which was, I didn't feel like I had trust. I felt like I didn't have autonomy. I had somebody who was over me constantly. Where's this? Where's that? Second request, third request, when maybe they didn't give you the instruction, which is what I just shared with you, which is key, right? I'm like, well, I didn't give it to you because you didn't tell me you needed it, right?

Tonya Campbell:
And so, it's lack of access, lack of clarity and the instruction it's blame. Blame is a big thing for me in that environment where there's a bad boss, I've got air quotes, this is an audio. But if you could see me I'm air quoting, the bad boss. There's often an environment of blame. And so you're constantly feeling like you've got this shield over protecting you from the blame, the finger being pointed at you.

Tonya Campbell:
So that's the opposite. But yeah, the beauty, if you can look at it afterwards is you can take that experience. If you're committed to being a good boss, you want to be a good boss in the future. You take that experience and you commit to not doing those things. And if you have no aspiration to be a good boss, because maybe you can go, let's be honest, not everybody aspires to leadership, but what you can learn from it is, what I went back to take us back to where we were earlier, which is knowing what to look out for when you are looking at changing positions in the future. Or it's, how do you sniff that out? How do you know when you're reverse interviewing for a boss? How do you know that that's the type they are? And my advice to people would be to ask about leadership style and more importantly, interview the people on the team, ask them how things are, right?

Christine Laperriere:
I'm smiling while you're telling this story. Because one of my famous moments in my career, I went to work for someone and prior to taking the job, I interviewed three different people that had worked for him. And every single one said, "Don't go work for him." And I said, "I get along with everyone." And then I proceeded to march off and go work for him and learned 18 months later that I don't get along with everyone. And I guess to your exact point, you go do your homework, but also to not be so naive that you do get ... Some of us walk in thinking, "Oh, but I'll be able to handle that. Well, I'll be able to handle that." But when you talk to three or four people and they all, don't feel like that person is the most empowering, just be prepared.

Tonya Campbell:
Yes. One red flag means talk to another person, two red flags. It's probably two red flags, and three is, definitely don't go there. But I would say, when do people not see the red flags? It's when they're desperate to get out of their situation that they're in right now. So that's if you're desperate because you're in the survival mode, you are more apt to make a mistake. And I would say that is when you need to be the most cautious and do the most due diligence. And on the flip side, I forgot all these juxtapositions, all these oppositions to each other.

Tonya Campbell:
The truth I think is also when you're in the thriving mode that I discuss or have shared with you. I think it's easier to find the thriving again, because it's like a snowball effect. Once you're in there, you just never really gravitate back towards them. So I think the truth could also be said about the bad boss situation, but I've seen people who've been able to navigate their way out and navigate their way back in by mistake out of desperation.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent. Any last tips for any leaders that are listening right now and they want to take something away, really tangible that they should implement next week?

Tonya Campbell:
No, I think that, for me, it's understanding your own style of leadership, and I think I've done some homework on leadership, I've read books and stuff. And if I were to describe my style and the styles that have really worked for me and for many people around me is, it's a servant style leadership. And I think if you're a leader, who's trying to figure that out and understand what they want to be. If you want to be the one that provides trust, who provides lots of instruction and gives people autonomy. If that sounds like the type of boss you want to be, then you have to understand what servant and style leadership is.

Tonya Campbell:
And that is that you work for those people, not that they work for you. And if you adopt that mindset, like I'm here to serve you. I'm here to make your job easier. I'm here to empower you. It means you're serving them. And so that's my view. It's not necessarily everybody's view and certainly other leadership styles work, but it's been my experience that when you look at it from that perspective, you see your employees differently, you see them as wanting to ... You truly, you genuinely want to understand. It's like I'm not doing this because the book said I should do it. I'm doing it because I serve these people.

Tonya Campbell:
And it really does for me, like when I understood that about myself, that that's what brings me joy in the work that I do. It completely changed everything for me. And it was a long time thing. It's not like I woke up one day and said, "Oh, this is what I am." It's just the old time I learned that. And so the advice I would give to people is, figure it out. Like what, what type of leader do you want to be? And if you haven't done the reflection, like what you and I have talked about today, Christine, which is, who were the best bosses? Who were the worst bosses. If you have, that's the very next step it would be, if you've not done that. Do it, and then figure out which pieces of the puzzle you're going to bring forward in your life and make a conscious effort to do.

Christine Laperriere:
Excellent.

Tonya Campbell:
My advice in a nutshell.
