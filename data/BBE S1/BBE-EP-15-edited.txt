Christine Laperriere:
Welcome to the Best Boss Ever podcast. I'm your host, Christine Laperriere, president of Leader In Motion. On this show, we're going to gossip about the best boss you ever had. We're going to hear stories about things that they did that helped you feel valued, helped you feel engaged and really inspired you. We want to hear about the bosses that change the way you look at everything. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.

Christine Laperriere:
Thank you, Mary, for coming on the show. I really appreciate it.

Mary Peterson:
It's great to be here, Christine.

Christine Laperriere:
And I'll say for our listeners sake, I had the opportunity to work with you at Samsung, as we were working to advance some of the high potential women that the organization has. So, it was just neat because I ended up sitting alongside you at an event and we got a chance to talk about how much passion we have for this topic. And since then, I've been a big fan of yours. So I'm thrilled that you took the time.

Mary Peterson:
Well, that's nice of you to say, and yes, I enjoyed working together with you and some of that diversity stuff.

Christine Laperriere:
So, today, of course, I'm going to ask you to talk about your best boss ever. And I know you have lots of thoughts on this one, so I'm going to hand it over.

Mary Peterson:
I mentioned to you already, and I'll say it again, that this was a thought provoking topic for me, because I think oftentimes I get asked to talk about my leadership or leadership, but this is really about my experiences. I look back on the many, many years of my career and who inspired me and what type of boss/people manager inspired me, which is different than the motherhood leadership kind of stuff. So, you got me thinking and I really had to put some time into thinking about this, but I think I've got it. And here's some of it.

Mary Peterson:
I started my career in technology in the mid eighties. This industry's come a long way since then, of course, but it also speaks to the fact that I've always been in an industry that's very fast paced and very innovation driven. And so while other companies, other industries, you might get into a role and keep within your boundaries, I think in technology, we were blasting all over because there was no real path to follow. So, we were charting our own paths in a lot of ways. So, combine that with the fact that young Mary gets on to the scene, very ambitious and very competitive and very ready to take on the world and in this very exciting dynamic industry. And so when I look at back at my best bosses, the ones that inspired me and made me better, it's based on that situation. And I think people management is so situational. And what worked for me, I'll tell you about that may not work for the same analytical, introvert person that maybe isn't quite as ambitious.

Mary Peterson:
So here we go. Okay. The first area that I categorized this in would be those bosses that eliminated fear. So, I have a couple examples of this and what that means really is, we can't create innovation. We can't create change, drive, change, drive results if we are fearful of our jobs of trying new things, et cetera, making mistakes. So, a couple of things. First of all, early career Mary. I'm in one of my first sales jobs and I'm ambitious and I'm darn it I'm going to hit my numbers. I'm going to be an overachiever, I'm going to be the top salesperson. I'm going to beat that darn competitor. And I'm going to go for it. I did my work. I did my prep. I did all of that. And once upon a time, I actually lost a deal. That was a big deal and I lost it. I was devastated, right? So this is early in career. I lost the deal. I thought I was all that. And I was devastated.

Mary Peterson:
I finally got the nerve, went into the office and told my boss that I lost this deal. And he said, "Come into my office." Come into his office, shut the door. And I thought, "Oh no, oh no, I can't believe. I've never been fired from a job. Here it comes, here it comes. How could this be?" And he said, "Okay, let's talk about this. So, did you follow the plan and the process that you've been trained and did you do what you're supposed to do?"... "Yeah, absolutely"... "Did you do the best you could on this deal?"... "Yeah, I put it all out there. I know I did that." He said, "Can you look back and potentially learn something from this?"... "Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about it and there was couple things that maybe I should have done differently."... "Did anyone die?" He said.... "No".

Christine Laperriere:
That's fantastic.

Mary Peterson:
No one died.

Christine Laperriere:
No one died.

Mary Peterson:
He's like, "Okay, good. Get out of my office. Learn from this, pick yourself back up and go win some more deals based on what you learned."

Christine Laperriere:
That's excellent. I'm smiling from ear to ear because sometimes you don't need to be beat up. You're already beating yourself up enough.

Mary Peterson:
We do it enough to ourselves for sure. And this person was just the first time that I thought, "Oh, okay, chill out a little bit here. We can do this. But we got to learn from it." And I'm sure the conversation would be different the next time, if I made the same mistake, which is also part of this living in fear and making sure you can try things, you can be innovative, but if you make mistake, learn from it and don't do it twice is. That's what I've learned later in my career too. So, even currently at Samsung, where I'm in a leadership position, rolling out new products. Some of these products are out there, it's different, different market, whatever. I'm thinking about one in particular over the last couple of years and it's a different type of product.

Mary Peterson:
So my team and I, we decided, okay, we're going to go try this really different type of distribution channel for it. Seems it makes sense. It's a huge sales force that could represent this product. It's a compatible market that they're in. This could be really something, if this takes off, boom, because the breadth and the scale of this could be incredible. Of course, I've told the executives back at headquarters, all of this that were going after it. Well, we trained them. We set up promotions and incentives. We invested in marketing to support this thing and guess what? It didn't work. It didn't work.

Christine Laperriere:
And what did you learn?

Mary Peterson:
And that's exactly, we learned that they weren't able to push something new into the same stakeholders. They weren't talking to the right person, the market wasn't quite right on with us. There's a list of things that we've gone through to say, "What did we learn from it?" And as long as you do that, we won't do this again. We'll make other mistakes, but we won't do this again. There're even stories if you look back at famous inventors in this world, right? Like how many mistakes did they make before they made that one big invention. The point being, take that knowledge, learn from it and create an environment. So, in my case, I'm in an environment with bosses that allow that to happen. But, I also try to create that environment within my team to don't be afraid. It made sense. It was a great bet. Let's go through it.

Christine Laperriere:
I love hearing that because I've worked with companies where there's zero room for error or there's zero room for a mistake. And to your exact point, it really kills innovation. I can even think of a few that might not come out of the pandemic that well, just from really forcing people to be terrified of innovating, because innovating means you could fail. You will have spent money on something that didn't work. I think you're right. I think this idea around fear, especially in the technology space, the last thing you want is people to be limited in their thinking.

Mary Peterson:
And there are still bosses that do create that. Make that deal at all costs or else... Or okay, you can have that money but, it better work.

Christine Laperriere:
Right. They don't want to take a chance on anything.

Mary Peterson:
I've also heard a term 'blame culture' too, which I think is part of that fear, right? You don't want to be the one, "Oh, that was the mistake Mary made" or "Mary made that and now we are all paying for it." You know what I mean? I just think fear and faith is such an important thing that I try to live with always. I can't live with fear.

Christine Laperriere:
So, what other things do you think of when you think of that best boss?

Mary Peterson:
Well, I also think about again, ambitious A type Mary. I was always going for that next thing. So, the way you get it is, you got to prove that you can do it or prove that you're the right person. So, I looked to a couple of bosses that supported me to put myself out there.

Mary Peterson:
So for example, one story in a previous employer where I was working in an area that was slightly different from the main business. So, they asked me to go in and talk to the senior executives, to some key stakeholders about doing this sort of leveraged business model in a very direct sales business world. And to propose that this would be a way for them to grow their business. So my boss came to me and said, "I'd like you to do this. A month from now, we'll book a meeting. We'll get all these people together and we'll present this plan. And again, it's off the side of your desk, because you're still busy doing whatever you have to do, but yeah, I'm all for it. Let's do it."

Mary Peterson:
So, I worked on this thing and I would take it to him and we would review it and get his feedback and we would work on it, work on, work on, and the day came and he says, "So, you're presenting it."... I'm like, "Oh, I thought you were and I would just be in the background."... He's like, "No, this is your plan, your idea, your work, you present it. I'll be in the room if you need me, but you're fine. Right?" And so off I went, little nervous in front of all these important people, but I done the work and I went out there and I pitched this plan and the meeting went well and afterwards the boss came to me and gave me all kinds of props, great job, excellent, et cetera, et cetera.

Mary Peterson:
And then he also told me, "Oh, by the way, so and so in the audience, the senior person, he sent me a text in the middle and saying, Mary is incredible." This is so great, blah, blah, blah and gave me this feedback. And so here I am sitting here, how many years later?, I don't even remember really what I pitched. I don't even really remember how much of it we did. But I remember how that elevated me, that I put myself out there. He gave me the opportunity to put myself out there, to challenge myself, to show everyone, to build my brand. He gave me of the opportunity to do all of that and be successful in a platform. He could have easily taken this and got the props himself. But he gave that to me. And so at the end of the day, I remember so and so that texted him about how awesome I was. I remember the feedback that he gave me. I don't even remember what we really talked about.

Christine Laperriere:
When I listened to that I'm grinning from ear to ear over here because one thing we don't think about is bolstering confidence. So, I hear not only were you given this great opportunity, which you totally deserved, but when you gain confidence in an environment, what you'll do next is even more powerful because you're not limited by your own internal voice of am I good enough? Am I smart enough? All of those things. And so that bolstering of your confidence is phenomenal.

Mary Peterson:
I agree. The layering of your career as you look back in your career and you say what were some of the turning points? And maybe that was a turning point that, "Yes, I can actually do this. And now I have the confidence and I'll do it again more often and it'll be more comfortable." And I think about that out as far as... There's often times and there's often organizations where we don't allow people to broaden their skills. They come in this job and they stay in that job. And when we go to hire something over here, "No, because she's that person, she's not good, she's really good at that." And I think that this example, but also earlier in my career and... I'll tell you Microsoft was really good at this. They would take high performers and move them into lateral roles, move them into different... They're a good salesperson, move them into a marketing role, move them into a services' role. And they would move, especially high performers around, to give them this rounded out. And I don't see that in enough organizations or enough bosses willing to do that.

Mary Peterson:
And one of my other examples about this was, and this is years ago, but I was in an individual contributor role at Microsoft, but it doesn't really matter. I was going on mat leave, which back then was only a six month leave, but I was going on mat leave and they said, "Okay, Mary, I want to give your job away. I want to hire somebody full time for your job because when you come back, I want to find you something better. So, do you trust me that I can go and back fill your job and trust me that I will bring you in at a higher level"... Because of course at that point I'm anxious to be a manager or whatever... "But I'll bring you in at a different role, a different level, and we'll move on from there"... Which again, showed sort of that boss and that environment, was all about creating opportunities to grow and develop and change and not while you're that thing. So we'll keep you in this thing and you will stay in that thing forever.

Christine Laperriere:
Again, like this is another moment where I'm just grinning from ear to ear because the number of women who apologize or feel nervous about leaving for mat leave. I know. I even did it during my first mat leave, I kept apologizing and I was scared of even trying to convince everybody that I could come back at the same level of performance. I wasn't even thinking about growth. I was just thinking, "Please, no, I'm not going to change."

Mary Peterson:
I'll be back. I'll be as keen as I ever was.

Christine Laperriere:
I think of how many people are nervous about when they leave. Will people view them as not being as high performing because they would've had this new life experience and they've been out of the office for six months and "behind", right. And I just think of all of that, that noise, and not only does it come from the outside and then obviously women internalize it. So, I listen to that and I go, "How cool is that?"

Mary Peterson:
And it's funny that if you and I are thinking about this, imagine how subconscious this is in so many places, but yeah, as far as the best boss and being able to create opportunities to develop and grow and challenge and change and lateral moves and all of those things that help us become better.

Christine Laperriere:
It's a really good point, he did not have a bias around maternity leave. As a matter of fact, almost did the exact opposite of what's instinctive. And I think that's kind of cool. You don't hear those stories as often. So, that's an interesting one. And like you said, lots of opportunity for you to grow. I'm sure you came back from mat leave feeling excited.

Mary Peterson:
I was so excited during that break about what the next things were. Yeah.

Christine Laperriere:
Amazing.

Mary Peterson:
So a couple of other best bosses I'll talk about, one is just, again, she was a boss a long time ago, but I think if I look back on somebody that I still to this day and it's been years. I don't even want to say the number, but it's been years since she managed me. But I often think back to how she would handle it because I just thought that she was just the full package. And the main characteristics that bubbled up to me with her was she kept her cool. So, she was calm. She didn't flail, she was calm and cool. I watched her in situations once where a customer/partner treated her very poorly and yelling like it was... It was a really bad scene and she folded her book and walked out of the room. And I thought good for you. Who knows? It's okay if she went to her car and cried, who cares? Right?

Christine Laperriere:
Right. She had enough dignity to say, I won't be treated like this. Thank you.

Mary Peterson:
So, and then I would see her just in any situation, whether it was customer, with executives, with whatever, it was always that same calm equals confidence personality. Her communication, I still remember, it'd be like, "Okay, you guys come here. I got to talk to you about something, the three of you come here. Here's what we got to do." It was always that keeping us on point, communicating what we needed to know about what was happening in a dynamic environment. She was always good at those little updates, those little things to keep us, "Okay, we need to maybe turn a little bit, but let's keep going." That was another one of her things.

Mary Peterson:
And then building strategies. So, okay, this is the ambitious person being inspired by this. She was managing the business, running the business, but she always had those little side projects that she was working on and you'd talk to her and she'd be like, "Yes. One of the things I'm working on...", There was always a problem solving piece that she was working on. So it wasn't a matter of somebody come to her and say, "Okay, time now to figure out X, Y, and Z". It was more like she saw situations that could be improved or fixed. And then she was always kind of working on them. And the next thing you know, they'd bubble up and we'd be executing them, but you know what I mean?

Mary Peterson:
And so this is somebody that I still go back to, "Okay, what would she have done?" This is steady base and maybe that's what I needed. I needed the steady rock. I needed this rock to drive our business and lead our business while I was doing what I do. So, I think that was part of it too, to be that rock. She was that rock for me.

Christine Laperriere:
It's an interesting one because having done these interviews, that calm leader paired up with a very ambitious, maybe emotionally tied passionate person seems to be an interesting combination that I've now heard quite a few times where it's like, there's that leader that is the steady, just like you said the rock and keeps everybody like, "Hey, no one died. It's all good. Everything's going to work [inaudible 00:17:05]." And then meanwhile, you have this passionate high energy, high potential employee and they get to come in and be all those things, but balanced with that, calm, steady.

Mary Peterson:
Yeah. It's a good point. And now that I'm a leader, I have to remind myself of that because I know where I revert back to. I know I'm more emotional person and I need to remind myself of that sometimes. And I need to remind myself to be that rock for others. And I also have to remind myself that when I'm with another me, that we can spin each other out of control. So that's when I know when I'm with other 'mes', I need to be the rock.

Christine Laperriere:
The rock. Exactly.

Mary Peterson:
I have to get back to the rock at some point.

Christine Laperriere:
That's right. Someone in the room has to be the rock. But I also love this proactive problem solving that she was doing off the side of her desk. And one thing I work with a lot of leaders who sometimes feel burnt out or they feel like they're not being used for their highest purpose, right? So managing a small team or rallying a small team is enjoyable, but when you've done it for a long time, it starts to lose some of its oomph. And so, I hear that proactive problem solving, I think that's a good example of a leader finding a way for her to stay motivated, like for her to stay inspired on the job.

Mary Peterson:
That might have been it, or it might have been the way she's going to be recognized and get ahead or could just be solve problems to solve. I'm not sure it was about keeping yourself busy in those days because it was kind of a crazy times, but still.

Christine Laperriere:
But given lots of energy and excitement sometimes around all those problem solving. So, that's cool. Those are fantastic stories.

Mary Peterson:
Well, I have one more and actually this one's on the same thing. It was the same company, different boss, also female, also calm and the rock. And I guess maybe that's what I gravitated to as far as strong leadership, especially when I was younger, but this boss had just the incredible ability to build strategy through and with the team. So, she was all about driving change, change leadership, doing new things, but she had this incredible ability to get everyone involved in building this. And I still think about it, some days I wish I could do this, but this ability to get a group of people together, start with the brainstorming, pick those key areas, start to move us forward, revisit it every couple of weeks with a group of people and be able to get to an incredibly great strategy and execution and drive some incredible change within the organization.

Mary Peterson:
And of course, if everyone's got their blood, sweat and tears in it, we're already bought in and it's going to happen. And there are times where it would be easier to go off and set this yourself than come to the team and execute together. But she had such an incredible job of building it with the others and then you've got the buy in and next thing you know, you're executing and her analogy she always used was getting on the bus. So, the process of getting, and I'm sure this is used by a lot of people, she probably didn't invent this, but I still, you use this all the time [inaudible 00:20:12] right. Just getting everyone on the bus, get them on the bus, then you're going to decide who's driving. Where are you sitting? How are you doing? Where are you going?

Mary Peterson:
Like we all are on the bus and we're figuring that out. And then we set the vision and we take off down the road. And there are times when some people are going to fall off the bus and we have to circle back up and pick them up because they didn't buy in. They don't agree. There're some problems we've encountered that we have to do it, but it's about setting the vision, sharing the vision, rules and responsibilities. Who's driving the bus, who's packing the bus, who's making sure there's gas in the bus. All of those things, rules and responsibility, so important to setting that up and then tracking the results. What's the map. Are we getting close to the right destination? Have we veered off course? Is everyone still on the bus? So, she would use that all the time, but she just had such a great ability to pull us all together and make this happen.

Christine Laperriere:
I love the analogy. We've heard the term, but actually it sounds even... it was used even more thoughtfully around strategy. It wasn't sometimes it's the cultural bust, but I'm hearing that it was also really used to the extent where we're trying to get to a destination and we're going to keep talking about it, right. And I think sometimes those models, when you think of how people's brains interpret information, would be so helpful, because not everybody has a strategic brain. And so I hear this sometimes where it's hard to get everybody aligned on strategy. This sounds like it was built for everybody to be included.

Mary Peterson:
She was incredible at doing that and pulling a lot of people together. The joke is, and I still stay in touch with her to this day, it'd be like, she's the friend you want to come over when you have to move your house or something too. Right? She pull it all together and get it done.

Christine Laperriere:
So, she would obviously bring everybody into the room and get them working on the strategy. But tell me even any specific tactics you saw her do that made it possible because I see leaders run sessions and they dominate the whole session.

Mary Peterson:
No, she would do it at the... She's very methodical, but she would get us in the room. I remember several examples. One time we were at her cottage and oftentimes it would be... You don't realize it's a burning platform yet. She's found this burning platform, so she's getting us all involved. So it's about brainstorming and what's important to pull forward. And then we take that or we take the three things that we pulled out of that. And then we go two weeks from now, the next degree together as a team, getting through. And along the way, there might be some takeaway or some follow up. But it's not everyone, "Okay, one to 10, everyone take a topic and come back and report to me." No, it would be if there's a subject matter expert that would take that off, otherwise no, it was... And oftentimes she would do a lot of the... "Okay, pulling it together to make it easier for us kind of thing."

Christine Laperriere:
Sounds like she has that ability to facilitate the conversation and make sure people feel included and then the strategic vision as well. So she knows where she's trying to get everybody in that session.

Mary Peterson:
And brain platform was also one of her taglines too. So it was like, we all needed to believe in this brain platform along the way too, which was part of keeping people on the bus. If you didn't believe on it, then let's go back. Let's circle around. What could we do to address this differently? Is this something we want to fix and change or build.

Christine Laperriere:
But that's a great example of getting strategic alignment and ownership. It's such a perfect example of that. I see so many leaders who set the strategy and then they talk, talk, talk it down into their team. Not that there's anything necessarily. That's the traditional way that it's done. But what I'm hearing here is she's not leaving the station unless everybody's on the bus.

Mary Peterson:
Exactly and so we were all on. So, by the time we were bringing this to mainstream, we all believed in it. We were all passionate about it. We'd all put our blood, sweat and tears into it. And we were going to make this happen versus the change that comes from above and is handed to you, sometimes doesn't... It takes more revs to get everyone bought in.

Christine Laperriere:
And we already know if you're not fully bought in, even if you're partially bought in, we don't put our blood, sweat and tears in the same way. So, if I signed up to get on that bus, I'm going to feel much different about the journey than if I got pushed into getting on the bus.

Mary Peterson:
Even if you're on the bus and you're not really sure where it's going, as long as you're there for the journey, even if you jump out then, "Well, okay, there's something wrong. Christine jumped out of the bus. Let's figure out why."

Christine Laperriere:
It's such a good a story. And it's really making me think a lot about the leaders that I work with who have important strategic outcomes they're trying to accomplish. And maybe the ways that they could approach that. Well, Mary, knowing that most of the listeners here are either ambitious types that are on their way to management. Or we have some folks that are in management who are ambitiously working to be amazing leaders. They're not settling for less. What would be any last words of wisdom or nuggets that you think could really help that audience along?

Mary Peterson:
I think going back to the things that I started with, first of all, I don't know, I call it faith, not fear or you can't live in fear. So, if you're in a situation where you're being forced to be in fear, there's something wrong with that. And that needs to be addressed either it's in you and your confidence and your ability to do something or it's being pressure put on you. And nothing good happens from that. We need to be confident and faithful, but I always think faith, not fear... We need to know that we can do this and we'll be all right. And nobody dies and nobody loses their job. And as long as you only do it once, make a mistake, break glass, try things, be curious, that's all part of this faith, not fear piece. Be curious, try new things, don't be fearful or you won't ever push the limits.

Christine Laperriere:
Oh, I love that. What a fantastic theme. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I've really appreciated our talk today. It's been fantastic. If you want to hear more, join me at christinelaperriere.com and sign up for our newsletter, The Whipp.
